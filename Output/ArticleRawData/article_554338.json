The Baathist regime's whole response has shown its bad conscience; Mr. al-Assad and his followers appear to have been afraid that the demonstrations would keep getting larger and larger.</p>", "<p>The armed insurgents in Syria will have a hard time attaining outright military victory, but they have a good chance of carrying on a long-term war of attrition, in which the eventual advantage will not be in the regime's favour - its narrow support base in the Alawite minority is a fragile one.</p>", "<p>Moreover, the conflict is taking on international dimensions, with Turkey giving haven to refugees, and at least tolerating the presence of some of the Syrian insurgents. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish Prime Minister, has made clear that civil war in neighbouring Syria is an unacceptable threat to Turkey.</p>", "<p>Qatar, with its highly idiosyncratic foreign policy (being an absolute monarchy that selectively promotes democracy abroad) has been one of the main forces behind the Arab League's willingness to take on an activist role in the internal affairs of a few of its members. But the reluctance of some Arab states to take up some an unfamiliar task has resulted in a mission that is too small to observe effectively what is really going on in the streets of the cities of Syria.</p>", "<p>When Mr. al-Assad spoke to Barbara Walters of ABC News in December, he almost admitted he was fully in control of his own security forces. This week, he looked much more confident when he spoke for 100 minutes about Syria being the heart of the Arab world - as well as the victim of a conspiracy. That sense of assurance is a dangerous delusion.</p>"], "author": "GLOBE EDITORIAL"}}
