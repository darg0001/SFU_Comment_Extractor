In the first half of 2011, there were 190 targeted killings, according to the UN.</p>", "<p>Insurgents armed with machine guns and suicide bombers are storming schools, hospitals, municipal buildings and even mosques, during prayers and funerals.</p>", "<p>The goal is simple: to keep Afghanistan in chaos and ungovernable.</p>", "<p>With NATO countries eager to get out by 2014, a lot of effort is going into building up the army and police so the Afghans can defend themselves.</p>", "<p>But if Afghanistan is to become a country that can stop relying on outsiders for help, these killings need to end. If and when peace talks begin, Canada must push this issue.</p>", "<p>The Canadian International Development Agency allocated $206-million from 2003 to 2011 to set up a functioning government. Some of the money paid the salaries of civil servants and teachers - who are among those being assassinated.</p>", "<p>But it is not only NATO countries who have an interest in this. Senior Taliban figures keen on peace would no doubt negotiate for a role in any future government. They also have a stake in making sure there is an educated population left who can administer and develop the country when foreign forces leave.</p>"], "author": "GLOBE EDITORIAL"}}
