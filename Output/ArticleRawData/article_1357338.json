With the province becoming a destination for immigrants from all over the world, it has an opportunity to build public schools that will bring people together. Instead, the effect will be to emphasize separateness.</p>", "<p>The province should weave diversity into the public system. Canada is full of examples of how to do this. Toronto's board offers after-school minority-language instruction. Edmonton offers special schools in the public system for minority languages. Montreal, despite some notable controversies, has been accommodating to people of many cultures and faiths.</p>", "<p>The wave of immigration from Asia, Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America that has changed Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto broke late in Saskatchewan. It is now arriving. That will be a boon. There will be new sources of labour, new talents, new residents who can help drive economic growth, new sources of creativity, art and food.</p>", "<p>The province's new rules give students in 'qualified independent schools' 50 per cent of the per-student funding in the public system. The province already funds 'associate schools' - another set of independent schools - to 80 per cent of the per-student public average.</p>", "<p>A diverse population needs strong core institutions. It needs rallying points and meeting places, especially for its young people. John Tory, running for Ontario premier as a Progressive Conservative in 2007, was thrashed by voters when he tried to extend funding to faith-based schools (beyond the existing Roman Catholic system, which is publicly supported, and which, unfortunate though it is, has its roots in Canada's founding). He failed to appreciate how strongly the public favours integration and worries about isolation.</p>", "<p>Diverse public schools are a multicultural society's best way to promote unity, while still preserving difference.</p>"], "author": "GLOBE EDITORIAL"}}
