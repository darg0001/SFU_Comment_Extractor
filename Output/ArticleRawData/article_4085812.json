One of the two papers uses a method intended to replicate 'the back-of-the-envelope calculation' by which many consumers compare prices in the two countries, adjusting for the currency difference.</p>", "<p>In fact, American and Canadian price levels do affect each other, but imperfectly. They tend to move closer, crossing paths, only fleetingly staying together.</p>", "<p>Curiously, when the Canadian dollar is falling, Canadians do not suffer as much from the rise of the U.S. dollar as would be expected - and do not fully benefit from greater purchasing power when the Canadian dollar strengthens.</p>", "<p>Some factors in the divergences are readily understandable from people's ordinary experience. Though most Canadians live fairly close to the U.S. border, almost all cross-border shoppers incur some transportation costs, such as gasoline.</p>", "<p>The American poet Longfellow was not thinking about cross-border shopping when he originated the metaphor of ships that pass in the night; nonetheless, his image expresses the all-too-fleeting convergences of Canadian and American prices.</p>"], "author": "GLOBE EDITORIAL"}}
