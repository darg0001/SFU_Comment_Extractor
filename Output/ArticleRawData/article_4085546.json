The son came to Canada at age 7. The father went to jail for six years, beginning when the son was 12, but was not deported because of concerns that Egypt under president Hosni Mubarak would torture him.</p>", "<p>Mr. Es-Sayyid was one of six children raised by their mother on welfare. He earned no high school credits, was a chronic juvenile offender and got involved in armed robberies after age 18, involving handguns and sawed-off shotguns. He preyed on marginalized women working in massage parlours, believing they would not contact police, and was sentenced to 21/2 years.</p>", "<p>The Canadian government argues, reasonably, that he is a present and future danger to Canada. He has no close friends, no job skills, and is a substance abuser. Even a brother, who owns a business, did not sign a letter promising to employ him.</p>", "<p>So what is the humanitarian case? He was deprived of his father's influence in his formative years. 'Since my dad has been incarcerated, I have not had a role model or a father figure.' A lawyer went even further, on his behalf, seeming to blame Canada for what the son became: 'His behaviour, although unquestionably wrong, was also an understandable reaction to what he and his family had been put through. Cynicism and selfishness were not ingrained traits, but defence mechanisms.'</p>", "<p>Leaving aside whether a suspected terrorist makes a good role model, Canada is not to blame for what Mr. Es-Sayyid made, or didn't make, of his life. The Federal Court of Canada was right to be unmoved by his plea for a humanitarian case against deportation.</p>", "<p>As the dust settles in the new Egypt, Mr. Jaballah could some day be safely deported. The son could then have his role model.</p>"], "author": "GLOBE EDITORIAL"}}
