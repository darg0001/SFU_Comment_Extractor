First, on Tuesday, its spokesman, Pantelis Kapsis, raised the possibility that Greece would leave the euro, if the negotiations on the next instalment of rescue measures - worth about EUR130-billion - do not make good progress. Then on Wednesday, Lucas Papademos, the Prime Minister, raised the prospect of 'disorderly default' if those negotiations - with the so-called troika of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund - do not succeed before early March.</p>", "<p>These statements are not in themselves outrageous, but the acknowledgment of these risks from such sources is provocative. Mr. Papademos, almost universally classified as a technocrat as opposed to a politician, took office when the troika - and the international policy community as a whole - became fed up with the Greek political class. But the new government of experts is adopting its own rhetorical poses.</p>", "<p>To whom are these messages addressed - to the troika and the bondholders, or to the Greek labour unions and the Greek people? Probably, to all of these. And that is as it should be. Some reports suggest that the Papademos government is on its way to obtaining significant concessions from both the international bondholders and the central body of Greek private-sector unions.</p>", "<p>The euro and the euro zone can live on, with or without the small Greek economy. And one way or another, the Greeks will have to cope with lower price and wage levels for several years. What is to be avoided is disorderly default, panic, runs on banks, and an inability to conduct the most ordinary commercial transactions. If the European Union cannot prevent all that, its competence to do much of anything will be in doubt.</p>", "<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Papademos seems to be playing his weak hand well.</p>"], "author": "GLOBE EDITORIAL"}}
