Please!I know I see 'fire breather' when you have people say about 47% of people dependent on the government, or something to the similar tune about abortions, or what Santorum said about gays to deserve santorum described as a noun.A discussion about immigration is long overdue, particularly in US. In fact, Harper led all of his campaigns on promises to fix immigration, and some of his fixes, including changes to treatment of asylum seekers, are not that different from what Trump proposed - the sole difference is that it was discussed in rational terms. So is free trade, with Obama unilaterally gutting NAFTA in favour of TPP, without letting the Congress even read the agreement as his administration re-negotiating it - in fact, Harper received a lot of criticism over his similarly heavy-handed push towards free trade.And, finally, I find the personal insults to the tune 'so and so is a vile person because he hates me' far more honest than the Obama-style attacks that 'so and so belongs to a vile group of people because that group of people to which I belong'.
