It was purchased for $1.1 billion by the NY Times waaayyy back in 1993. Just two years later, the Globe started its website, which was a pioneer in a barely understood digital world. Lots and lots of money spent trying to figure out how to do it, who should do it, and how to make it pay. How'd it work out?Well, in 2009, the company took its unionized workers to the chopping block, asking for 20 million (yes, million) in cost savings. Still not enough to stem the loses.So, the NY Times did what it needed to do: sold the losing paper, 'investigative team' and all.

Mr. Martin is usually less heavy-handed than the commissars at the Star, but his columns would fit in there nicely.

Now he wants taxpayers to fund a Ministry Of Truth, with Minitru newspapers available for all. Well, we already have the internet, radio, and TV versions of that: our national broadcaster.

I pay roughly $45 monthly for internet, although it's part of bundle of services so might be somewhat less. I get about 90 television channels for the equivalent of about $80 to $90 monthly, or about $1 per channel. So, is a paywall-limited internet news site 10 times more valuable to me than, say, the CBC, or CNN, or TVO? Hmmm... To me it's the relevant question. Were paywall-limited internet news sites bundled in a fashion would allow me to buy access to, say, 8 or 10 different sites, I might well consider buying such a package. This would, of course, require a new business model, which to date hasn't emerged. Otherwise, I simply can't afford to leap the general paywall barrier that's emerged.

Even after the Ontario Press Council got involved, condemning this and obtaining assurances from the Globe's editors that it would produce more accurate reports, the prevalence of such reports only increased, and the Council was forced to remind the Globe on at least five occasions about its commitment.The media's shoddy reporting can be seen in the cases of Iraq, Lebanon, Gaza, Palestine, Libya, Syria, Ukraine, Yemen, etc.Or the economic depression caused by the abject failure of the deregulation and privatization schemes forced on us under the guise of 'free trade' and 'globalization' - which was predicted by the millions of people being gassed and beaten in the streets (and slandered collectively as 'violent anarchists' by the same media that helped sell these ...

It's easy to find out about the real stuff that our media isn't reporting on; just go online and look around, get informed. Our media is left-wing biased because it doesn't tell the truth. It sanitizes, hides, distorts, and outright lies so that you can't make an informed opinion and you'll stay ignorant of the facts. That's just what the liberals want so they can push through their agenda. You will never grasp the dishonesty of left-wing MSM if you don't already have a grasp of what's real."}, {"reactions": {}, "post_time": "Feb 2, 2016", "author": "flogger", "text": "(In reply to:Of course it's biased to the right - media here are mostly owned by super-rich one percenters.

In Scotland/UK on a Sunday there are, on typical newsagent's shelves, about a dozen different newspapers. And at least half-a-dozen of these Sunday newspapers were in separate sections, including a magazine. It would take all day to read one newspaper. Many households, mine included, bought two or three Sunday newspapers.That was 19+ years ago and I don't know if it's still like that in the UK or if the internet has changed things.I have also noticed that Canada's media in general is strongly biased to the right-of-centre."}}
