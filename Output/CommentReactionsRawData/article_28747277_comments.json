At party conventions, they control a lot more of the policy debate, and more of them are elected making them a larger portion of caucus than they should be.So the Conservatives in Canada are suffering in the same way the Republicans are suffering in the US -- ideological extremism has taken root in the parties, giving the ideologues more control than they really should. Such extremism doesn't bode well for future growth for the Conservatives in Canada.But in the US - where politics is extremely polarized and only 5-10% of voters can be considered swing voters (v. about 30% of voters in Canada and growing) there is no incentive to purge the ideologically extreme from the ranks of the Republicans."}, "512406": {"reactions": {}, "post_time": "Feb 16, 2016", "replies": [{"reactions": {}, "post_time": "Feb 16, 2016", "author": "You Get What You Pay For", "text": "Well said.

The niqab was not deliberately taken up by the Conservatives as part of an election platform. Nevertheless, because there was an election going on people took a stand on the issue. The LIBERALS -- not the Conservatives -- decided to exploit the issue for political gain.The other thing that you TOTALLY missed is that there was nothing illegal about the Conservatives pursuing the niqab issue. They were simply moving through the courts as is often done for any issue that has policy implications.You have not mentioned the 'snitch line' -- another example of leftist exploitation, but I am guessing that this too is in your soiled bag of 'racist' slurs. If so, you would have missed that although this was characterized in the media as a 'snitch line' it was in fact a help-line for victims that some immigrant womens' groups had been asking for for years. Sorry but the 'racist' claims against Conservatives are nothing but dishonest political smears."}], "author": "LLucas", "text": "'the 'tone' problem. By tone, they mean things such as race-baiting , enemies lists and running a closed government.' No, Mr. Martin -- by 'tone' they meant the relentless nasty and false attacks from the left. Harper was vilified from the day he took office. The press -- often happy to go along with a false narrative (race-bating??? really???) so long as it made the Conservatives look bad. As an example, you want to re-read this silly, biased column by Mr. Martin, attacking the always respectful Mr. Harper (Merkel 's words), a thoughtful, hardworking and moral leader. Like most on the left, Martin seems to prefer the shallow showmanship of a man selected primarily to manipulate the public as a distraction from the unerhanded globalist policies that will weaken Canada and hurt Canadians."}}
