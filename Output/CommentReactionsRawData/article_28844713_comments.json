The outcome has been that the taxpayers have been propping this company for years. The real winners though have been the controlling share holders, namely the Beaudoin family. The dual share structure allows for the Beaudoin's to pay themselves rich dividends to support their lavish lifestyle while the company and the non-controlling shareholders have been bleeding. Another undertaking by the Liberals in favour of Bombardier at this time will do nothing but perpetuate and exacerbate the situation.
