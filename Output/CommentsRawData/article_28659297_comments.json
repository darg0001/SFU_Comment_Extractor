Also, the lack of a third party renders the choice a \"either/or\" proposition for most American voters, who tend to stay home in droves, particularly in years where a presidential choice is not on the ballot. And the 2-year term system used for the House of Reps tends to exacerbate the impact of powerful lobbies and big money as fundraising for re-election supersedes independent and rational decision making in importance.
