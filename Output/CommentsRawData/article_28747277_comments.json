Its 'socialist' caucus is little more than a rump, never carrying more than 5-10% of votes in a convention, but is loud enough for the media to think it's bigger than it really is.  The moderate left stance allows the NDP to remain a political player - garnering a traditional 15-20% of the vote.Unfortunately for the Conservatives, the right-wing ideologies are in greater supply in that party - and do have relative control.  At party conventions, they control a lot more of the policy debate, and more of them are elected making them a larger portion of caucus than they should be.  So the Conservatives in Canada are suffering in the same way the Republicans are suffering in the US -- ideological extremism has taken root in the parties, giving the ideologues more control than they really should.  Such extremism doesn't bode well for future growth for the Conservatives in Canada.But in the US - where politics is extremely polarized and only 5-10% of voters can be considered swing voters (v. about 30% of voters in Canada and growing) there is no incentive to purge the ideologically extreme from the ranks of the Republicans.

Wait!  That was the Liberals in Canada!!   The fact is that the Liberals of Canada and the Republicans of the US are just flip sides of the same coin.   In the US, they vote for an idiot who is going to 'Make America Great again' and they did the same thing here to the cheers of ''Canada is back' - both are facile.  In the US its all about making the Rich, richer - in Canada, its all about making Quebec richer.  But we are worse.  In Canada, Trudeau told us his tax increases were going to be 'revenue neutral - he lied.  He told us he was going to bring home the CF-18 as soon as he got elected - he lied.  He told us he was going to bring in 25,000 refugees before Christmas - he lied.  He told us he would run $10 billion deficits per year - he lied.  So when the Republicans get people to vote for them despite their lies over and over again while hiding behind the facade of 'country'.  Here it is the Liberals who are the low info voters that hold the same kind of nationalistic zealotry that the Republicans count on down south.  And how precisely is the type of bigotry exhibited by Trump, any different from a Canadian PM who publicly says 'The problem with Canada right now is that it is being run by Westerners - Canada runs better when it is Quebecers in charge'.   Like the Republicans down south, (and including Palin up north) they are convinced they hold the moral high ground despite all the evidence to the contrary - ditto for the Liberals in Canada.  The problem in Canada isn't our democracy - its getting Liberals to look in the mirror.
