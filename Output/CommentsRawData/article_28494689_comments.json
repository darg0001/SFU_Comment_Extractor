Four full-time staffers, the paper's 'investigative team' slaved for months without writing ONE WORD. I just cringed at the money the expose cost that newspaper. Did circulation zoom to new heights because of it?  Maybe...but not high enough, and not for long enough.'Its about selling papers/websites with as little cost outlay as possible.'  Well, as it takes a heap of money to simply ESTABLISH a website, and a lot of head-scratching to figure out how to 'monetize' the thing, your comment is a typical 'corporate sneer.' The Boston Globe is an interesting case.  It was purchased for  $1.1 billion by the NY Times waaayyy back in 1993.  Just two years later, the Globe started its website, which was a pioneer in a barely understood digital world. Lots and lots of money spent trying to figure out how to do it, who should do it, and how to make it pay.  How'd it work out?Well, in 2009, the company took its unionized workers to the chopping block, asking for 20 million (yes, million) in cost savings.  Still not enough to stem the loses. So, the NY Times did what it needed to do: sold the losing paper, 'investigative team' and all.  The company that had bought it 16 years before for over a billion walked away with a mere $70 million.   And counted themselves lucky to find a buyer (the owner of the Red Sox) willing to take the risks and weather the storms.

Now that Mr. Martin is feeling almost desperate for his team's $$$, he is inclined to talk, with the natural liberal and Liberal conclusion: taxpayers' money is required.  When Postmedia was Southam, it employed columnist Lawrence Martin, who then as now, was fundamentally idealogical and politically partisan.  Mr. Martin is usually less heavy-handed than the commissars at the Star, but his columns would fit in there nicely.  Yes, he helped oust Chretien (as did the late Jim Travers and a host of liberal heavy-hitting newspaper columnists,) thinking that a smooth transition to a new party leader would be a piece of cake.  The Martin-Chretien wars were were a deadly surprise, and it took a decade to work back to ground zero, which was only accomplished by finally running The Anointed One, a Kardashian candidate who nailed Toronto and thus the country.What Mr. Martin is lamenting are The Good Old Days when CBC, Southam, the Star, and (sort of) the Globe and Mail, had a dead lock on dictatorship of opinion and news.  Now he wants taxpayers to fund a Ministry Of Truth, with Minitru newspapers available for all.  Well, we already have the internet, radio, and TV versions of that: our national broadcaster.  With enough Liberal funding, CBC could also do print.  Why complicate matters with other versions or companies?If you read the Postmedia papers for the two months before the election, you'll see that they were slamming Harper as hatefully as the other papers in town.

The problem with MSM is that they have alienated they audience by assuming that we are nothing more than stupid rubes who can't in any way understand the depth of our ignorance or the brilliance of the professional elite journalists.  The media landscape has changed.  Access to the internet has brought a wealth of voices out of the shadows to add real voices to the discussion. News is no longer screened through the bias of the MSM.  Thousands of bloggers bring new information to the mix - some are idiots, but many of indepth knowledge of the topic they are posting on (I think of The Black Rod out of Winnipeg who reports on the often wrong doings of Winnipeg city council and the provincial government - he has broken and followed more stories that the MSM can only hope to cover including the financial irregularities of the CDN Museum of Human Rights while the Winnipeg Free Press acted as cheerleader rather than journalists).  Witness the climate change 'debate' - when global warming was presented as a fact in the mid 1990s, the MSM covered it as they had sole rights to pronounce judgment on ending the 'debate', only to find that the media world changed under them and they no longer had sole coverage on global warming,  In fact there were bloggers out there that had more science credentials than the professional journalists - the result - only about 3% of the public think global warming/climate change is a big threat and don't believe anything that the MSM have to say on the topic.  And what does the MSM does - blame everything and anything on climate change and man-made global warming and they get shriller and shriller about it. So the answer is NOT a public and expensive inquriy, but some deep soul searching by the professional class of journalists about where they went wrong.  But I doubt that will happen.

But you ignore the two elephants in the room.The first, of course, is that throughout the 90\u2019s, right-wing ideologues bought out much of the media, centralized their operations, and fired much of their staff, mainly to stifle diversity, frighten those who remained into acquiescence, and push their ideology, all in an attempt to shift the tone of debate in this country.Secondly, the public\u2019s confidence in the mass media is at an all-time low, and that is because most media corporations have essentially stopped doing any sort of investigative journalism, and instead began regurgitating misleading Narratives on world events, especially on economics and conflicts, which conspicuously suppress any mention of the key facts contradicting them \u2013 which can now be easily found within the independent/alternative media outlets that proved their mettle while the bulk of the press was busy sacrificing its credibility in service to the Pentagon and US State Department in the lead-up to the criminal invasion of Iraq.In regards to the illusory crisis over Iran\u2019s atomic energy program, which extremists in the US and especially Israel had hoped to leverage into war with the oil-rich regional rival, the Globe published very misleading reports, which downplayed Iran\u2019s cooperation with the IAEA and made it sound as if it had done something wrong. Even after the Ontario Press Council got involved, condemning this and obtaining assurances from the Globe\u2019s editors that it would produce more accurate reports, the prevalence of such reports only increased, and the Council was forced to remind the Globe on at least five occasions about its commitment.The media\u2019s shoddy reporting can be seen in the cases of Iraq, Lebanon, Gaza, Palestine, Libya, Syria, Ukraine, Yemen, etc. Or the economic depression caused by the abject failure of the deregulation and privatization schemes forced on us under the guise of \u201cfree trade\u201d and \u201cglobalization\u201d \u2013 which was predicted by the millions of people being gassed and beaten in the streets (and slandered collectively as \u201cviolent anarchists\u201d by the same media that helped sell these \u2026 \u201creforms\u201d) for opposing and trying to prevent them.The media repeated this shameful betrayal when the so-called Trans-Pacific Partnership was being created, once more behind closed doors and kept out of the public eye by the press. Even though Wikileaks published numerous drafts, the media produced no detailed analyses of the deal.

Sometimes we don't have answers, just questions. Martin has some. Good. However, he also makes some arguable statements.  Allow me to argue a bit. 'But it\u2019s a joke to think a healthy democracy can be restored given the continuing depletion of the one industry that holds business and government to account.'Based on numbers who went to the polls last year, Canadian democracy doesn't yet need restoring. Newspaper amalgamation and closures are hardly a new phenomenon. Sometimes its not lack of classifieds.  Sometimes it's been union wage demands. and its not just newspapers: back in 2009, Canwest closed down a TV outlet in a provincial Capital--Victoria B.C. Staff bought it and it continues to operate; in the 1980s, small town radio took a hit when satellite radio first appeared. Who'd listen to Fort St. John radio when you could hear New York radio? Now there are more, not fewer, small-town stations. Not EXACTLY as they used to be--especially around ownership and technology--but more efficient than ever.'Newspapers being reduced to digital edition...'  Why is the death of hard-copy bad?  Why is a digital edition seen as something less? On-line comment pages serve many times the readers than restricted 'letters to the editor' space ever could. Journalists theoretically now have no space limitations. They keep writing, I keep scrolling. Oh, wait, I get it: lost jobs. Dislocation isn't new, either. The energetic, imaginative, sometimes, the merely desperate change, grow and create--as Julian Assange did-- 'the next great thing.'Mr. Martin asks, 'How many important stories, controversies, scandals have gone uncovered and will go uncovered as a result [of job loss]?' I have another question that just recently occurred to me:  'Would the stories make a difference? HAVE the stories made a difference?'The 21st century's greatest threat to democracy, certainly the greatest abuse of power in any western nation, came directly from the White House in the guise of 'Counter-terrorism.'  The print media was all over it, long before digital media took hold. Story after story. Hard-copy books!  Dozens of them before, during and after USS Cole, Afghanistan, the debacle in Iraq and the WMDs fiasco, and on and on. Did all this make a difference? Did it stop Chaney or Bush? Did the public clamour for transparency? The restoration of the Geneva Convention? Media was often co-opted. The REAL threat to media came from 'embedded' reporters and shaky, gee whiz CNN 'combat' footage. Rumsfeld must have loved it. Today--the amount of info regarding all of this and much, much more is available to the public--on line. Get in minutes, right in your own home. New stuff, old stuff. Newspapers closing print editions? Well, I never wrapped garbage or fish in it, so I shrug. The real question: how do we get the public to bother to READ the stuff--in any format--and care about it?

That is in itself a loaded phrase that people on the right (mostly) use to attack any media they don't like as being 'biased'. A public broadcaster is supposed to act in the public interest and that does not mean pretending to be perfectly neutral or unbiased, which is impossible. Your claim they won't make a positive contribution is ridiculous. You claim some knowledge of Scandinavian media, but somehow fail to point out that those are ALL socialist democracies, so of course their media reflects that. What you are really suggesting is that IN SPITE of the fact they're overwhelmingly socialist their public media should be giving equal time to right-wing politics and theories that they reject. That's just stupid. Of course not just the CBC but the BBC and NPR and lots of other public broadcasters play incredibly important roles. Especially if original journalism is declining in the internet age we need funding for journalism in the public interest, and that can ONLY come from the public. In fact, quite the opposite of what you suggest: it is privately owned corporate media that are relentlessly non-neutral and shamelessly biased. 75% of them supported the conservatives, because they're not neutreal they're spectacularly rich 1%ers with a selfish agenda. And yet here you are repeating the manifest LIE that the media is leftie dominated and biased. It's clearly false, and you believe it because it's what the rich right-wing owners of places like Fox and PostMedia tell you to believe. You're a sucker.So it seems pretty obvious that actually it's ONLY a public broadcaster that can provide these benefits and avoid these problems. But is better journalism what really want?
