The outcome has been that the taxpayers have been propping this company for years.  The real winners though have been the controlling share holders, namely the Beaudoin family.  The dual share structure allows for the Beaudoin's to pay themselves rich dividends to support their lavish lifestyle while the company and the non-controlling shareholders have been bleeding.  Another undertaking by the Liberals in favour of Bombardier at this time will do nothing but perpetuate and exacerbate the situation.  So, it is a no brainer: no help unless the share structure is changed and control is transferred to professional management with the interest of all shareholders and tax payers in mind.

(http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/19/new-language-talk-economy-politicians-theories) Wildly inappropriate metaphors use the image of 'households' to leverage discussion about a national economy into childish, morality laden homilies about debt. No matter that if a household was like a national economy, it would print money in the basement, it would be empowered to tax its neighbours, issue bonds etc, etc, etc.Similarly, the public's expectations and understanding of government are out of whack. Democratic governments are necessarily cumbersome and fallible. Shaping public policy is complex; it's an iterative and collaborative process. However, as long as the government is acting democratically, transparently and in good faith, it's doing its job. There will inevitably be mistakes.

The kind of Prime Minister who instead of trying to pick refugees from Syria by religion, we have the Prime Minister making a special trip to Toronto to greet the first Syrian refugees arriving when the new policy came into place.Instead of a government that labels any critic of Isreal as an anti-semite,we have a federal government taking a more balanced approach on the middle east. The list goes on and on and on.We are mostly so relieved, so happy that we have a Prime Minister who is moderate, who is not a control freak, who is pro feminist, who doesnt try to stop inquiries into the tragedy affecting first nations people and women, who seems to be both smart and disciplined like his dad, and kind and gentle like his mom. Who appointed a cabinet with 50 percent women.Far from perfect. And good for Mr. Martin to tell us some of the problems that seem to be arising. But based on that mean minded small minded dictatorial bunch we had to put up with, its like a breath of fresh air.
