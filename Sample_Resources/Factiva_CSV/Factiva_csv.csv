The site matches then and now photographs taken at the exact same location.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Launched on Christmas Day, the blog – at changingvancouver.wordpress.com – already has more than 50 entries complete with historical background and information on architects and builders.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">It is an irresistible time waster.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The blog is produced by Andy Coupland, a London-born city hall planner, and John Atkin, the historian and heritage advocate. It is a follow-up to The Changing City, their book of walking tours published last year by Stellar Press.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The contemporary photographs are shot by Mr. Coupland (pronounced coop-land), who strolls city sidewalks armed with a digital camera, a tripod and a wallet of black-and-white prints as he seeks the precise spot where the historical photographs were taken.

That ordinary, ho-hum, never-give-it-a-second-glance Standard Life Building office tower at Howe and Dunsmuir? It stands on ground once occupied by the many-gabled Manor House Hotel, which boasted a wraparound porch on all three levels, as well as a bell tower overlooking the intersection. The Manor House was designed by William Blackmore, a British-born architect who skipped debts in Winnipeg and Minneapolis to set up practice in Vancouver a year after the city was founded.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">One of the blog's most shocking contrasts is the pairing of today's parking garage with yesterday's modest shops at the corner of Granville and Cordova.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“That single storey is so much more interesting than the parking garage,” Mr. Coupland said. “It's interesting how busy that corner used to be, and how dead it is now.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In that one block, now relegated to memory, can be told the story of a city.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Along Granville Street could be found a lunch counter and an office of the Railway Express Agency, which shipped parcels. There was also a barber shop operated by James Willows; the Wigwam novelty store offering native crafts and Japanese porcelain; and a furrier. The corner was occupied by Wilson's, described as the Post Office News Stand in the city directory.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">A star-shaped neon sign advertised the Star Weekly magazine, while other exterior signs promoted <span class=""companylink"">Coca-Cola</span> and Sweet Caporal cigarettes. The newsstand is open to both Granville and Cordova Streets, attracting customers from the train station (now Waterfront Station) and the post office (now Sinclair Centre).</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The adjacent fur store was founded by the Lando family. Lou and Sara Lando's son, Esmond (Bud) Lando became a prominent lawyer and sportsman in the city, while his wife, Edith, was named to the Order of Canada as a “quintessential volunteer.” Their children are known for their own volunteer and philanthropic work. One of them, Barry Lando, worked for a quarter-century as a producer on CBS's 60 Minutes.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">All of which is more interesting than a parking garage.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">While the blog has so far used archival photos, Mr. Atkin is dipping into his extensive collection of private, never-before-seen photos dating from more recent decades.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Among these is a 1962 shot of the Courtesy Kitchen, serving Chinese and Canadian food, at the corner of East Broadway and Scotia.

But the need for caution remains. For one thing, it remains unknown what options the minister will consider and what will result.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">For another, what's plain is that, even after a big victory such as same-sex marriage, equality can be eroded in incremental, bureaucratic ways.

Previewing his coming report, Don Drummond publicly pronounced that economic growth had permanently stagnated under Mr. McGuinty's watch, meaning the province's entire model of program spending was no longer sustainable. And by the way, some of the Premier's proudest investments – smaller class sizes, for instance – were poor value and should be reversed.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But on Thursday, Mr. McGuinty and his advisers were sanguine.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">They were evidently prepared for the stories that ran that morning in The Globe and Mail and the Toronto Star, likely because they were in the loop about Mr. Drummond giving interviews. And they seemed perfectly happy for the Premier to spend his first public event of the year talking about the economist's broadsides.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">To understand why that is, it helps to bear in mind that – from the perspective of Mr. McGuinty and his Finance Minister, Dwight Duncan – Mr. Drummond's commission on public-service reform is increasingly being viewed as an exercise in table-setting.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The government might have hoped, when it struck the commission last spring, that answers to get out of deficit would be provided. But while it still might find considerable value in many of the report's roughly 400 recommendations, the report is unlikely to be the blueprint for the next provincial budget. Instead, the Liberals are clearly hoping that Mr. Drummond's doom-and-gloom will provide political cover for their own, somewhat milder austerity plan.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The Liberals probably won't commit to getting annual spending increases in health care below 3 per cent, as Mr. Drummond has proposed; they certainly won't scrap their own signature education policies. If they reject Mr. Drummond's unusually pessimistic forecast of 2-per-cent economic growth in perpetuity, and bring in some additional revenues by cancelling planned corporate tax cuts, they should generally be able to promise fewer cutbacks than the ones Mr. Drummond will call for.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But with a $16-billion deficit, and credit agencies threatening downgrades, whatever the government comes up with still won't be an easy sell.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Not to the workers in the broader public-sector – doctors and teachers among them – whose contracts will be up for negotiation this year. Not to the general public, which was hardly well-served by a recent election campaign in which all three provincial parties glossed over the leaner times ahead. And not to many Liberals themselves, including some of the ones around the cabinet table, who hardly got into public life because they were looking to cut things.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Those realities will be a little harder to deny now that Mr. Drummond is using his commission's platform to more or less pronounce that the province is in crisis.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Meanwhile, Mr. McGuinty will be able to point to Mr. Drummond's proposals as he tries to make his own more palatable. Where the economist has recommended what the Liberals planned to do anyway, his report will provide justification. And his more draconian ideas will be pointed to as grim inevitabilities if the Liberals' alternatives aren't adopted.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Of course, Mr. McGuinty's decision to appoint the commission could still blow up in his face. If Ontarians look closely at what Mr. Drummond has to say – at his implicit (and in some cases direct) criticism of the Liberals' record – they might reconsider the steady-hand pitch that helped the Premier get re-elected this past fall.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But Mr. McGuinty is making the best of a bad situation. And this week's communications, however counterintuitively, were viewed by his office as a good start.</p>",ONTARIO ECONOMY,,6 January 2012,Column,Why the doomsday report is not all bad for McGuinty,,ADAM RADWANSKI   ,©2012 The Globe and Mail Inc.

Five years ago, the Conservative government established a working group of health experts, industry members and senior officials to develop a plan. That plan, three years in the making, centred around the drafting of voluntary targets for salt reduction in prepared foods such as waffles and cookies.

You can count 20 or 30 workers in a single gang, showing why this kind of shovel-ready work became such a favourite of governments. In the beginning, at any rate, paving roads employed a lot of people.</p>",Document GLOB000020120102e81200008,,A11,769 words,,"<p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Canada now has something approaching 900,000 kilometres of paved roads, the United States 6.4 million kilometres – taken together, a vast expanse of heat-absorbing surfaces. Yes, road building has changed. Work crews are smaller, paving machines bigger; and highways are faster and safer than ever. But highways fill essentially the same single, simple function they filled a hundred years ago – roads without bumps.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">This could soon change. This year, U.S. inventor Scott Brusaw will build a small prototype of the world's first solar-powered, electronically controlled, glass-surfaced highway on a parking lot near his lab in the small community of Sagle, Idaho.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The U.S. government will fund the experiment, which will cost a mere $750,000 – less than the cost of paving one kilometre of road. Mr. Brusaw, an electrical engineer, will seek to demonstrate that his smart solar road panels have the capacity to convert the U.S. highway system (and, by extension, Canada's) into a huge power generator theoretically capable of producing three times as much electricity as the U.S. now consumes – and almost as much as the entire world now consumes. By Mr. Brusaw's calculations, this highway-based power generator would produce so much electricity that highways could be heated, all winter long, to 40 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Could solar-powered highways really mean an end to snowplows and icy roads? Mr. Brusaw says they could. He cites the rear window in cars: A glass plate is embedded with a heating element that can “crank up to 85 degrees Fahrenheit” to clear the window of snow or ice. His solar-heated highway would be permanently heating (during winter months) at 40 degrees Fahrenheit. meaning snow wouldn't accumulate in the first place.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Brusaw's solar panels measure 12 feet by 36 feet. Mimicking the rear window in a car, the surface level is made of translucent glass, textured for traction. (Glass is 75-per-cent sand, a common enough raw material.) Beneath the surface are heating elements and an array of LEDs, light devices that move electronic data and activate sensors. At the bottom of the panel, a “base plate” distributes power as required – to the road-surface information systems, to the pavement-warming systems and to transfer of surplus electricity energy storage tanks and to the continental grid.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">For the motorist, the sensor devices inside the glass panel would “paint” illuminated lane-passing lines to guide traffic and would “print” warning messages – stop, slow down – on the roadway ahead as conditions required. The messages would be calculated and confirmed every 12 feet of distance travelled. This isn't as improbable as it sounds. IBM has already shown the use of roadway sensors to deliver road-condition reports.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Based on an assumption of only four hours of sunlight a day, and only 15 per cent efficiency in the capture of solar energy, Mr. Brusaw says a continental installation of smart roadway panels would generate enough electricity to power the U.S. 24 hours a day. Much of the country's highway system is massed on the East Coast and the West Coast. Thus the “lit” (day) portion of the continent would generate enough excess electricity to power the “dark” (night) part.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Brusaw's vision is intriguing. The technical credibility of the concept itself has been demonstrated. The 2012 prototype will assess the economics of “commercializing” it. Mr. Brusaw thinks a solar-powered kilometre of highway could pay for itself in six years – but, deeply in debt, governments can't afford the up-front investment. Governments will need to take highways private – or quasi-private – to produce super-smart, solar-powered roadways. The real barrier, after all, is neither scientific nor financial. It's institutional – and, lamentably, ideological.</p>",TECHNOLOGY,,2 January 2012,Comment Column,No more snowplows or icy roads?

Eventually, you subside.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">These objections miss the point. Worse, they actually make the point – in favour of the office's establishment. Yes, religion has not only been oppressive in the past but, in many places in the world, still is.

The second confirms the appropriateness of a country such as Canada undertaking it. A beacon of religious freedom itself, it thereby expresses its concern that other countries share this blessing.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">There's a lot of careless invocation these days of “separation of church and state.” This isn't a Canadian doctrine, and is only very dubiously an American one. (In recent years, U.S. courts and scholars have offered a more nuanced view of permissible co-operation between the state and faith-based organizations to achieve legitimate secular ends such as education and social welfare.) Even if you adopt this term as your mantra, however, it doesn't preclude a public stand on behalf of religious freedom. On the contrary, it implies one.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Religious freedom is precisely what the secular state was invented to secure. To the great philosopher John Locke (1632-1704) and the Enlightenment thinkers who followed him, religion could be free of coercion by the state only if the state was freed of coercion by religion. Instead of there being an official or established church whose bidding the state was obliged to do by suppressing or otherwise disadvantaging rival churches, religion would be disestablished. The state would go its way, and the churches theirs. Never again would any church get the state to do its dirty work.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But nor would any church be permitted to recruit anyone else to its dirty work, either. There remained one crucial function for the state to perform within the realm of religion. In undertaking it, however, it acted in its secular capacity rather than in a religious one. That task was precisely to enforce freedom of religion.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Freedom of religion is not religion itself, and to promote it is not to support religion (even if, on balance, religion benefits from its promotion). For freedom of religion, banishing all coercion from the religious realm inevitably entails the freedom not to be religious. The church of one's choice at which one worships can be no church at all. And if one does choose to worship at a church, it can only be at a tolerant one, one that has laid its arrogance aside and recognized the right of all human beings to worship at any church or none.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Freedom of religion is not itself religious; rather, it reflects the modern decision to put and keep religion in its proper place. It's best conceived not as sui generis but as one of the larger basket of personal freedoms, protection of which defines the core of liberal democracy.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">So, far from contradicting Canada's commitment to secularism and tolerance, the creation of an Office of Religious Freedom will affirm it. Its goal will be the promotion not of religion as such but of respect for the rights of the individual in matters of religion. Its task will be to press illiberal regimes to treat religious dissenters more liberally. This will doubtless prove an uphill struggle, for, historically, freedom of religion has flourished only with other liberal freedoms.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Yes, there are many pitfalls here, but the impropriety of the very notion of an Office of Religious Freedom isn't one of them.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Clifford Orwin is a professor of</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">political science at the University</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">of Toronto and a distinguished</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">fellow at Stanford University's</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Hoover Institution.</p>",OFFICE OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM,,9 January 2012,Comment,"Embrace this blessing in disguise; Freedom of religion is not itself religious – it puts religion in its proper place, argues Clifford Orwin",,CLIFFORD ORWIN   ,©2012 The Globe and Mail Inc.

Nobody had heard of stock options then. He lived in a nice house, but not a mansion. He did not make 250 times more money than the average Canadian, as some top bankers do today. Sometimes, he sounds rueful that he missed out on the bonanza years, when executive pay zoomed into the stratosphere. Mostly, though, he thinks the world has gone a little nuts.</p>",Document GLOB000020120105e8150001l,cacfpa : Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives,A17,764 words,,"<p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">So does Roger Martin, dean of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto. He says the way we pay executives today is ridiculous and perverse. And he thinks the worm may be about to turn. “Greed,” he says, “is not quite as good as it was before.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">A new report by the left-leaning Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives is helping to stir the pay pot. It found that the country's top 100 CEOs (that is, the 100 highest paid CEOs of companies listed in the TSX index) make, on average, $8.4-million, which is 189 times more than the average wage. Three-quarters of their income typically comes from stock options, which are tied to the company's stock-market performance. In 2010, average Canadian salaries went up 1 per cent. Theirs went up 27 per cent. Even in bad times, executive compensation just keeps going up.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">I'm no class warrior. If Frank Stronach can bully Magna's board into paying him $62-million, well, good for him. After all, he started the company. But what about the hired guns, which is what most CEOs are? Although their pay is supposedly related to performance, it's grown faster than a patch of kudzu vine in Georgia. In just 20 years between 1980 and 2000, says Mr. Martin, CEO pay per dollar of net income produced went up by a factor of eight.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">How did things get so out of whack? The answer you usually get is that the world is far more complex than ever before, companies are bigger and more global, outstanding talent is in short supply, blah, blah, blah. All true. But Mr. Martin believes there are more compelling reasons. In the 1970s, a series of economic shocks led people to focus on the types of incentives that might produce prosperity. That's when the idea of tying pay to performance was born.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">At the same time, the talent premium was soaring in every field, from sports to music. It seemed logical that top corporate leaders also deserved a piece of the upside. And then the cult of the CEO began to take off. Suddenly, bankers weren't boring, faceless drones any more. They were on the cover of Fortune. Soon, some of them were getting paid like rock stars.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The trouble is that corporations picked the wrong incentive. Instead of tying compensation to performance in the real world, they tied it to the stock price. This was one of the lousier ideas in the history of capitalism. It meant that the way to win was not to sell more stuff or make more money, but to increase the stock price. Much mischief has ensued, which you can read all about in Mr. Martin's excellent book, Fixing the Game. He thinks stock options should be abolished, period.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Stock options were not the only instance of perverse results. In the mid-1990s, public companies had to start disclosing the salaries of top management. It was thought that making this information public would help keep executive compensation in check. In fact, it triggered an ever-upward spiral. “It was like Lake Wobegon. Everybody said, ‘We don't want our CEO to be below average.' ”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Martin's crusade to pull the plug on stock options hasn't caught on just yet. But he's hopeful that the zeitgeist is changing again. Conspicuous consumption is out. Modesty, restraint and social responsibility are in. Today's business hero isn't the guy who builds a 60,000-square-foot mega-mansion. It's Steve Jobs, who lived in a relatively ordinary house.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“I think we've reached a tipping point,” Mr. Martin says. “I think enough people have begun to ask, ‘How is it that executives get to make lots of money even if the company doesn't do well?' ” That's what my friend who used to run the bank wonders, too.

Mr. Romney will need more to run on than his résumé at <span class=""companylink"">Bain Capital</span>, which is all he has done until now.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In the race for the Republican nomination, Mr. Romney has narrowed his pitch to a single selling point – namely, that he is the turnaround artist needed to get the economy going.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">That may be all he needs to win next week in New Hampshire, where he holds a 25-point lead in the polls in the run-up to the Granite State's GOP primary on Tuesday.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But in a general election, sticking to that narrow focus could be risky. Mr. Santorum, the pious father of seven and ex-Pennsylvania senator who finished eight votes shy of a win in Tuesday's caucuses, showed why.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">His speech on Tuesday helped the GOP establishment understand how, without money or organization, Mr. Santorum won the hearts of 25 per cent of Iowa's GOP caucus-goers.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Santorum spoke of his Italian-born grandfather who worked in a coal mine, and recalled hovering, as a child, over his coffin, staring at his “enormous” hands.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“And all I could think was, those hands dug freedom for me,” he told the crowd, before segueing into an explanation about why his humble roots would allow him to win over working-class voters in November.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“Those are the same people that President Obama talked about who cling to their guns and their Bibles. Thank God they do,” he asserted. “They share our values about faith and family. They understand that when the family breaks down, the economy struggles.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Santorum's 15 minutes will likely soon expire, just as they did for every other tentative alternative to Mr. Romney for the GOP nomination in the past six months.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">He has yet to bear the brunt of negative ads or face intense media scrutiny. Given the increasing ugliness of this campaign, Mr. Santorum is bound to get caught up in the nastiness.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">What's more, his Senate career, which ended in defeat in 2006, was marked by a rigid social conservatism that ultimately made him too hot to handle for his own constituents. His rivals are already calling him one of the worst pork-barrellers in Congress.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But juxtaposing his Tuesday night speech with that of Mr. Romney exposes the weakness in the ex-Massachusetts governor's argument – namely its emotional emptiness.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“I will go to work to get America back to work by making America once again the most attractive place in the world for job creators and innovators and investors,” Mr. Romney told the crowd in Des Moines. “I'll keep our tax rates competitive.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">No doubt, the consultants who drive Mr. Romney's campaign have tested these sentences in focus groups and found them to be effective with an economically scarred electorate.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Still, Americans do not want their leader to act as if he is battery-operated.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Obama has spent much of his presidency appearing as if he, too, might have a lithium-ion power pack under the hood.

And while her demographically weighted solution to the problem will be music to the ears of some provinces, it is certain to be met with fierce resistance by jurisdictions such as Alberta that would pay a steep price.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Although Ms. Clark's position certainly threatens any hope of the premiers emerging from their meetings with a consolidated position on the new funding formula, it is not the only area in which there is expected to be deep disagreement.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">While some provinces regard the payment scheme that Finance Minister Jim Flaherty presented the provinces in December as merely the starting point for negotiations on a new health-care funding model, others accept Ottawa's view that it is a non-negotiable offer and that the best that can be hoped for is some tweaking to address unintended problems of the nature Ms. Clark has outlined.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The talks are certain to highlight just how radically health-care policy in Canada is about to change under the Conservative government. After decades of complaining about the strings that Ottawa has attached to health-care funding, the provinces will now be able to do what they want with that money.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But with that freedom comes more responsibility and the ever-increasing pressure that rising health-care costs are putting on budgets.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">To that end, the premiers are expected to talk about joint strategies they can undertake to help slow some of those cost drivers. Those discussions will centre around initiatives that individual provinces have taken to reduce expenditures (innovation success stories), new funding models that are helping to shrink outlays, and ways to improve quality in the system that are also leading to savings.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall and Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty intend to press for an innovation fund that would help underwrite initiatives that would produce efficiencies in the system, such as electronic health records.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But before the first ministers get there, there will be more talk, some of it no doubt heated, about the funding model Mr. Flaherty unveiled to the premiers as a fait accompli.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The current health accord with Ottawa expires in 2014. Mr. Flaherty presented the premiers with a plan in which annual increases from the federal government stay at the current 6 per cent until 2017 and thereafter are tied to inflation and economic growth until the pact expires in 2024.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Almost immediately, the new deal that allocated funds on a per-capita basis rather than giving poorer provinces a disproportionate share of federal health dollars was hailed by growing and economically robust jurisdictions like Alberta, which will be the biggest winner under the revised formula. Provinces such as Quebec and Ontario, among others, were not as thrilled as they are likely to receive proportionately less money than they do now.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Ms. Clark, who will chair the first ministers' meeting, concedes that there are varying views among the premiers about Ottawa's offer.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“Some think of it as a starting point for negotiations, and others look at it and see it as a position that can be shaped and improved but not through a full-blown many-year-long negotiation,” Ms. Clark said in an interview. “Personally, I think we need to be focusing on a decision that we can shape.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">On that note, the B.C. Premier is going to table a proposal that seems fair on the surface but is certain to engender resistance from some of her colleagues, mostly notably Alberta Premier Alison Redford.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">While B.C. is pleased the new funding model leaves all decision-making on how it will be spent up to the provinces, Ms. Clark says it does not recognize demographics, which are a huge cost driver in the health-care system.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“I think the consequences of the new model, unintended as they are, are going to be severe for seniors all across the country,” Ms. Clark said. “The decision to go to straight per capita regardless of age represents a massive shift in health-care dollars away from senior citizens. We can't sustain a health-care system across the country under those circumstances.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">As such, B.C. would like to see the funding weighted to take into account senior citizens leaving snowbound outposts in Alberta in retirement for milder locations in its province.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In Canada, people between the ages of 65 and 75 cost the health-care system nearly triple what those under 65 do. Seniors 75 and over, meantime, are twice as expensive as those between the ages of 65 and 75.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“Straight per capita means you're giving a lot less money to provinces where seniors reside and a lot more to provinces where they don't,” Ms. Clark said. “So in B.C. where a lot of people move as they age we're going to see a growth in our allocation under the Canadian Health Transfer (CHT) of .05 per cent. In Alberta, they're going to see a growth in CHT of about 50 per cent.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Officials in the B.C. Ministry of Health have run numbers of what a new health funding formula might look like if it was weighted for demographics. Not surprisingly, B.C. (along with Quebec and New Brunswick, among others) would do much better, and provinces such as Ontario and Alberta would be worse off.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">This is why Ms. Clark's proposal is likely to be one of many difficult discussions Canada's premiers are going to have at this meeting.</p>",PROVINCIAL TALKS,,14 January 2012,Column,Debating a new model for health care; This week's conference in B.C. will hear arguments from premiers on demographics versus per-capita allocation of funds,,GARY MASON   ,©2012 The Globe and Mail Inc.

The Harper government wants it built so badly it launched a campaign this week attacking opponents as radicals and puppets of foreign interests. Call that one the Prime Minister's pipeline.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The Premier's pipeline is the $1-billion Pacific Trails project, and construction is expected to begin this summer.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Both projects are bound for the port of Kitimat – the Gateway to be loaded with crude oil from Alberta; the Pacific Trails carrying natural gas from northeast B.C.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The Gateway proposal has generated an incendiary debate, with concerns about potential oil spill disasters – whether from leaky pipes or from the coastal tanker traffic – running smack up against a nationalist fervor to free Canada's resource industries from unfavourable dependence on the U.S. market. Pacific Trails, by comparison, has sailed through the approval process. Opposition New Democrats support the project. It has broad first nations buy-in, and the Clark government sees it as the key to developing a liquefied natural gas industry. It is a fossil fuel business that, relative to the oil sands, comes with a green seal of approval. But both developments bring environmental impacts to Kitimat's doorstep, and the province has little idea what the cumulative result of all this industry packed into the community will be.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">There are 13 regions in B.C. with an air quality management plan, but none for Kitimat which, despite the massive aluminum smelter perched on a hill to the west of town, is regarded by the province as having excellent air quality.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Between the Premier's ambitions and those of the Prime Minister, that could change. The pipelines are meant to end at Kitimat's port. The oil would be pumped into supertankers. Natural gas will be processed into LNG before moving on to the busy tanker port for transport.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">B.C. Environment Minister Terry Lake is expecting to have on his desk this spring a technical review of the Gateway project. It's not meant for public consumption, but it will guide his government in forming an opinion on the oil pipeline that would cross the province, and the oil tankers that would traverse the treacherous B.C. coastline.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Even with that information, the B.C. government probably won't come out clearly for or against the Gateway proposal. To say “no” would infuriate the conservative wing of the B.C. Liberal Party, which is being assiduously courted by the new B.C. Conservative Party. A “yes” would drive the influential green vote into the arms of the opposition New Democrats.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“It may sound like waffling,” Mr. Lake said in an interview. “But we want to listen to all of that information so that we understand all the possible ramifications and then decide how we react.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">B.C. has forfeited its opportunity to say no to Gateway formally, having signed a pact years ago giving the federal government control over projects that cross provincial borders. So the only aspect of development it can control is the LNG side. And there is growing uncertainty about what that will look like.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The province is expected to unwrap its natural gas strategy later this month. The Premier wants the jobs associated with an LNG industry, but there are complicating factors. Creating LNG is an energy-intensive process, and <span class=""companylink"">BC Hydro</span> doesn't have enough clean, green hydroelectricity for the three facilities Ms. Clark wants to see there. That means some will likely be burning natural gas to provide their own energy.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">If it turns out all this industrial development can't safely be sustained by Kitimat's air shed, will the province have to scale back its own objectives? Mr. Lake said there is no point studying the issue now, since the Gateway hasn't been approved yet and the extent of the LNG industry is still uncertain.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“We can say ‘these are the things we would like to see happen,' but we can't know for sure all of those things will happen, or can be done in a way that makes sense from an environmental point of view,” Mr. Lake said. “We're not saying these will happen come hell or high water.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">*****</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">AIR QUALITY</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The B.C. government has not studied what will happen to the air if Kitimat becomes the epicentre of a new liquefied natural gas industry plus the marine terminal for the Gateway oil pipeline. But Enbridge, the pipeline proponent, has done some modelling. The Kitimat Terminal “has the potential to measurably affect air quality … during the construction and operations phases,” states a study filed by Enbridge as part of its massive application to the National Energy Board.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Each year, approximately 220 tankers are expected to call at the marine terminal. Three tugs would assist each tanker in the three-hour process of berthing. After that, each tanker would be on standby for approximately 16 hours, all the while running steam and auxiliary boilers to keep the bunker oil hot and pumps running. Add just one LNG plant and, at maximum levels, the result would exceed air-quality objectives.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Karen Campbell, a lawyer at Ecojustice, said the report underscores the need for the province to look at air quality before signing off on any more industrial development in Kitimat. “At some point in time you are going to have some serious issues with the air quality in that air shed,” Ms. Campbell said.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Justine Hunter</p>",BC POLITICS / DISPATCH,,13 January 2012,British Columbia News: Column,"Two pipelines, two sides and a battle that's in the air",i13 : Crude Oil/Natural Gas | i1 : Energy,JUSTINE HUNTER   ,©2012 The Globe and Mail Inc.

These parties cost nothing and restore a faint sense of the 19th-century New England town hall meeting to the race. With only modest further adaptation, Canadian politics could benefit from having its own U.S.-style caucuses, the peculiar candidate-selection gatherings that turn political races into community discussions.</p>",Document GLOB000020120109e8190000h,,A13,732 words,,"<p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Take last week's Republican caucuses in Iowa, all 1,700 of them, as an example. Organized as separate decision-making events in every precinct (or ward) in the state, Iowa's caucuses are the very essence of grassroots politics. Anyone can participate, merely by registering at the door – and independent Iowa voters did so last week, helping to set an attendance record. A single caucus typically attracts 60 or 70 voters who are able, in the course of an evening, to explain their choice of candidate. In the end, voters gather in groups and vote publicly – no secret ballots here – in a counting of raised hands.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The theoretical flaw in the caucuses is that they slightly modify the principle of “one man, one vote” – by favouring partisans and other knowledgeable, articulate voters. This is also the primary benefit of the caucuses. Recall Winston Churchill's dictum: “The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Although marginally elitist, 19 states still use the caucuses in one form or another; 15 per cent of the delegates eventually chosen to attend the national conventions are determined by them. In Texas, for example, Democrats select 70 per cent of their delegates by a primary election, 30 per cent by caucuses – specifically to preserve the influence of party members who are more politically involved than the “average voter.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">At the same time, the caucuses preserve a grassroots populism that frightens some candidates. “They pick corn in Iowa,” Jon Huntsman, the former governor of Utah and former ambassador to China who aspires to the White House, said dismissively before the Iowa caucuses. “They pick presidents in New Hampshire.” Well, perhaps. But his explanation for blowing off Iowa sounds dubious. Since the 1970s, this farm state has served as a good, low-budget way for improbable presidential candidates to get noticed – which nicely balances whatever theoretical defects the caucuses may have.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The Iowa caucuses propelled Jimmy Carter, an obscure Democratic governor from Georgia, in 1976. (His second-place finish, behind “uncommitted voters,” made him look like a winner.) They propelled Barack Obama, an inexperienced Democratic senator from Illinois, in 2008. They propelled Republican Mike Huckabee, an unknown governor from Arkansas, in 2008; although he wasn't able to convert his first-place finish into a presidential nomination, he did get his own TV show on Fox. And they propelled Rick Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania – at least as far as Tuesday's primary in New Hampshire.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Iowa perpetuates other candidate-selection traditions. Last August, in Iowa's famous “straw poll” – the country's first popularity contest for Republican candidates in an election that doesn't count – former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty finished a distant third and abandoned his candidacy the next day. In an age of scientific polling, the straw poll might seem antiquated. In fact, it activates people months before real elections take place.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The American pursuit of the presidency, in a presidential election year, is perhaps the world's most mesmerizing democratic spectacle – a process that manages to produce a national consensus on presidential candidates within four months of New Year's Day. Or earlier. The great party conventions that will be staged this summer to nominate the Democratic and Republican candidates for the presidency will be held to affirm this consensus, not to form it.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The paradox is that the Iowa caucuses, like Iowa's straw poll, decide nothing. They exist only as an advisory to the state's summer convention delegates, all 25 of them (amongst 2,200 for the country), who'll be selected in elections in coming months. Yet, though meaning nothing, they decide a lot. And they're great fun.

No alcohol.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Billy Ding wrote me a letter. He is by no means the first restaurateur to try to capture my attention, but this guy tugged at my heartstrings pretty efficiently. He wrote: “I was a flight professional in Hong Kong. My ramen noodle master for three years taught me to hand-make good quality of ramen without putting any chemical and preservatives into it. … I am still bearing in mind that my Japanese master told me that ‘if I came and visit you and find out that you use chemical and MSG, I will be absolutely disgrace.'”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">So every day Billy only makes a certain amount of ramen, just enough for that day, and when he sells out, he closes the door to Jyuban Ramen House, which is in a quite large strip mall in Markham. A very special strip mall in that it also houses about a dozen Chinese restaurants, from which emanate the most wonderful smells.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">I am, as faithful readers of this column will recall, mad for ramen. I have rarely met a noodle I didn't love, and the combo of noodles with rich chicken or pork broth is enough to make my day. Especially in the winter. Could there be a better comfort food?</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But the problem with ramen is that most of it is so loaded with preservatives and MSG that we're getting a truckload of artificially jumped-up flavours. Which may be okay, depending on your feelings about chemicals in your food. Here's the thing: I prefer my food chemical-free. Billy's ramen is for sure purer than most of the other ramen in town. And the flavour buzz is … quieter. Which just serves to remind how addicted we've all become to chemically jacked-up tastes.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Billy makes three different kinds of ramen: For the pale-green spinach noodles, he grinds spinach into juice and mixes it into unbleached flour, which is then kneaded. Same deal for squid-ink pasta, and egg noodles get real eggs as opposed to the more common powdered eggs. The results are noodles with good strong flavour. Billy also eschews potassium sorbate, the noodle “strengthener” commonly used to give ramen both smoother texture and longer shelf life.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Jyuban's menu is small, as befits the maven of fresh-made daily noodles. The room is a standard ramen shop – unadorned, a variation on the fast-food theme. The pale green and cream walls and high ceiling are plain but soothing. It is a place of calm.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But avoid the apps, which I find nasty. The menu says shrimps kinpura are “absolutely different texture from tempura.” The server calls them tempura when she delivers them, and they taste and feel like lousy tempura, both greasy and mushy.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But the ramen is impeccable. Number 9 super-bowl ramen refers not to a football game but to the plethora of stuff in the bowl. There are all three kinds of noodles – spinach, squid ink and egg, each with its own characteristic taste. There is barely cooked bok choy, sweet pickled egg with properly oozing yolk, corn, green onions, fresh scallops in the shell, New Zealand mussels, sweet-cooked pork and diverse unidentifiable cuts of beef that are also sweet and almost tender. The broth is lighter than the usual ramen broth, with vegetable undertones.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The classic Japanese favourite ramen, tonkotsu, is pork-bone soup (pork bones simmered for many hours so that the stock catches all the flavour of meat and marrow and becomes milky) with egg noodles, corn, sweet pickled egg, boy choy, sweet pork and green onion, with crisp nori on top. The tonkotsu broth we're accustomed to is stronger than this, but it leaves me wondering: Have our taste buds become so addicted to chemical flavours and the artificial taste sensation of MSG that we don't like the real thing as much when we meet it? This is sort of like the problem I have with deep-fried food, which I know is not good for me. Offer me a choice between a shrimp tempura and a naked shrimp and I would rather eat the one in batter. I know it's not the right choice, but my palate has been trained to love crunch and grease, so I crave it.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Same deal with Jyuban's chemical-free broths. They feel almost too light on the tongue, and yet I know they're intrinsically better than the chemical-ridden standards of the ramen world. Is one to re-train one's palate to appreciate (and one hopes, eventually prefer) more pure food? I can't instruct you on that. I can tell you that Jyuban Ramen is a good place to start.</p>",THE DISH,,14 January 2012,Globe Toronto Column,Jyuban: Where ramen purists get their fill,i661 : Restaurants/Cafes/Fast Food Places | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos,JOANNE KATES   ,©2012 The Globe and Mail Inc.

That said, it was certainly a shrewd decision to plan his much-hyped poverty reality show for January – a notoriously slow news month in which the carcass of anything that even resembles a potential story can be chewed over for days by reporters.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Consequently, the news media have joined Mr. Brar for virtually every step of his journey – from the emotional goodbye to his family as he headed out the door to begin it all to his cheerless account this week of trying to find accommodations that he didn't have to share with an extended family of cockroaches.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Brar says he spilled tears imagining those who have to live their life in such spiritless and depressing surroundings. We'll have to take his word for it – about the tears, that is. Only six days into his adventure, Mr. Brar seems to have the media hooked – or at least on the hook to cover the story every step of the way. So to that extent, the stunt has worked brilliantly.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">I realize that may seem harsh, but, unfortunately, it is true. After a month “living on welfare,” Mr. Brar won't have a true understanding of what it's like to be poor and raising kids and having to go out and find a job in a jobless market. In a month's time, he'll go back to living in his beautiful home and the comfortable life that a salary in excess of $100,000 a year affords him.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">To hear Mr. Brar say, before he started his challenge, that he worried for his health was almost laughable. He is a big, fit-looking man who once played international basketball for India. Sure, he may drop a few pounds, which for most people after the holidays isn't a bad thing. There are people on January cleanses who will lose more weight than Mr. Brar does over the same period. He will never know what it's like to get near the end of the month with no money left and have to forgo food for the sake of kids who need it more.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">And there is no one who knows that better than New Democrats themselves.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Back in 2004, Liberal MLA Lorne Mayencourt decided to spend a week living on the streets of Vancouver.

Premier Christy Clark decided last spring to don a waitress's apron and serve coffee for a couple of hours in a bid to “walk in the shoes” of those making minimum wage, the ploy was universally derided.

It is intended to do one thing only: embarrass the government. And I suppose people are invited to imagine how it will all be better if and when the NDP gets into power.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">I'd have more respect for Mr. Brar if he eschewed crass political theatre and offered concrete solutions to a real public-policy dilemma. It's fine to say welfare rates are too low and the life they afford good, honest and decent people is immoral. But what will the New Democrats do? How will they change welfare policy in the province to make life easier for those on it? How much will they raise the rates? And where will the money come from?</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Even if Mr. Brar pledged on behalf of his party to end the shameless policy introduced under the Liberals to claw back every dollar a welfare recipient makes while on the dole, it would be more valuable than pretending to be poor.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Brar should know that it's tough to quit poverty.

The so-called Arab Spring has not been good news for them. In October, 27 people died when security forces opened fire on a crowd of peaceful demonstrators who had gathered to protest against church burnings. And last week, a teenaged Coptic boy was arrested for posting pictures of the Prophet Mohammed on his <span class=""companylink"">Facebook</span> page. “Copts worry that even mainstream Muslims don't really care that much about the defence of Coptic rights,” says Paul Sedra, associate professor of history at Simon Fraser University.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In Bangalore, India, 200 activists from a right-wing Hindu group invaded a Christian church during Sunday prayers, and attacked the pastor for allegedly trying to convert Hindus to Christianity by offering them bribes. “We were informed by a family member of one of the Hindu men taking baptism that he was asked to convert to Christianity as he loved a Christian girl,” one activist told a reporter. “We immediately rushed to the church and stopped the conversion process.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In Pakistan, Asia Bibi, a Christian mother sentenced to death for blasphemy, is doing “well,” according to her husband. She was sentenced after drinking water from a well reserved for Muslims, and for allegedly making derogatory remarks about Mohammed. Rights groups have reported that she is so frail she can barely stand. Shahbaz Bhatti, a Christian cabinet minister who tried to defend her, was assassinated last March.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In Nigeria, a violent pseudo-Islamic sect called Boko Haram is thought to be behind a series of deadly church bombings, including one on Christmas Day. Christian-Muslim tensions are on the rise, and Christians have also massacred Muslims. In Uganda, on Christmas Eve, Islamic extremists threw acid on a church leader and partly blinded him.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, the country's leading bishop warned that Muslim fundamentalists are attacking Christians with impunity. Mobs have burned and ransacked churches, and rights groups say violence against religious minorities has escalated. This week, according to The Jakarta Globe, a hard-line Muslim group attacked church members over a bumper sticker saying, “We need a friendly Islam, not an angry Islam.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In Iraq, two-thirds of the pre-war Christian population has fled the country. Some experts predict that Christianity in that country, as well as in the lands where Jesus walked, will soon be extinct.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">You get the picture. Religious strife is on the rise, and religious persecution is a serious problem in some of the world's biggest countries. Say what you like about the Harper government's plan to launch an Office of Religious Freedom as part of its foreign policy. You can say that it's naive, or dumb, or a blatant effort to appeal to the domestic religious base. But you can't say the issue doesn't matter.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In the U.S., scholars across the political spectrum are trying to persuade the Obama administration to give the issue much higher priority. Among them is Thomas Farr, director of the Religious Freedom Project at the Berkley Center in the U.S. On his blog, he's argued that people “who think this idea is a fantasy of the Christian right, or that it represents illicit American exceptionalism, or cultural imperialism” fail to understand the connection between religious freedom and fundamental issues of justice and human dignity. Where religion still matters, promoting religious freedom is one of the most important ways to promote human freedom.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Last summer, the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life released a sobering look at the decline of religious freedoms around the world. It found that between 2006 and 2009, restrictions on religious beliefs and practices rose in 23 countries. Because some of these countries are so populous, the increases affected a much larger share of peoples and states. “More than 2.2 billion people – nearly a third of the world total population – live in countries where either government restrictions on religion or social hostilities involving religion rose substantially.” Governments in 101 countries used some measure of force against religious individuals or groups, “including individuals being killed, physically abused, imprisoned, detained or displaced from their homes, as well as damage to or destruction of personal or religious properties.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Many in the secular West like to think that religion is playing less of a role in world affairs. They couldn't be more wrong. As religion scholar Philip Jenkins warns, religious conflict and issues of minority rights will play a major role in world affairs for years to come. “The most disturbing features of contemporary Christian/Muslim conflict is how very commonplace they have become,” he writes. “The blood-shed in Nigeria and Indonesia does receive some coverage in the West, yet violence of this sort has become almost too widespread to report.” Ex-panding Christian minorities are likely to provoke violent reactions from Muslims and others who feel threatened, he says.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">If you're interested in the forces that will shape the geopolitics of this century, a serious study of religion is a good place to start.

For more than 30 years, candidates for the federal party's top job have claimed they could win support in Quebec, unite urban and rural constituencies across the country, and push the Liberals to the margins of national politics.</p>",Document GLOB000020120104e8140002a,,A13,587 words,,"<p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">What makes this campaign distinctive is the candidacy of two women MPs, Peggy Nash and Niki Ashton, for the leadership of a party that has already had two female leaders. The NDP stands out in international terms not only for Audrey McLaughlin and Alexa McDonough's successive terms at the helm between 1989 and 2003, but also for B.C. MLA Rosemary Brown's path-breaking leadership run in 1975.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Moreover, the NDP is unusual for the sustained numerical presence of women MPs, a result, in part, of internal rules that mandate the recruitment of female candidates in winnable seats. After the 2006 federal election, for instance, women constituted more than 40 per cent of NDP MPs, compared with 11 per cent of the Conservative caucus.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Even with these strides, however, we can't assume that gender barriers have disappeared in the NDP. Ms. Nash, Ms. Ashton and their supporters need to pay close attention to two problems.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">First, the federal party's weak standing after 1989 remains a powerful drag on women's upward mobility. Female candidates in 2012 need to present a compelling account of the foundational work carried out by party leaders, including Ed Broadbent, Ms. McLaughlin and Ms. McDonough, in the years before Jack Layton's 2003 election to the top post. In particular, female candidates need to acknowledge the contributions of each predecessor in a way that's both respectful and wide-eyed, in the sense that it addresses the anxiety party members feel about past electoral setbacks.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Second, Ms. Nash and Ms. Ashton must compete based on substance rather than style or tone. To date, both have focused their campaigns on matters of process rather than public policy: Ms. Nash stresses her skills as a bridge-builder who can bring together disparate elements of the party as well as the country, while Ms. Ashton says she'll practise a “new politics” – echoing a phrase that sounded considerably fresher when Kim Campbell used it in the 1993 federal Progressive Conservative leadership race.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The presence of high-profile female politicians has become so routine that these clichés risk undermining the candidates who use them. It's true that many female politicians, such as Alberta Premier Alison Redford, practise politics differently than their predecessors. Yet, they succeed not by asserting the existence of that distinctive style, but by demonstrating its impact on policy.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Ms. Nash and Ms. Ashton can draw on extensive organizational research that documents the greater willingness of female managers to transcend traditional hierarchies, and thus develop strong teams that reach decisions based on consensus rather than conflict. Framing their own backgrounds in light of this literature has the advantage of not just drawing attention to the interpersonal qualities of other candidates, but also shining a spotlight on how relevant each candidate's skill set is to present challenges facing the party.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In the realm of politics, though, leadership choices largely come down to judging which candidate offers the best chance of electoral success. For Ms. Nash and Ms. Ashton, saying they'll do politics differently is insufficient to win that race.</p>",FEMALE NDP CONTENDERS,,4 January 2012,Comment,"Offer substance, not just style",,SYLVIA BASHEVKIN   ,©2012 The Globe and Mail Inc.

Each time, the party was seen as arrogant, out of touch and out of date. Liberals bounced back by reaching out to new people with new ideas, and modernizing their organization. Renewed, the party earned its way back to governing – for 22 consecutive years the first time, 21 almost continuous years the second time, and 13 years in a row the last time.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In each generation, the party's modernization proposals were thought by some to be radical and fraught with risk. But reformers carried the day each time because they were inspired by the vision of a more open, democratic, transparent, accountable party and because Liberals had the courage to embrace change.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">This weekend, Liberals consider a series of bold proposals to bring their party into the 21st century and vault it past opponents – including a much-mooted primary-style leader selection process. But primaries make no sense unless three other “radical” proposals are adopted first:</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">1. A national riding-based fundraising appeal for a major investment in a National Call Centre to optimize the party's technology backbone in support of the party's outreach, organization and fundraising activities.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">2. A national person-to-person organizational drive to register “supporters” so Liberals can overcome their “data” deficiency, rebuild the party's relationships with the millions of Canadians who want to vote Liberal, and create a robust database of supporters from which to quickly expand membership, worker and donor lists.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">3. Widening participation in selecting the next permanent leader and the next generation of Liberal candidates beyond the paid membership to all registered party “supporters.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">These proposals, if adopted, would revolutionize democratic engagement in Canada, changing the very nature of political power and how it's exercised. But will Liberals have the courage to lead? Will they vote to open up their party, by committing to building a data-driven political communications technology platform and by offering ordinary Canadians a say in choosing the faces and voices of the next Liberal generation?</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Primaries could easily become just another gimmick.

Coming from a politician better known for wanting to raise business taxes to pay for social programs, it's a remarkably free-enterprise approach. He's earned kudos from Conservative MP Dan Albas, the Okanagan-Coquihalla MP who is pushing a private member's bill in Ottawa to change the federal law. Mr. Albas would give each province the right to set personal exemptions so that a Calgary oenophile could order a case of wine directly from an Okanagan vintner.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The current law is easily evaded by tourists who drive across the border. What B.C.'s winemakers really want is to free up online sales and make inroads into the lucrative Ontario market.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Averill Creek winemaker Andy Johnston holds the current law in contempt. “It's a joke, a farce,” he said. In defiance, his Cowichan Valley vineyard will ship wine across the country by courier, but most of the 7,000 cases he produces each year are consumed in B.C. because distribution through other provincial liquor boards – Ontario in particular – is a nightmare.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In Ottawa, Mr. Albas' proposed change has won support across party lines, but the provinces are lukewarm. “There is not one province that has indicated they think it's a great idea,” noted Miles Prodan, executive director of the B.C. Wine Institute. Ontario wants to protect its own wine industry, but all the provinces are concerned about loss of revenues if wineries can sidestep provincial liquor control boards.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">B.C. Premier Christy Clark has applauded Mr. Albas' efforts, and has pledged to work with the other provinces to open new domestic markets to B.C. wines. But it is hard to see where Ms. Clark has taken action. There's no indication she raised it at any of her meetings with other premiers to date, and she is not expected to bring it up when she hosts the premiers for a conference later this month.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Nirmal Gidda, proprietor of the Mt. Boucherie Family Estate Winery in Kelowna, can't figure out why the B.C. Liberals aren't all over this issue. He can measure the value of the wine tourism trade in the Okanagan by the Alberta licence plates that dominate his parking lot every summer. They can – and do – bring wine home with them, but being able to sell wine over the telephone or Internet would be a huge boon. “It would probably increase our revenues by 25 to 30 per cent to be able to ship to private customers in Alberta,” Mr. Gidda figures.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The Okanagan – the province's prime wine region – has reliably returned B.C. Liberals to the legislature for two decades. Mr. Gidda's nearest vineyard neighbour is Quail's Gate, owned by B.C. Liberal MLA Ben Stewart. “And yet it's hard to get any commitment from them,” Mr. Gidda said. “We need to have somebody step up to the plate.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Despite the B.C. Liberals' apparent stranglehold on the region, the NDP Leader senses an opportunity. Since winning the party leadership last spring, Mr. Dix has visited here 17 times. “They are taken for granted by the B.C. Liberals,” he said. “I'm not going to write the Okanagan off.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">By pushing Ms. Clark's government on this issue, Mr. Dix is giving the grape trade someone to cheer for.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">******</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">THE B.C. WINE INDUSTRY</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">After the great pullout of 1988 – when the B.C. government paid wine growers to haul out their low-grade vines – the winemaking industry has become the province's chief agricultural success story.

I say this because excessive argument about what's effectively a microstructure in a sizable federal department perpetuates a long-standing weakness in Canada's foreign policy debates: an intellectual obsession with “ends” (in this case, protecting religious minorities around the world) at the expense of building the strategic “means” to achieve any “ends” of consequence.</p>",Document GLOB000020120104e81400034,,A13,755 words,,"<p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Successive governments in Ottawa have all too easily subscribed to the conventional wisdom that if we as a country could only determine what our interests were, what our principles or values were, and indeed what our core international purpose was, then we could, by logic, proceed to advance a coherent and effective foreign policy agenda. All of these, of course, are concerns solely about the “ends” of our foreign policy.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Naturally, as Canada is a vast and diverse land, and as different prime ministers have different conceptions of what the country ought to do in the world, the country almost never reaches a point of general “consensus” about which “ends” are worth pursuing. And so the debate continues ad nauseam, with perhaps only isolationists totally sated by the conceptual impasse that has led us to underperform as a country on the global stage.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The core of the foreign policy and larger international affairs debate in Canada should not be about the ends we may wish to pursue as a collective, but rather about the means necessary to advance the ends legitimately chosen by any elected government. The desired ends will clearly change according to the times and government, but the means to success for Canada are stable and undifferentiated, and they need to be built up.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Without this reversal of strategic logic (means before ends, rather than ends dictating means), we Canadians are left talking to ourselves about problems in the world we're interested in but typically incapable of solving – for lack of the requisite means to do so.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">One is reminded of the 2007 speech by Prime Minister Stephen Harper about Canada's intending to become a leader in the Americas (a perfectly legitimate “end” goal for a wealthy, reputable country such as Canada). Some years from now, historians in Latin America may wonder just how Canada planned to achieve its stated end of regional leadership. Answer: With no Spanish speakers! Or Portuguese speakers, for that matter. (By the time Australia had determined it wished to be a player in Asia, future prime minister Kevin Rudd – then chief of staff to the premier of Queensland – had already convinced the federal and state governments that the country needed a national Asian languages strategy.)</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">So what's the nature of the “means” debate that Canada needs to have to be a major (and credible) global player this century? Two interrelated “means” levers need to be addressed: national culture and national capabilities. A country that's serious about advancing ambitious ends in the world – defending minority religions or, say, brokering peace and transforming impoverished countries, or even fighting a just war – requires a public culture that can properly assess happenings beyond North America, and can support sustained engagement by Canada beyond our borders. More concretely, it needs the practical capabilities to advance these ends: talent (in key positions), assets (intelligence, military, diplomatic), money and, to be sure, differentiated relationships with players in the world.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">To be a leader not only in the Americas but also in the world, Canada needs more foreign affairs culture, and certainly more capabilities. We might start by creating that army of Spanish and Portuguese speakers that the federal government surely requires to advance its stated ends. Let's add some Mandarin and Arabic speakers for good measure.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">None of this is possible without a brave political leadership that applies pressure over time to build the culture and capabilities today that will allow us to score major foreign policy achievements in the long term. But we can be confident that transformation of the Canadian means to regularly realize great projects in the world will make small potatoes of the current argument over the Office of Religious Freedom.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Irvin Studin is program director and assistant professor in the School of Public Policy and Governance at the University of Toronto.</p>",FOREIGN POLICY,,4 January 2012,Comment,Here's how Canada can be a global player,,IRVIN STUDIN   ,©2012 The Globe and Mail Inc.

Early work is beginning on the air-rail link between Pearson airport and Union Station, which will give Toronto something that other leading cities have had for years: a direct train route from airport to downtown and back.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">New, dedicated bus lanes are being built in York and Mississauga to speed commuters through heavy suburban traffic. Premier Dalton McGuinty has promised to bring all-day service to the GO train system. The <span class=""companylink"">Toronto Transit Commission</span> has agreed to adopt the Presto smart card payment system, already rolling out on the GO network and suburban transit services. And work continues on the northward extension of the Spadina subway.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Most ambitious of all is the Eglinton-Scarborough Crosstown Project, a new 25-kilometre light-rail transit line that will take riders from Black Creek Drive to Scarborough city centre. A new report says the $8.2-billion line is the most expensive infrastructure project in all of Canada. In its annual report on the country's top 100 infrastructure projects, ReNew magazine pegged the Crosstown at No. 1.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Construction is already in progress. Workers are digging a giant hole near Black Creek and Eglinton. Massive boring machines will be lowered into it to begin tunnelling for the underground stretch of the line. Metrolinx, the regional transit agency, expects it to open by 2020. ReNew calls it “one of the largest public transit investments in Canadian history.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">All of this has to be encouraging for hard-pressed Toronto commuters, who have waited decades for serious expansion of the transit network. The Yonge subway line opened in 1954, the University line in 1963, the Bloor-Danforth line in 1966, the Spadina line in 1978 and the Scarborough RT in 1985. Since then, the only new line has been the five-station Sheppard “stubway” in 2002. Even as the population boomed with the arrival of hundreds of thousands of new immigrants, the transit build-out stalled.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Now, at long last, things are happening – and about time, too. Demand for transit is rising fast, with more than 500 million riders expected to take the TTC this year, a new record. The city has a chance to catch up for years of transit delay and neglect.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But given Toronto's sad history of stop-and-start transit planning, it's only reasonable to wonder whether it will all unfold just as planned. A previous attempt to build an Eglinton subway fell apart when Premier Mike Harris cancelled it to save money. Then, as now, the provincial government faced a massive budget deficit.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Big-ticket transit projects make easy targets for budget cutters. Don't forget that the McGuinty government itself delayed billions in funding for the Transit City light-rail project, later killed by Mayor Rob Ford. With credit-rating agencies breathing down its neck, will it be tempted to pull back funding for the Crosstown?</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Ford forced up the cost of the line by around $2-billion when he insisted that most of it travel underground, even the stretch along the eastern reaches of Eglinton that was supposed to go on the surface under the initial plan. For that reason, the project moved from No. 4 to No. 1 on ReNew's top 100 infrastructure list. Queen's Park bean counters may wonder whether going back to Plan A wouldn't make more sense.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Another big question mark floats over Mr. Ford's cherished Sheppard subway extension. Because all or most of the money from Transit City is now going to build the Crosstown, a provincial project, no one quite knows how Sheppard is going to be financed, if it happens at all.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">So it goes in the world of Toronto transit.

The Reformers said gold-plated MP pensions put politicians out of touch with ordinary Canadians. They did the noble thing by “opting out” of the parliamentary pension plan. But when Jean Chrétien's government gave them the opportunity to retroactively opt in after the 2000 election, the take-up was nearly unanimous.</p>",Document GLOB000020120103e8130000j,,A13,722 words,,"<p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The math was so simple that MP Ian McClelland, by then a member of the Canadian Alliance, described his dilemma this way: “To choose between being called a hypocrite and stupid, I would choose to be called a hypocrite.” Colleague Monte Solberg observed that refusing the pension was like wearing a hair shirt.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In the grand scheme of things, the $25-million taxpayers put into the MP pension plan last year is small potatoes.

Last month, the C.D. Howe Institute calculated that the federal public pension liability is $80-billion higher than government estimates. Except among public-sector devotees, it's hard to find anyone who believes that pensions for government workers are connected to economic reality.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But before MPs take on public-sector pensions, they need to look in the mirror. Some parliamentarians argue that they are in a different category than public servants because they sacrifice their best income-earning years to serve the greater good. But for many, being an MP is the best job they will ever have. For high achievers such as Jim Prentice (now vice-chairman for CIBC), it's hard to say his time in Ottawa hurt his long-term earning potential.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">What makes it all the more difficult for MPs to tackle public servants' pensions is the advantages they hold over their underlings:</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">While government workers get 2 per cent credit of earnings for each year of service, MPs get 3 per cent.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">A long-serving MP's pension tops out at 75 per cent of “best earnings,” whereas government workers get 70 per cent.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">MPs contribute 7 per cent of their salaries to pension, while government workers contribute 8.4 per cent.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">If Stephen Harper's government is looking for inspiration, it should consider what Mike Harris did in Ontario in 1996. Today, Ontario MPPs contribute 10 per cent of their income into an RRSP-style system. As the economy goes, so goes the value of the pension.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Unfortunately for Ontario taxpayers, Mr. Harris did not take the next logical step and convert all public-sector pensions into a defined-contribution RRSP system. But unlike MPPs, government workers had unions to guard their entitlements.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Perhaps the best evidence that MP and public-sector pensions are going the way of the dodo bird is what began happening on Jan. 1, right under Mr. Harper's nose. As of that date, membership in the <span class=""companylink"">Export Development Canada</span> defined-benefit pension plan has been cut off, with all new hires enrolled in a defined-contribution pension plan.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">As a financial institution, EDC is following the example set by the Royal Bank, which is also now placing new hires into a defined-contribution pension stream. The bank calls it responsible financial management, making pension costs more predictable and reflective of market reality.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Nationally, evidence indicates that membership in defined-benefit plans is in decline. But while government plans may be the last bastion, fall they will.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">By limiting pension reforms to new hires and the newly elected, Mr. Harper can gain support from those already in the system.

The measures are part of his eight-point plan to make rental housing safer. At the same time, he contended landlords need to be made aware of government-sponsored programs that could help them carry out repairs.

By that time, a large swath of the Canadian voting public, especially those under 40, will remember nothing of those tumultuous times. Outside Ontario, chances are that voters would know nothing about those years, just as Ontarians wouldn't have clear opinions about Mike Harcourt's years as premier of B.C. or Don Getty's as premier of Alberta.</p>",Document GLOB000020120114e81e0001m,,F9,687 words,,"<p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Of course, the Harper Conservatives will try to remind people of Mr. Rae's time as premier and paint it with the blackest of colours. That's how the Conservatives do politics: Tear down opposition leaders. The Conservative campaign against Mr. Rae has already begun. It will continue through the next election because, barring unexpected developments, Mr. Rae will lead the Liberals in that campaign.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Rae is the “interim” Liberal leader. In theory, the leadership race is supposed to start late next winter; in practice, it has begun with only one candidate, Mr. Rae. There is, frankly, no one else. If there were, Mr. Rae could leave.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Liberals can dream of Justin Trudeau, except he has ruled out a leadership bid. They can think of New Brunswick MP Dominic LeBlanc, who might be ready for prime time some years from now. They can ponder Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty. But the more they ponder, the more they'll realize that the last man standing will be Bob Rae.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Twice, the Liberals passed over Mr. Rae – once for Stéphane Dion, once for Michael Ignatieff. Mr. Rae was the most experienced, the best speaker, the more natural politician – yet, he lost twice.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Yes, his time as NDP premier counted against him with some Liberals, either because they couldn't forget his lacerating attacks on their party before he switched sides, or because they feared those years would be used against him to telling effect.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">There were other, deeper reasons. Mr. Rae never gave the Liberals a clear enough narrative why he wanted to be leader and where he wanted to go. He offered the party himself and his talents, and they weren't enough.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">When dealing with his time as NDP premier, Mr. Rae can't find the right narrative even now. Being a proud man, he defends those years, talking correctly about the difficulties of the recession Ontario faced, the challenges he overcame, the progress he made – although the generalized historical view is that of a buffeted and unsuccessful government. Ontarians apparently thought so. They decisively dumped the NDP at the first opportunity.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Having poured his reflections into books and speeches, Mr. Rae left the NDP. Here's where the narrative failed. In appealing to Liberals for their votes, he never explained why he and the Liberal Party could achieve objectives (other than taking power) that the NDP couldn't.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Rae never told Canadians why liberalism trumped social democracy, or why the Liberals reflected better than the NDP what he came to believe in. Now, the party desperately needs that narrative to bring at least some of those former Liberals back.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Rae can seek the leadership again as a way of personal vindication: At his age, and with his innate love of politics, it's hard to imagine him preferring a law firm to leading the Liberal Party. Politics was injected into his blood early – first at university, then as a young NDP MP. It still courses in his veins. He's a man of many interests beyond family, but one trumps all: politics.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Beleaguered Liberals could have fallen into factional infighting, as shattered parties often do. Under Mr. Rae, harmony has reigned in caucus, fundraising has picked up, media exposure has been won, and Mr. Rae has earned the highest badge of partisan honour: personal attacks from the Conservatives.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">He pledged when becoming “interim” leader not to seek the job thereafter.

The city was not in such bad financial shape after all. Mr. Ford had manufactured a crisis to justify spending cuts that were simply not needed.</p>",Document GLOB000020120114e81e0002c,,A14,609 words,,"<p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">It proved nothing of the sort. The city often finds itself with sudden windfalls at year-end when tax revenues come in higher or spending lower than expected. Because Toronto is required by law to have a balanced budget, officials are careful to make conservative projections at the start of the year, giving themselves some leeway when the bills come due. The result is often a tidy, and tempting, year-end surplus.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">For years, the city has been using part of this money to cover expenses for the year to come. It is like relying on sofa-cushion money to pay the mortgage. It is not part of the household budget and you can't count on it. It means that the city is paying its bills with unsustainable, unpredictable revenue, leaving it to begin each annual budget struggle from behind the eight ball.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">This is a sloppy, unwise practice and Mr. Ford is right to want to end it. City finance officials have been saying for years that Toronto should quit relying on windfall money to plug its annual budget gap. Using the temporary surpluses and dipping into reserves only masks the fact that, in truth, the city's spending chronically exceeds its permanent revenue. This “structural deficit” has dogged the city's books for years, making it hard to find the wherewithal to pay for critical needs.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Now, at long last, the city is moving to close that chasm. This year, instead of using its windfall to pay for current programs its income won't support, it plans to put aside the extra $154-million for future needs. A proposal from the city's executive committee, which will go to city council next week, would see the money go toward a fund for TTC capital projects like the purchase of new streetcars.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Chief financial officer Cam Weldon said this week that by preserving rather than spending the windfall, the new budget approach “takes us a long way to fiscal sustainability.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Unfortunately, if predictably, the mayor's critics are not listening. No sooner did city officials announce their new surplus numbers than city council's left erupted in outrage at the mayor. How dare he try to cut services when he had all that extra cash to pay for them? Why would he put away money for a rainy day with $154-million in hand?</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“As if it isn't a rainy day when even wading pools are deemed unaffordable,” huffed the Toronto Star, referring to the unspeakably cruel decision to close five city wading pools that are underused and in need of repair.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In truth, the Ford administration has shown itself quite willing to use new-found resources to save services that face the chop. Mr. Ford is backing a staff proposal to save threatened student-nutrition programs and community centres by dipping into an extra $8.8-million income from the property tax. But here is the difference: This money comes from permanent growth in tax assessments, not a one-time windfall.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Using that kind of ongoing income to pay for ongoing needs make sense.

It's also important that some party keep hammering away on the environment, especially climate change. So, kudos to the NDP for supporting a cap-and-trade system for Canada.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">What's not to like, however, is the old NDP bugbear: The party is much better at thinking about how to redistribute wealth than create it. Running through the party's leadership discourse is continuing skepticism about the free market, free trade and the globalized economy. About the only idea that candidates offer for wealth creation is a kind of public investment fund, or a public infrastructure fund. For those of an entrepreneurial bent in Canada or those trying to get ahead on their investments, the party offers nothing.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Instead, the candidates prefer industrial policies to freer markets, clearly distrust large businesses, whose tax rates they wish to raise sharply, and prefer something called “fair trade” to free trade, which invariably means the party winds up opposing free-trade deals. For a deeply trade-dependent economy such as Canada, that systematic hostility is utterly counterproductive – especially given the importance of diversifying Canada's excessive dependence on the U.S. market.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Latent protectionism lies deep in the NDP's soul. So does the belief that government is there not just to provide public services and to regulate private activity, but to direct private investment, inject public money into enterprises, and generally try to steer the economy with public funds, public regulations and trade protection. It's a very old recipe.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">It's not surprising that NDP candidates should take this view of the world, since some of the prominent ones (Peggy Nash and Brian Topp, for example) come from the trade union world. But that world, numerically speaking, is a dwindling one. It has also been changing, as public-sector unions become ever-more prominent within the labour movement.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Naturally, therefore, the NDP is locked into the belief that public services can only be delivered in the traditional public-sector union manner, meaning that the interests of providers, and not necessarily those of taxpayers, are at the heart of the way these public services are structured and delivered.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The NDP candidates are certainly not alone in making promises for which no money is easily available. Their campaign documents are full of such pledges, with the only revenue source apparently being a rollback of corporate tax cuts. Alas, the money recaptured from that rollback couldn't possibly finance all their commitments.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Topp moved out from the pack by proposing very big tax increases not just on corporations but on individuals being paid more than $250,000 and making money from capital gains and stock options. Mr. Topps figures his tax hikes would raise $18-billion, but his number assumes (wrongly) that people and companies wouldn't rearrange their affairs to minimize the tax hit. Nor is there any assumption these higher taxes might dampen economic activity, when it's shown that changes to tax rates, up or down, affect personal and corporate decisions.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">At least Mr. Topp has explained where he'd try to find the billions he'd require for all the new spending on public services and programs. His is the classic social democratic model, largely abandoned in Europe and in provinces where the NDP governs or has governed, but one that apparently remains dear to the hearts of some federal New Democrats.</p>",NDP LEADERSHIP RACE,,6 January 2012,Comment Column,"What to like, what to fear about the Dippers",,JEFFREY SIMPSON   ,©2012 The Globe and Mail Inc.

It's the Colton Orrs, he said, who hold the “rats” accountable for “cheap shots” – elbows to the head, hits from behind into the boards. Without Mr. Orr and his fearsome ilk on patrol, the job is left to the National Hockey League's official disciplinarian, Brendan Shanahan.

It is becoming common to see double- and triple-bunking of inmates in cells designed for one. This overcrowding limits access to already scarce rehabilitative programming and increases the incidence of institutional violence. The fastest-growing portions of the inmate population continue to be those most marginalized within our society: the mentally ill, women and aboriginals. Decades of reports have detailed our correctional systems' failure to reasonably address the needs of these offenders and limit their numbers.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Bill C-10, the Safe Streets and Communities Act, which is before the Senate, will significantly increase the prison population. The Canadian Bar Association, summarizing its testimony before the House of Commons standing committee on justice and human rights, stated that the bill “will require new prisons; mandate incarceration for minor, non-violent offences; justify poor treatment of inmates and make their reintegration into society more difficult.” These results are inconsistent with our collective concepts of fairness, compassion and equality. In addition, no evidence is provided to support the bill's objectives.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Meantime, the message from other jurisdictions that have pursued increased incarceration as a solution to safer communities is clear.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In an editorial on Dec. 6, 2010, The New York Times stated: “There is almost unanimous condemnation of California-style mass incarceration, which has led to no reduction in serious crime and has turned many inmates into habitual criminals. America's prison system is now studied largely because of its failure – the result of an expensive approach to criminal justice shaped by fear-driven ideology.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The same month, The Guardian led with a report on British Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke's efforts to restore judicial discretion in sentencing. Aiming to reverse nearly 20 years of punitive criminal justice culture, the report said, Mr. Clarke “signalled that he would sweep away aspects of the statutory sentencing framework in England and Wales that ‘unhelpfully fetters' the ability of judges to make the sentence fit the crime.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Our collective experience and decades of research tell us that increased rates of incarceration neither decrease crime nor act as a deterrent to it. Safer communities and effective crime prevention are achieved through the development of integrated systems with both the flexibility and resources required to respond to individuals in a timely fashion. As a society, we must be prepared to actively support and finance early intervention strategies for youth; a judicial process with options to ensure that incarceration is a last resort; a community mental-health system that keeps the ill out of jail; a prison service that addresses individual offenders' problems rather than acting as a human warehouse; and conditional-release programming that supports timely, safe community reintegration.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Our focus and our resources should be directed toward keeping people out of jail, not in it. The financial cost of implementing effective, integrated systems pales in comparison to the billions it costs to build and operate new prisons.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Criminal justice legislation that increases prison populations while draining resources from community programs in mental health, education, child poverty and social services makes absolutely no sense.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The fiscal and human costs of the path we are on, in pursuit of safer communities, are far too high and will not be easily reversed. Sober second thought is desperately needed.

Becoming new, as some genius once concluded, means turning away from the old. Moving the country to its final stage of independence certainly has a modernizing look.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The monarchy is hanging on in many countries, but it's hardly the way of the future. In Jamaica, the new Prime Minister, Portia Simpson Miller, has just announced that her country will complete the cycle of independence by initiating the process of becoming a republic.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In Canadian history, the cycle of independence has been authored chiefly by the Liberal Party. It was under the Liberals in 1929 that the Statute of Westminster, which eliminated much of Britain's authority to make laws for Canada, was negotiated. It was under Lester Pearson in 1965 that Canada got its own flag. It was under Pierre Trudeau in 1982 that the Constitution was patriated. It's natural that the Liberals should be the party that takes the final step.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">A decoupling from the monarchy would be popular in Quebec, the province where that institution, for obvious reasons, is least popular. The Liberals need to rebuild their old base in Quebec. The monarchy move would help.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The monarchy is most popular with older Canadians, a demographic that the Conservatives have well in hand. But if you're looking to be the party of the future, it's the younger generations to whom you must appeal. Although William and Kate were a big hit in Canada with all age groups, the monarchy is less relevant to the younger set. And it's less relevant to an increasingly multiethnic Canada.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The Liberals could use a severing of royalty ties as a gateway to something bigger – a modernization and reform of our ailing democratic system. Liberals are already talking about reducing the powers that any new leader of their party would have. Many also favour the idea of restructuring the divisions of powers in Ottawa so as to reverse the long-time trend toward one-man rule. But they've yet to come up with good ideas for the creation of a new democracy, one befitting the 21st century, one that could see them dealing with Senate reform or abolition as well.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">To speak of doing away with ties to the monarchy or any grand reform reordering the power structure is difficult from a practical standpoint, in that it would likely require a constitutional amendment supported by the provinces.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But the Liberals should at least give some consideration to the proposal being put forward by their youth wing.

Pipeline proponents would rather frame this issue around developing an Asian market for oil sands bitumen – and the allegedly nefarious U.S.-based interests who would prevent us from doing so – than have a science-based debate about the real risks associated with getting it there by this route.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">It's the peculiar Canadian paradox that we're blessed with such natural beauty and abundance that we often fail to value it. Even by our standards, however, the Great Bear is a special place. It's the only habitat in the world for the spirit bear, which is rarer than the giant panda. Humpbacks, orcas and many other species of cetaceans take advantage of this quiet cold ocean to prosper. Eagles are as plentiful as sparrows are in Canada's urban parks. And all five species of Pacific salmon are present, providing the basis for a prosperous fishery.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mercifully, the communities that have been sustained by this wondrous ecosystem don't share our undervaluing of nature. B.C.'s coastal first nations know well that Great Bear's value as a functioning ecosystem dwarfs the tantalizing but fleeting promise of short-term cash from oil revenue. And they know from history what we know from traditional science: that this meticulously interconnected ecosystem is very vulnerable to disruption.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">A toxic event can't be ruled out, even in Enbridge's own estimation. The 1,170-kilometre pipeline would divide the rain forest, crossing countless salmon rivers. At Kitimat, toxic diluted bitumen would be loaded onto supersized tankers. Each year, more than 200 would travel through narrow fjords and into some of the world's most treacherous seas.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">This isn't the first time the Great Bear has been threatened. Twenty-five years ago, it was slated to be clear-cut. But, after years of conflict, a group of unlikely allies found a solution. First nations, forestry companies, NGOs, the Harper and Campbell governments and both Canadian and U.S.-based philanthropists finally came together to create a model of ecosystem management and economic development.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">So the question of whether foreign interests can participate in the National Energy Board hearings is curious. Should we prohibit oil sands companies, the majority of which are foreign-owned and operated? It's also hypocritical, given that the industry and government has spent untold millions to lobby foreign governments, air PR campaigns in foreign markets and solicit foreign direct investment in the oil sands. The message we're sending the world is that you're free to come to Canada to exploit nature, but not to protect it.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In the interests of full disclosure, less than 2 per cent of our revenue came from the U.S. foundations that have been targeted by smear campaigns. We're proud to add that support to the larger contributions we receive from almost 150,000 like-minded Canadians. We're also proud to provide a platform for Canadians who care deeply about conserving nature. Most important, we're transparent about our sources and uses of revenue.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Ultimately, this debate is a red herring designed to distract. The Great Bear is globally significant. If this development were proposed for the Amazon or the Great Barrier Reef, people around the world would engage. These are irreplaceable sites and input from global citizens who care about nature should be welcome. This expectation ought to be second nature in an open society.</p>",NORTHERN GATEWAY / GREAT BEAR,,11 January 2012,Comment,Our ecological treasure is the issue,i02 : Forestry/Logging | i13 : Crude Oil/Natural Gas | i0 : Agriculture/Forestry | i1 : Energy,GERALD BUTTS   ,©2012 The Globe and Mail Inc.

But he should have known the comment would live on in infamy.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">It was proof that even the most tightly scripted candidate of them all can occasionally blow his lines.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">An embittered Newt Gingrich, seemingly resigned to his fate in New Hampshire but hoping for rebirth in South Carolina, threw the first stone at Mr. Romney on Tuesday. “They apparently looted the companies, left people unemployed and walked off with millions of dollars,” the former Speaker of the House of Representatives said of Mr. Romney and his Bain cohorts. “That's not traditional capitalism.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Texas Governor Rick Perry, also betting it all on the Jan. 21 South Carolina primary, accused Mr. Romney of getting “rich off failures and sticking it to someone else.” Even former Utah governor Jon Huntsman, the most measured of the candidates, could not resist laying into Mr. Romney. But he had a more immediate need. He must break through in New Hampshire to have any hope of continuing on to South Carolina.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“Governor Romney enjoys firing people. I enjoy creating jobs,” Mr. Huntsman said. “It may be that he's slightly out of touch with the economic reality playing out in America right now, and that's a dangerous place to be.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">At a rally at a metalwork factory here, Mr. Romney was forced to spend a rare press conference defending his Bain record, reiterating his assertion that the businesses in which the firm invested on his watch went on to create more than 100,000 net new jobs.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“If [voters] want President Obama and a loss of two million jobs, a decline of median income in America by 10 per cent and people looking at very difficult prospects going forward, they can choose President Obama,” he charged. “But if they want someone who understands how this economy works at the level of job creation – of businesses failing and succeeding – that's what I can bring to the table.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">That pitch may become a tougher sell as voters are exposed to attack ads put out by Mr. Romney's GOP rivals and the Obama campaign that focus on Bain's darker side.

Changing the path would mean adding an extra 65 kilometres of pipe and tens of millions of dollars to the bottom line. TransCanada decided to go direct – and cheap – and, in the process, badly miscalculated the environmental conflict its proposed route would generate. And by gambling that it could overcome any protests, TransCanada may now have lost the opportunity altogether.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">I mention this as the National Energy Board hearings into Enbridge's Northern Gateway pipeline get under way near Kitimat, B.C. The project is Canada's own Keystone, and the hostility toward it is being framed in the same grandiose terms: the biggest environmental showdown Canada has witnessed in generations.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">From the outset, concern has centred on Enbridge's plans to take the pipeline across northern B.C. to Kitimat, where gargantuan oil tankers would come to collect the Alberta crude and then take it out through the narrow Douglas Channel before hitting the open ocean and the far-off Asian markets for which the oil is primarily intended.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">This plan has conjured up images of an Exxon Valdez-scale disaster in one of B.C.'s most pristine areas. The channel adjoins the Great Bear Rainforest, a 64,000-square-kilometre stretch of wilderness considered one of the most ecologically sacred on Earth. This is why both aboriginals and environmentalists are preparing such a fierce fight to kill the project. Right now, the odds are in their favour.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Which is why, in the end, a new Gateway route may have to be found. Some believe that it already exists and that Enbridge is bracing for this possibility.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In many ways, building the pipeline so it finishes at Prince Rupert makes more sense, anyway. You already have a world-class port capable of handling large tankers. And once they're loaded, it's a shorter journey to Asia than it will be from Kitimat. And there aren't nearly the same environmental concerns.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Enbridge is obviously aware of this. But it rejected this scenario because the pipeline would have to traverse parts of the Skeena Valley, a particularly complex and technically challenging stretch of terrain. There's a high risk of avalanche throughout this area, and the spring runoffs can often be fierce, churning up river beds in dramatic fashion.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">This type of environment can be particularly troublesome for, say, a pipeline running underground.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The reason we know this is because there's already a pipeline that runs through much of this same area. It's a natural gas line that was built in 1968 and is operated by <span class=""companylink"">Pacific Northern Gas</span>.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Greg Weeres, Pacific's vice-president of operations and engineering, confirmed that the Skeena Valley is taxing mountain topography. Over the years, the gas line has been affected by avalanches and land movement created by runoffs. Access is difficult; crews have to be flown in by helicopter to do repairs.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">That said, the line has been operating for more than 40 years. And it will likely be running for another 40 and beyond that.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Given a challenge, engineers can do almost anything. Advancements in theory and design have addressed many of the problems early pipeline builders in Canada encountered. There's no question we have the minds to construct an oil pipeline to Prince Rupert that would be safe, reliable and efficient.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">It would certainly be more costly for Enbridge. But when you're talking about a project worth tens of billions in revenue, it seems like a small price to pay. I wouldn't be surprised if this is ultimately where the company ends up. But like TransCanada, it probably will have to be forced into the move.

At the party convention in April, Ms. Marois won a confidence vote with a resounding 93.1 per cent of the vote.

This resulted in the embassy's characterizing the air quality as “unhealthy” or “very unhealthy,” while Beijing reported a “blue sky day” with “good” air quality.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The Chinese government's primary concern was that it should not lose face before its people, that Chinese citizens not be given information that could be used to question the validity of the government's data.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The embassy reported on this conversation in a cable to the State Department. The cable, among the thousands made public by WikiLeaks, makes clear that, in the view of China's Foreign Ministry, the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau should be “the sole authoritative voice for making pronouncements on Beijing's air quality.” It was as though providing information to the Chinese public on the quality of the air they were breathing was somehow interference in China's internal affairs.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Well, China was right about one thing. After the public found out they had been fed misleading information that affected their health, they were confused by the conflicting information available, questioned the official data and launched a social movement, insisting that more complete information be made available.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">That movement has led to success. In November, the China Daily reported that the Ministry of Environmental Protection would solicit public opinion on revised air quality standards, “following widespread calls for the government to provide more information on pollution.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In December, The Wall Street Journal ran an article under the headline, Victory for U.S. Embassy as Beijing Chokes on ‘Heavy Fog.'

Does the minister fear that Canada's industries are under attack by Zombie Sammy Davis Jr.? Even if that is what Mr. Oliver means, Mr. Harper's is still the more paranoid suggestion.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Harper insists that international environmental groups are working together, targeting individual projects, specifically to undermine our national sovereignty. Which is bizarre enough because, honestly, when has the left ever reached a consensus on anything? Is nobody infiltrating these groups?</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">They do some fine work, but I wouldn't want to be the one forced to organize the United Groups of the Left Potluck. It would take 122 votes just to agree on who was going to bring the tabbouleh.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But, more strangely, Mr. Harper also wants us to trust him that these environmentalists are working hand in hand with American politicians and businesses.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Are we meant to believe that the environmental groups' massive outcry against the Keystone XL pipeline (which apparently led U.S. President Barack Obama to delay the project) was an elaborately staged ploy? That environmentalists defeated the Keystone pipeline that their secret masters wanted, because it would have brought oil to the United States, only so that later they would have the credibility to defeat the Gateway pipeline their secret masters oppose, because it threatens to take Canadian oil elsewhere?</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">That seems unlikely.

And then they had a moment, and then they had a fight, and then eventually they had sex on the desk and the Canadian lobbyists walked in on them in the middle of it, which was kind of hilarious, and you guessed it – yes, it's worse than we imagined: This whole thing is just another crappy American romcom.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">They fell in love, American Big Oil and the Environmental Movement, and apparently they've decided that, as different as they are, they both really hate Canada.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">That's right, Canada. They hate the “Canadian families” that Joe Oliver has vowed to protect – all those families sitting on shovel-ready oil wells in their backyards, under the skating rink that dad makes every winter – families being prevented from realizing their dream by the entire cast of the Gillette Cavalcade of Stars, who now eat brains because they were brought back to life by the unlikely pairing of American Big Oil and the Environmental Movement.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Help us, Mr. Oliver!

The line is long, and stretches through the centuries. I know this thanks to a new book, Louise Foxcroft's Calories &amp; Corsets: A History of Dieting Over 2,000 Years, which reveals that our obsession with slimness, and our demonization of fat, has an impressive history. There is no better time to read it than in this month of wretched self-loathing.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">As long as people have looked down at their muffin tops (or their suet crusts) and winced, slimming gurus have lined up to profit from the shame. The first diet bestseller was published in the 15th century, writes Ms. Foxcroft, a British historian of medicine. Three centuries later, the noted gourmet Brillat-Savarin was an early proponent of the low-carb diet, a bit like a Reign of Terror Dr. Atkins. Lose weight, he advised, or “become ugly, and thick, and asthmatic, and finally die in your own melted grease: I shall be there to watch it.” I doubt Weight Watchers will be adopting that slogan any time soon.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Dieting, over the years, has been sold as a moral imperative, a patriotic duty, a Christian obligation. In the mid-20th century you could turn to Pray Your Weight Away or Devotions for Dieters, which included this desperate plea to the Almighty to save a sinner from pie: “I promise not to sit and stuff/But stop when I have had enough. Amen.” It wasn't just that you hated your chunky thighs; God was repulsed, too.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Ms. Foxcroft is very canny about the way health concerns are used to disguise what is essentially an aesthetic distaste for chubbiness. Fat has long been seen as a moral and intellectual failing: “The stupid, heavy, non-intellectual person, or the idiot, is generally fat and flabby,” wrote one 19th-century English doctor.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Not much has changed, even if we now put pillows around our language to guard against offence. “No one wants to be fat,” Tara Parker-Pope wrote recently in a fascinating and much-discussed article in The <span class=""companylink"">New York Times Magazine</span>. “In most modern cultures, to be fat … is to be perceived as weak-willed and lazy.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">At the centre of her piece, The Fat Trap, is a paradox: Dieters, including Ms. Parker-Pope, actually work incredibly hard at losing weight. I doubt the physicists at CERN pay as much attention to numbers as the successful dieters she interviews, who weigh every gram of food that goes into their mouths and calculate every calorie burned on their bikes. But maintaining your new slim figure, as science shows, is very difficult and most people regain their spare tires, unless they're willing to devote every waking moment to banishing thoughts of doughnuts. Losing weight, which is supposed to liberate, instead becomes a prison.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In America alone, the diet industry is worth $40-billion, slightly more than the GDP of Costa Rica. Every person who fails at a diet and embarks on another fattens the pocket of whoever is selling some chimerical notion of beauty. To what end, you have to wonder. For centuries, people in the West have been trying to lose weight – not for reasons of health, but for reasons of status – and it's a losing battle. Maybe it's time to refashion the RyKrisp slogan, and spell it out in chocolate chips: “Nobody loves a fat girl … except herself.”</p>",THE WEEK,,7 January 2012,Column,It's time to shed the tyranny of dieting – losing weight is a losing battle,,ELIZABETH RENZETTI   ,©2012 The Globe and Mail Inc.

Mr. Paul and Mr. Santorum got 19 each.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">With Iowa behind him, Mr. Romney must still work to close the enthusiasm gap that has dogged his candidacy, as grassroots Republicans question his authenticity.

I've heard diplomatic and military officials of very high rank tell me they don't really know how Canada became embroiled. Al-Qaeda had already been banished from Afghanistan by the time we entered the south. Our soldiers were professional, extremely courageous, calmly civilized and never quite sure what had caused them to be there.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">We now have some surprising answers. Analysts with London's Royal United Services Institute, a security think tank, gained un-precedented access to the confidential documents and British official records of the decision by NATO members in 2003 and 2004 to expand the Afghan war. Matthew Willis analyzed the Canadian decision, which was deeply entwined with Britain's. His paper, to be released this month, describes a secret decision by senior Armed Forces officials, without the knowledge of NATO or likely of Canada's prime minister.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“The Canadians and the British,” a senior NATO official told Mr. Willis, “hammered out the whole thing without NATO's assistance, behind closed doors. … We were not aware of the details.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">While Canada was ostensibly fighting with the 42-nation NATO International Stability and Assistance Force, the decision to establish a base in Kandahar, the most dangerous province, was negotiated in London without the knowledge – and against the advice – of the Brussels-based military alliance. NATO had been pressuring General Raymond Henault, then head of the Canadian Forces, to set up a mission in Chaghcharan or Herat.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But Canada's military officials had other ideas – and most were rooted in their experience in Bosnia, five years earlier. They had come to dislike “partnering with the Italians or certain other European nations,” Mr. Willis writes.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The generals also felt that the Bosnia and Kosovo missions hadn't won Canada much international recognition. Those had been real coalitions, and Canada had blended into the background.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“The reason went well beyond a Canadian desire to be patted on the back,” Mr. Willis writes, citing interviews with Canada's military leaders. “It was about being able to make one's voice heard in the political and military fora where mission-defining decisions were being taken, including, not least, plans for the use of Canadian soldiers. It was thus also about improving Canada's ability to exert its influence in accordance with its interests and values.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Prime minister Paul Martin must have known that Canada's troop commitment, just shy of 3,000, was the most it could muster, and may not have been enough for Kandahar. But the generals pressed ahead. Part of it, they told Mr. Willis, was a desire to please Washington.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">He raises the “contentious question why the senior Canadian military leadership, and the defence and foreign affairs departments, persisted in pushing the mission forward. Ostensibly, the military was seeking redemption after a decade of unremarkable performances in unremarkable (read: peacekeeping) theatres; or perhaps it wanted to show the U.S., the Canadian public and other key allies that it really could do combat if called on.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“Implicit and sometimes explicit in all of the above,” he concludes, “is the idea that Canadian planners were pursuing a principally national agenda divorced from the NATO plan and heavily conditioned by beliefs about what would go over well in Washington.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">It is discomforting to think that this war was prolonged beyond the ouster of al-Qaeda in order to further interests of organizational pride and stature. But it was a big part of the decision.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">This may well be the reality of modern war, as we saw in Libya, where a handful of countries forged an ad hoc alliance in confidential meetings far outside of NATO's vision and without all its members – a cafeteria NATO, if you will.

In 2010, long after Mr. McGuinty's Liberals had charged ahead anyway, Malcolm Gladwell used a keynote speech at their policy conference to call the investment a “ludicrous” waste of money. Now, previewing his government-commissioned report on public-service reform, economist Don Drummond has said there “isn't really solid evidence” that it's had value.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">For all that, the Liberals continue to insist that it was the right policy. The argument they make, which is more about intangibles than hard evidence, is quite reasonable. But its backward-looking nature suggests that Mr. Drummond might have a point about the need to reconsider class sizes as the deficit-plagued government embarks on a sweeping cost-cutting exercise.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">When Mr. McGuinty took office in 2003, they argue, the turmoil of the Mike Harris era had left a toxic atmosphere in schools. Teachers, feeling undervalued, were miserable. As a result, students were under-served. A growing number of parents were considering putting their kids into private schools.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The Liberals felt they needed a big gesture to restore faith in the system. And smaller class sizes, popular with teachers and easy for everyone else to grasp, fit the bill. So many hundreds of millions of dollars later, having hired thousands of additional teachers and renovated thousands of classrooms, the government now boasts that in the lowest grades about 90 per cent of classes have 20 students or fewer.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">At the time of implementation, insiders recall, then-education minister Gerard Kennedy assured skeptics within the education sector that it would be worth investing in some goodwill, so the government would be able to get buy-in for less flashy reforms. And in that regard, the strategy seems to have borne results.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Schools are certainly happier places than they were back then. And that broader reform agenda, which among other things involves intervention by teachers to prevent struggling students from slipping through the cracks, has received international recognition for its role in better outcomes for students – including higher standardized test scores and a lower high-school drop-out rate.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But if smaller classes were really just about setting the right conditions, that leads to an obvious question: Is it time to declare mission accomplished, and move on a little?</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">No provincial government could have a better relationship with teachers than Mr. McGuinty's. It's been symbiotic; in return for generous workplace rules and wage increases, teachers have helped the Liberals meet both their policy and political goals, including helping during election campaigns. And understandably, the Liberals are less than eager to jeopardize that.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But if all that goodwill is real, then there should be some willingness to accept that the province's current financial challenges – a $16-billion deficit and slow economic growth and potential credit-rating downgrades – require some sacrifice. And it should at least be possible to consider, if not a return to Harris-era class sizes, whether caps and targets could safely be raised a little from where they are now.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Of course, there's another reason why Mr. Drummond's advice about class sizes – like that of others before him – is likely to be rejected.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">That argument about buying goodwill is the only one that's been made in private. Publicly, the Liberals have been much less nuanced, holding up class sizes as the main cause of students' improved results. It wasn't just presented as a means to an end; it was their signature education policy, helping them get elected and re-elected.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Having gone down that route, it would be very difficult politically to concede that it might not be quite so essential a policy after all. In retrospect, had the Liberals known the financial crunch to come, perhaps they would've been less eager to stake their reputations to a largely symbolic gesture.</p>",EDUCATION,,9 January 2012,Column,Time for McGuinty to reconsider class sizes,,ADAM RADWANSKI   ,©2012 The Globe and Mail Inc.

And a game of international energy politics is afoot in Canada's West.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">These deals are different because Canadians will see how Chinese firms operate, not just invest. They're state-controlled companies, with executives such as Mr. Jiang who have moved among the Communist Party, government and big oil.

They're about to be Canadian employers, and may eventually be important ones.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">It's also a step in a strategy that's not complete.

The public image of China and Chinese companies will matter.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">What does China want? There's no pipeline to the West Coast, so Alberta bitumen can't be shipped to China, yet. In part, Chinese companies are making a financial investment.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But China is also obsessed with energy security. It sees meeting the rapidly rising energy demands of its industry as key to sustaining its economic growth.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">China wants technology to help extract their own hard-to-reach resources, especially natural gas. But it also wants diverse imports as protection against disruptions in supply from conflict or politics. It's building pipelines, in part to ensure that less of its supply comes through the narrow Strait of Malacca, which, in theory, could be choked off by conflict or even piracy.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">And resource investments around the world indicate China doesn't want to rely on buying products on the markets. It wants to own. The Chinese companies expect there will eventually be pipelines to the West Coast that will allow shipments across the Pacific.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">That's where the oil sands is wedged between superpowers. The United States also worries about energy security. It viewed the oil sands as captive supply, because the direction of the pipelines makes it the only export destination now. A West Coast pipeline would make that uncertain.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">It's still years away: hearings on the proposed Northern Gateway oil pipeline to the B.C.

There are just schools on reserves run by band councils. Many of those isolated schools are staffed by inexperienced teachers, who are often paid less than those who teach in public schools. They work in inadequate buildings that have no computers or libraries, but plenty of mould. They teach children who desperately need above-average, not grossly below-average, support.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“In time, some will be lost to themselves, to their families and communities, and to this country,” the report concludes.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Many chiefs, especially younger ones just arriving on the scene, recognize that ending generations of poverty, ill health and joblessness on reserves begins with properly educating this generation of students.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In Nova Scotia, British Columbia and elsewhere, reserves are banding together to create native school boards that, with the help of provincial governments, pool resources, set standards and adopt a common curriculum that teaches native language and culture along with math, science and language arts. While fewer than half of native students on reserves graduate from high school nationally, the figure for Mi'kmaw students in Nova Scotia – most of whom attend a combination of reserve and provincial schools – is over 70 per cent.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The Senate report proposes building on that model with legislation that would encourage – but not compel – native leaders across the country to co-operate in establishing school boards and even the native equivalent of education ministries, with federal education funding flowing through the new authorities.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Another report, jointly commissioned by the Assembly of First Nations and the government, from a panel chaired by YMCA president Scott Haldane, is expected to provide specifics on how a national program to create native school boards might work.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">That report arrives in early February, not long after Prime Minister Stephen Harper meets with native chiefs in Ottawa to discuss education and other matters.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The thinking is that the summit, the two reports and the growing co-operation between the chiefs and the Conservatives – on the education issue, if nothing else – could provide sufficient impetus for a First Nations Education Act that most chiefs would support. If all goes well, Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Duncan could present the bill to the House during the fall session.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Money, of course, will be the key. For 15 years, first nations education funding has grown at a rate of 2 per cent annually, far below the increases for provincial schools. Mr. Harper has let it be known that he is willing to put money into a first-nations education system that is effective and accountable, which is why the Tories are attracted to the idea of school boards.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">None of this will be easy. This country has a horrible history of using education to undermine native culture, so we should expect a lot of resistance to any education act, even if some chiefs do endorse it.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Still, the Conservatives have gone much farther down this path than anyone would have predicted.

The Liberal Party of Canada is right when it says it needs “radical change.” Today's Liberals are essentially the party of Toronto's Annex class, and not much else. Unless they can resuscitate themselves, the Conservatives will run Canada until the seas run dry. (The NDP will never run Canada. Trust me on this.)</p>",Document GLOB000020120112e81c0002j,,A13,750 words,,"<p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Sadly, radical change is not in sight – not this weekend, as the party's tattered remnants gather in Ottawa to map out their Road to Renewal – and not any time soon. No party that's ready to elect Sheila Copps as president is sincerely interested in renewal.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Then there's the matter of what they stand for. “The Liberals have shown they're only capable of coming up with old ideas, tired ideas and bad ideas,” says a cynical friend, and on the evidence, he's right. As the Western world is buffeted by economic storms, rising inequality and unsustainable entitlements, the Liberals are preparing to debate such urgent matters as legalizing marijuana, bringing back the Wheat Board, expanding hate-propaganda laws to include gender hatred, and abolishing the monarchy (a task that's almost constitutionally impossible).</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">These ideas – so slight, so silly and so distracting – are a sign of intellectual exhaustion. Even Liberals know that, if they want to reconnect with the “soul” of Canada, as one party stalwart put it, they'll have to come up with something better.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But maybe you can't blame them too much. The progressive left is floundering everywhere. Their best ideas are used up. The postwar institutions they worked so successfully to build are in big trouble. And they have no idea what to do about it.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">As Francis Fukuyama writes in a powerful new essay, The Future of History, “it has been several decades since anyone on the left has been able to articulate, first, a coherent analysis of what happens to the structure of advanced societies as they undergo economic change and, second, a realistic agenda that has any hope of protecting a middle-class society.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The liberal democracies are at the end of the welfare-state road, and all of them are looking for a map. Their aging demographics mean that entitlement spending is exploding just as economic growth has slowed dramatically. Raising taxes on the rich won't solve this problem.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Meantime, our barnacle-encrusted public institutions have shown they are too expensive, too unresponsive, too inflexible and too captive to their own interest groups to deliver services in effective and efficient ways. Both health care and public education are weighed down by excessive bureaucracy, lack of competition and rule-bound work practices that belong to the age of the medieval guilds.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Fixing the public sector will be among the top priorities of governments for the next generation. But as Mr. Fukuyama points out, the mainstream left remains obsessed with defending the status quo. “Thus, when existing social democratic parties come to power, they no longer aspire to be more than custodians of a welfare state that was created decades ago.” The Liberals also need to stop assuming that most Canadians trust and respect the wisdom of government as much as they do. Hint: They don't.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The trouble with the Liberals is, they know what they're against (anything attached to Stephen Harper) but have no idea what they're for. Although the age of ever-expanding entitlements is at an end, they can't help themselves from thinking up some more. The worst part is that, despite their accusations that Mr. Harper is a dangerous right-wing radical, on most substantive matters (such as fiscal policy, immigration policy and free trade), they basically agree.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The deeper question posed by Mr. Fukuyama is whether liberal democracy can survive the decline of the middle class. Hardly anyone predicted that technology and globalization would have such dramatically disparate effects – enriching some people, dislocating so many others. It's these factors, rather than Wall Street robber-bankers, that are driving the growth in inequality.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">How might society mitigate these flaws in capitalism in ways that are politically acceptable? Perhaps the Liberals could get around to thinking about this one of these days. I'd like them to prove my cynical friend wrong. I'd like the Tories not to be the only game in town.</p>",CANADIAN POLITICS,,12 January 2012,Comment Column,"Let's face it, the Liberals are out of gas",,MARGARET WENTE   ,©2012 The Globe and Mail Inc.

Mr. Kim and Mr. Havel were dramatic contrasts in style of governance, liberality of mind and openness to new thinking, but they can also serve as case studies of the myopic and deadening education of the technocrat as opposed to the expansive and liberating education of the playwright-essayist.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Admittedly, being a technocrat is not a bad thing; the governments of Greece and Italy have replaced their respective prime ministers, George Papandreou and Silvio Berlusconi, with technocrats Lucas Papademos and Mario Monti. But the latter are economists and not party functionaries like Mr. Kim, who was adept enough to charm former U.S. secretary of state Madeleine Albright and others with a self-deprecating manner and a familiarity with pop culture, all the while remaining a dangerous political fantasist.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">A liberal arts education is not an automatic guarantor of an emancipated intellect or an enlightened sensibility. You have to work at it. In fact, Mr. Havel was prevented from studying the humanities at university for political reasons, an early indicator for him that the authorities appreciated the subversive potential of such an education. But the capacity of a writer and political thinker like Mr. Havel to usher in a new and bloodless era by symbolizing the conscience of freedom-enamoured Czechs would be unthinkable were it not for his exposure to a tradition of learning that is not subservient to a prevailing political ideology, that is deeply humanist in its core, steeped in the writings of extraterritorial thinkers not held hostage to the orthodoxy of the moment.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">North Korea's Dear Leader may have been an obsessive devotee of Hollywood B movies, thereby giving him a mite of aesthetic relief from the grey madness of Pyongyang, but Mr. Havel brought down an oppressive system through his art and witness.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">So, when next a young sociology undergraduate is critiqued in the manner of Peter Shaffer's Austrian emperor in Amadeus, who observes to a puzzled Mozart that his just-debuted work has “too many notes,” the student might respond that there are as many sociologists as it takes to keep us free.</p>",LIBERAL ARTS EDUCATION,,2 January 2012,Comment,Too many sociologists?

Liberals, by contrast, have few principles beyond survival and power, which at least makes for a keen attention to the public good.</p>",Document GLOB000020120106e8160001g,,A13,618 words,,"<p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">A significant part of the Liberal future will be decided at the convention. This has nothing to do with policy. These proposals are the usual mix of motherhood and political correctness (save a call for legalized marijuana), tax-and-spend big government, and a country run out of Ottawa. No, the big question, going to the survival of the party, is a constitutional one: How will the next leader be chosen?</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Why should this matter? Because the party establishment proposal is for a new system looking a whole lot like the American primaries that crowd our TV screens these days.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">To get a feel for it, one need only look south. Just about anyone could sign up, for free and at the last minute, to get a vote for the new Liberal leader. Regional primaries would be held over a period of weeks (as in the U.S., even culminating in a Super Saturday) to generate a sense of drama and regional identity.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">National Liberal president Alfred Apps says this would “reconnect Liberalism with millions of disaffected and disengaged Canadians,” and be an opportunity for more unknown candidates.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Well, maybe. It's a nice dream. But it's not without its shadows. One need only look at the current Republican primary circus to see some of them.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">An obvious problem is that this system calls for the party leader to be chosen mostly by those who know very little about the person. And one need not believe that these newbies would linger to help the new person. The party is famous for the thousands of “instant Liberals” who show up to support this or that ethnic or religious candidate, never to be seen again.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">A second worrying possibility is turnout. A maxim of politics is that one books a smaller hall for a meeting than the numbers expected to give a sense of crowd and excitement. But this primary “hall” is in the millions. What if no one showed up or cared enough about the leadership to take part? Or what if mainly special interests showed up?</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">There's also the matter of knowledge. Proper assessment of candidates takes time and experience. Indeed, that's why we've had political parties until now.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">And forgive a political science thing: The primary process would bring a party leader even closer to the stature of the U.S. president, beholden only to the people (which means to no one) and not to the party, a potential prime minister all-powerful. At least the president has to deal with Congress rather than a supine parliamentary majority.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">I think the Liberals would be better off looking at Resolution 18 submitted by the Ontario Liberal Party. This calls for a Renewal Commission (like the Reform Commission of 1985) that would take a thoughtful look at this primary concept and other ideas. This is too important for the precipitous action now proposed.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">There's no hurry on this. The next election will not be until 2015. Study the possibilities (including the old, delegated convention) throughout 2012, adopt a system in 2013, choose a leader in 2014 and go into the election with momentum. Makes more sense.</p>",LIBERAL CONVENTION,,6 January 2012,Comment,Primaries aren't the way to go,,GORDON GIBSON   ,©2012 The Globe and Mail Inc.

The site matches then and now photographs taken at the exact same location.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Launched on Christmas Day, the blog – at changingvancouver.wordpress.com – already has more than 50 entries complete with historical background and information on architects and builders.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">It is an irresistible time waster.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The blog is produced by Andy Coupland, a London-born city hall planner, and John Atkin, the historian and heritage advocate.

It stands on ground once occupied by the many-gabled Manor House Hotel, which boasted a wraparound porch on all three levels, as well as a bell tower overlooking the intersection. The Manor House was designed by William Blackmore, a British-born architect who skipped debts in Winnipeg and Minneapolis to set up practice in Vancouver a year after the city was founded.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">One of the blog's most shocking contrasts is the pairing of today's parking garage with yesterday's modest shops at the corner of Granville and Cordova.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“That single storey is so much more interesting than the parking garage,” Mr. Coupland said. “It's interesting how busy that corner used to be, and how dead it is now.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In that one block, now relegated to memory, can be told the story of a city.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Along Granville Street could be found a lunch counter and an office of the Railway Express Agency, which shipped parcels. There was also a barber shop operated by James Willows; the Wigwam novelty store offering native crafts and Japanese porcelain; and a furrier. The corner was occupied by Wilson's, described as the Post Office News Stand in the city directory.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">A star-shaped neon sign advertised the Star Weekly magazine, while other exterior signs promoted <span class=""companylink"">Coca-Cola</span> and Sweet Caporal cigarettes. The newsstand is open to both Granville and Cordova Streets, attracting customers from the train station (now Waterfront Station) and the post office (now Sinclair Centre).</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The adjacent fur store was founded by the Lando family. Lou and Sara Lando's son, Esmond (Bud) Lando became a prominent lawyer and sportsman in the city, while his wife, Edith, was named to the Order of Canada as a “quintessential volunteer.” Their children are known for their own volunteer and philanthropic work. One of them, Barry Lando, worked for a quarter-century as a producer on CBS's 60 Minutes.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">All of which is more interesting than a parking garage.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">While the blog has so far used archival photos, Mr. Atkin is dipping into his extensive collection of private, never-before-seen photos dating from more recent decades.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Among these is a 1962 shot of the Courtesy Kitchen, serving Chinese and Canadian food, at the corner of East Broadway and Scotia.

Previewing his coming report, Don Drummond publicly pronounced that economic growth had permanently stagnated under Mr. McGuinty's watch, meaning the province's entire model of program spending was no longer sustainable. And by the way, some of the Premier's proudest investments – smaller class sizes, for instance – were poor value and should be reversed.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But on Thursday, Mr. McGuinty and his advisers were sanguine.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">They were evidently prepared for the stories that ran that morning in The Globe and Mail and the Toronto Star, likely because they were in the loop about Mr. Drummond giving interviews. And they seemed perfectly happy for the Premier to spend his first public event of the year talking about the economist's broadsides.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">To understand why that is, it helps to bear in mind that – from the perspective of Mr. McGuinty and his Finance Minister, Dwight Duncan – Mr. Drummond's commission on public-service reform is increasingly being viewed as an exercise in table-setting.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The government might have hoped, when it struck the commission last spring, that answers to get out of deficit would be provided. But while it still might find considerable value in many of the report's roughly 400 recommendations, the report is unlikely to be the blueprint for the next provincial budget. Instead, the Liberals are clearly hoping that Mr. Drummond's doom-and-gloom will provide political cover for their own, somewhat milder austerity plan.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The Liberals probably won't commit to getting annual spending increases in health care below 3 per cent, as Mr. Drummond has proposed; they certainly won't scrap their own signature education policies. If they reject Mr. Drummond's unusually pessimistic forecast of 2-per-cent economic growth in perpetuity, and bring in some additional revenues by cancelling planned corporate tax cuts, they should generally be able to promise fewer cutbacks than the ones Mr. Drummond will call for.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But with a $16-billion deficit, and credit agencies threatening downgrades, whatever the government comes up with still won't be an easy sell.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Not to the workers in the broader public-sector – doctors and teachers among them – whose contracts will be up for negotiation this year. Not to the general public, which was hardly well-served by a recent election campaign in which all three provincial parties glossed over the leaner times ahead. And not to many Liberals themselves, including some of the ones around the cabinet table, who hardly got into public life because they were looking to cut things.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Those realities will be a little harder to deny now that Mr. Drummond is using his commission's platform to more or less pronounce that the province is in crisis.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Meanwhile, Mr. McGuinty will be able to point to Mr. Drummond's proposals as he tries to make his own more palatable. Where the economist has recommended what the Liberals planned to do anyway, his report will provide justification. And his more draconian ideas will be pointed to as grim inevitabilities if the Liberals' alternatives aren't adopted.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Of course, Mr. McGuinty's decision to appoint the commission could still blow up in his face. If Ontarians look closely at what Mr. Drummond has to say – at his implicit (and in some cases direct) criticism of the Liberals' record – they might reconsider the steady-hand pitch that helped the Premier get re-elected this past fall.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But Mr. McGuinty is making the best of a bad situation.

You can count 20 or 30 workers in a single gang, showing why this kind of shovel-ready work became such a favourite of governments. In the beginning, at any rate, paving roads employed a lot of people.</p>",Document GLOB000020120102e81200008,,A11,769 words,,"<p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Canada now has something approaching 900,000 kilometres of paved roads, the United States 6.4 million kilometres – taken together, a vast expanse of heat-absorbing surfaces. Yes, road building has changed. Work crews are smaller, paving machines bigger; and highways are faster and safer than ever. But highways fill essentially the same single, simple function they filled a hundred years ago – roads without bumps.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">This could soon change. This year, U.S. inventor Scott Brusaw will build a small prototype of the world's first solar-powered, electronically controlled, glass-surfaced highway on a parking lot near his lab in the small community of Sagle, Idaho.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The U.S. government will fund the experiment, which will cost a mere $750,000 – less than the cost of paving one kilometre of road. Mr. Brusaw, an electrical engineer, will seek to demonstrate that his smart solar road panels have the capacity to convert the U.S. highway system (and, by extension, Canada's) into a huge power generator theoretically capable of producing three times as much electricity as the U.S. now consumes – and almost as much as the entire world now consumes. By Mr. Brusaw's calculations, this highway-based power generator would produce so much electricity that highways could be heated, all winter long, to 40 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Could solar-powered highways really mean an end to snowplows and icy roads? Mr. Brusaw says they could. He cites the rear window in cars: A glass plate is embedded with a heating element that can “crank up to 85 degrees Fahrenheit” to clear the window of snow or ice. His solar-heated highway would be permanently heating (during winter months) at 40 degrees Fahrenheit. meaning snow wouldn't accumulate in the first place.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Brusaw's solar panels measure 12 feet by 36 feet. Mimicking the rear window in a car, the surface level is made of translucent glass, textured for traction. (Glass is 75-per-cent sand, a common enough raw material.) Beneath the surface are heating elements and an array of LEDs, light devices that move electronic data and activate sensors. At the bottom of the panel, a “base plate” distributes power as required – to the road-surface information systems, to the pavement-warming systems and to transfer of surplus electricity energy storage tanks and to the continental grid.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">For the motorist, the sensor devices inside the glass panel would “paint” illuminated lane-passing lines to guide traffic and would “print” warning messages – stop, slow down – on the roadway ahead as conditions required. The messages would be calculated and confirmed every 12 feet of distance travelled. This isn't as improbable as it sounds. IBM has already shown the use of roadway sensors to deliver road-condition reports.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Based on an assumption of only four hours of sunlight a day, and only 15 per cent efficiency in the capture of solar energy, Mr. Brusaw says a continental installation of smart roadway panels would generate enough electricity to power the U.S. 24 hours a day. Much of the country's highway system is massed on the East Coast and the West Coast. Thus the “lit” (day) portion of the continent would generate enough excess electricity to power the “dark” (night) part.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Brusaw's vision is intriguing. The technical credibility of the concept itself has been demonstrated. The 2012 prototype will assess the economics of “commercializing” it. Mr. Brusaw thinks a solar-powered kilometre of highway could pay for itself in six years – but, deeply in debt, governments can't afford the up-front investment. Governments will need to take highways private – or quasi-private – to produce super-smart, solar-powered roadways. The real barrier, after all, is neither scientific nor financial. It's institutional – and, lamentably, ideological.</p>",TECHNOLOGY,,2 January 2012,Comment Column,No more snowplows or icy roads?

Eventually, you subside.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">These objections miss the point. Worse, they actually make the point – in favour of the office's establishment. Yes, religion has not only been oppressive in the past but, in many places in the world, still is.

The second confirms the appropriateness of a country such as Canada undertaking it. A beacon of religious freedom itself, it thereby expresses its concern that other countries share this blessing.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">There's a lot of careless invocation these days of “separation of church and state.” This isn't a Canadian doctrine, and is only very dubiously an American one. (In recent years, U.S. courts and scholars have offered a more nuanced view of permissible co-operation between the state and faith-based organizations to achieve legitimate secular ends such as education and social welfare.) Even if you adopt this term as your mantra, however, it doesn't preclude a public stand on behalf of religious freedom. On the contrary, it implies one.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Religious freedom is precisely what the secular state was invented to secure. To the great philosopher John Locke (1632-1704) and the Enlightenment thinkers who followed him, religion could be free of coercion by the state only if the state was freed of coercion by religion. Instead of there being an official or established church whose bidding the state was obliged to do by suppressing or otherwise disadvantaging rival churches, religion would be disestablished. The state would go its way, and the churches theirs. Never again would any church get the state to do its dirty work.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But nor would any church be permitted to recruit anyone else to its dirty work, either. There remained one crucial function for the state to perform within the realm of religion. In undertaking it, however, it acted in its secular capacity rather than in a religious one. That task was precisely to enforce freedom of religion.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Freedom of religion is not religion itself, and to promote it is not to support religion (even if, on balance, religion benefits from its promotion). For freedom of religion, banishing all coercion from the religious realm inevitably entails the freedom not to be religious. The church of one's choice at which one worships can be no church at all. And if one does choose to worship at a church, it can only be at a tolerant one, one that has laid its arrogance aside and recognized the right of all human beings to worship at any church or none.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Freedom of religion is not itself religious; rather, it reflects the modern decision to put and keep religion in its proper place. It's best conceived not as sui generis but as one of the larger basket of personal freedoms, protection of which defines the core of liberal democracy.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">So, far from contradicting Canada's commitment to secularism and tolerance, the creation of an Office of Religious Freedom will affirm it. Its goal will be the promotion not of religion as such but of respect for the rights of the individual in matters of religion. Its task will be to press illiberal regimes to treat religious dissenters more liberally. This will doubtless prove an uphill struggle, for, historically, freedom of religion has flourished only with other liberal freedoms.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Yes, there are many pitfalls here, but the impropriety of the very notion of an Office of Religious Freedom isn't one of them.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Clifford Orwin is a professor of</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">political science at the University</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">of Toronto and a distinguished</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">fellow at Stanford University's</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Hoover Institution.</p>",OFFICE OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM,,9 January 2012,Comment,"Embrace this blessing in disguise; Freedom of religion is not itself religious – it puts religion in its proper place, argues Clifford Orwin",,CLIFFORD ORWIN   ,©2012 The Globe and Mail Inc.

With 60 monitors on the ground and another 90 to follow, the number of atrocities is too many and their locations too vast for observers to even scratch the surface. The observers are completely dependent on the Syrian government for transport and security and are unable to speak to victims without tipping off authorities, who have reportedly hidden hundreds of detainees in off-limits military sites.

Nobody had heard of stock options then. He lived in a nice house, but not a mansion. He did not make 250 times more money than the average Canadian, as some top bankers do today. Sometimes, he sounds rueful that he missed out on the bonanza years, when executive pay zoomed into the stratosphere. Mostly, though, he thinks the world has gone a little nuts.</p>",Document GLOB000020120105e8150001l,cacfpa : Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives,A17,764 words,,"<p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">So does Roger Martin, dean of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto. He says the way we pay executives today is ridiculous and perverse. And he thinks the worm may be about to turn. “Greed,” he says, “is not quite as good as it was before.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">A new report by the left-leaning Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives is helping to stir the pay pot. It found that the country's top 100 CEOs (that is, the 100 highest paid CEOs of companies listed in the TSX index) make, on average, $8.4-million, which is 189 times more than the average wage. Three-quarters of their income typically comes from stock options, which are tied to the company's stock-market performance. In 2010, average Canadian salaries went up 1 per cent. Theirs went up 27 per cent. Even in bad times, executive compensation just keeps going up.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">I'm no class warrior. If Frank Stronach can bully Magna's board into paying him $62-million, well, good for him. After all, he started the company. But what about the hired guns, which is what most CEOs are? Although their pay is supposedly related to performance, it's grown faster than a patch of kudzu vine in Georgia. In just 20 years between 1980 and 2000, says Mr. Martin, CEO pay per dollar of net income produced went up by a factor of eight.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">How did things get so out of whack? The answer you usually get is that the world is far more complex than ever before, companies are bigger and more global, outstanding talent is in short supply, blah, blah, blah. All true. But Mr. Martin believes there are more compelling reasons. In the 1970s, a series of economic shocks led people to focus on the types of incentives that might produce prosperity. That's when the idea of tying pay to performance was born.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">At the same time, the talent premium was soaring in every field, from sports to music. It seemed logical that top corporate leaders also deserved a piece of the upside. And then the cult of the CEO began to take off. Suddenly, bankers weren't boring, faceless drones any more. They were on the cover of Fortune. Soon, some of them were getting paid like rock stars.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The trouble is that corporations picked the wrong incentive. Instead of tying compensation to performance in the real world, they tied it to the stock price. This was one of the lousier ideas in the history of capitalism. It meant that the way to win was not to sell more stuff or make more money, but to increase the stock price. Much mischief has ensued, which you can read all about in Mr. Martin's excellent book, Fixing the Game. He thinks stock options should be abolished, period.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Stock options were not the only instance of perverse results. In the mid-1990s, public companies had to start disclosing the salaries of top management. It was thought that making this information public would help keep executive compensation in check. In fact, it triggered an ever-upward spiral. “It was like Lake Wobegon. Everybody said, ‘We don't want our CEO to be below average.' ”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Martin's crusade to pull the plug on stock options hasn't caught on just yet. But he's hopeful that the zeitgeist is changing again. Conspicuous consumption is out. Modesty, restraint and social responsibility are in. Today's business hero isn't the guy who builds a 60,000-square-foot mega-mansion. It's Steve Jobs, who lived in a relatively ordinary house.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“I think we've reached a tipping point,” Mr. Martin says. “I think enough people have begun to ask, ‘How is it that executives get to make lots of money even if the company doesn't do well?' ” That's what my friend who used to run the bank wonders, too.

After decades of complaining about the strings that Ottawa has attached to health-care funding, the provinces will now be able to do what they want with that money.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But with that freedom comes more responsibility and the ever-increasing pressure that rising health-care costs are putting on budgets.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">To that end, the premiers are expected to talk about joint strategies they can undertake to help slow some of those cost drivers. Those discussions will centre around initiatives that individual provinces have taken to reduce expenditures (innovation success stories), new funding models that are helping to shrink outlays, and ways to improve quality in the system that are also leading to savings.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall and Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty intend to press for an innovation fund that would help underwrite initiatives that would produce efficiencies in the system, such as electronic health records.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But before the first ministers get there, there will be more talk, some of it no doubt heated, about the funding model Mr. Flaherty unveiled to the premiers as a fait accompli.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The current health accord with Ottawa expires in 2014. Mr. Flaherty presented the premiers with a plan in which annual increases from the federal government stay at the current 6 per cent until 2017 and thereafter are tied to inflation and economic growth until the pact expires in 2024.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Almost immediately, the new deal that allocated funds on a per-capita basis rather than giving poorer provinces a disproportionate share of federal health dollars was hailed by growing and economically robust jurisdictions like Alberta, which will be the biggest winner under the revised formula. Provinces such as Quebec and Ontario, among others, were not as thrilled as they are likely to receive proportionately less money than they do now.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Ms. Clark, who will chair the first ministers' meeting, concedes that there are varying views among the premiers about Ottawa's offer.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“Some think of it as a starting point for negotiations, and others look at it and see it as a position that can be shaped and improved but not through a full-blown many-year-long negotiation,” Ms. Clark said in an interview. “Personally, I think we need to be focusing on a decision that we can shape.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">On that note, the B.C. Premier is going to table a proposal that seems fair on the surface but is certain to engender resistance from some of her colleagues, mostly notably Alberta Premier Alison Redford.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">While B.C. is pleased the new funding model leaves all decision-making on how it will be spent up to the provinces, Ms. Clark says it does not recognize demographics, which are a huge cost driver in the health-care system.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“I think the consequences of the new model, unintended as they are, are going to be severe for seniors all across the country,” Ms. Clark said. “The decision to go to straight per capita regardless of age represents a massive shift in health-care dollars away from senior citizens. We can't sustain a health-care system across the country under those circumstances.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">As such, B.C. would like to see the funding weighted to take into account senior citizens leaving snowbound outposts in Alberta in retirement for milder locations in its province.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In Canada, people between the ages of 65 and 75 cost the health-care system nearly triple what those under 65 do. Seniors 75 and over, meantime, are twice as expensive as those between the ages of 65 and 75.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“Straight per capita means you're giving a lot less money to provinces where seniors reside and a lot more to provinces where they don't,” Ms. Clark said. “So in B.C. where a lot of people move as they age we're going to see a growth in our allocation under the Canadian Health Transfer (CHT) of .05 per cent. In Alberta, they're going to see a growth in CHT of about 50 per cent.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Officials in the B.C. Ministry of Health have run numbers of what a new health funding formula might look like if it was weighted for demographics. Not surprisingly, B.C. (along with Quebec and New Brunswick, among others) would do much better, and provinces such as Ontario and Alberta would be worse off.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">This is why Ms. Clark's proposal is likely to be one of many difficult discussions Canada's premiers are going to have at this meeting.</p>",PROVINCIAL TALKS,,14 January 2012,Column,Debating a new model for health care; This week's conference in B.C. will hear arguments from premiers on demographics versus per-capita allocation of funds,,GARY MASON   ,©2012 The Globe and Mail Inc.

I like that mix.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Russell, 73, has renovated two houses since moving to Victoria from Regina more than a decade ago. The first was a homestead-style house covered in stucco and in disrepair as a long-time rental. During the renovation, it was learned the house dated not from 1900, as thought, but from 1861, when it was built for one of the first African-American families lured to the colony by Governor James Douglas.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The second is his current home in the James Bay neighbourhood. It is known as the Mansard House for its roofline, an uncommon style in Victoria. He did not include it in his self-published book, as the house once had been lifted to make room for a full basement, losing the original integrity of the design. He and his wife, Sharon, worked on the restoration, which received an award from the local Hallmark Heritage Society.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The long-time reporter and educator trained many of the reporters whose bylines can be read in British Columbia newspapers. As well, he wrote Morals and the Media, a book on ethics in journalism. (Insert your own wisecrack here.) He was senior editor of This Old House, a four-volume register of Victoria's historic homes produced by the Victoria Heritage Foundation.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Working with other researchers, Mr. Russell picked through the detritus of city hall's attic and found dusty ledgers with valuable information for those interested in researching house histories.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">So far, he has gathered 3,600 plumbing permits, 6,450 water permits and 8,218 building permits, a dreary accumulation of data for the uninitiated but a trove of detail for researchers.

The Harper government wants it built so badly it launched a campaign this week attacking opponents as radicals and puppets of foreign interests. Call that one the Prime Minister's pipeline.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The Premier's pipeline is the $1-billion Pacific Trails project, and construction is expected to begin this summer.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Both projects are bound for the port of Kitimat – the Gateway to be loaded with crude oil from Alberta; the Pacific Trails carrying natural gas from northeast B.C.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The Gateway proposal has generated an incendiary debate, with concerns about potential oil spill disasters – whether from leaky pipes or from the coastal tanker traffic – running smack up against a nationalist fervor to free Canada's resource industries from unfavourable dependence on the U.S. market. Pacific Trails, by comparison, has sailed through the approval process. Opposition New Democrats support the project. It has broad first nations buy-in, and the Clark government sees it as the key to developing a liquefied natural gas industry. It is a fossil fuel business that, relative to the oil sands, comes with a green seal of approval. But both developments bring environmental impacts to Kitimat's doorstep, and the province has little idea what the cumulative result of all this industry packed into the community will be.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">There are 13 regions in B.C. with an air quality management plan, but none for Kitimat which, despite the massive aluminum smelter perched on a hill to the west of town, is regarded by the province as having excellent air quality.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Between the Premier's ambitions and those of the Prime Minister, that could change. The pipelines are meant to end at Kitimat's port. The oil would be pumped into supertankers. Natural gas will be processed into LNG before moving on to the busy tanker port for transport.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">B.C. Environment Minister Terry Lake is expecting to have on his desk this spring a technical review of the Gateway project. It's not meant for public consumption, but it will guide his government in forming an opinion on the oil pipeline that would cross the province, and the oil tankers that would traverse the treacherous B.C. coastline.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Even with that information, the B.C. government probably won't come out clearly for or against the Gateway proposal. To say “no” would infuriate the conservative wing of the B.C. Liberal Party, which is being assiduously courted by the new B.C. Conservative Party. A “yes” would drive the influential green vote into the arms of the opposition New Democrats.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“It may sound like waffling,” Mr. Lake said in an interview. “But we want to listen to all of that information so that we understand all the possible ramifications and then decide how we react.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">B.C. has forfeited its opportunity to say no to Gateway formally, having signed a pact years ago giving the federal government control over projects that cross provincial borders. So the only aspect of development it can control is the LNG side. And there is growing uncertainty about what that will look like.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The province is expected to unwrap its natural gas strategy later this month. The Premier wants the jobs associated with an LNG industry, but there are complicating factors. Creating LNG is an energy-intensive process, and <span class=""companylink"">BC Hydro</span> doesn't have enough clean, green hydroelectricity for the three facilities Ms. Clark wants to see there. That means some will likely be burning natural gas to provide their own energy.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">If it turns out all this industrial development can't safely be sustained by Kitimat's air shed, will the province have to scale back its own objectives? Mr. Lake said there is no point studying the issue now, since the Gateway hasn't been approved yet and the extent of the LNG industry is still uncertain.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“We can say ‘these are the things we would like to see happen,' but we can't know for sure all of those things will happen, or can be done in a way that makes sense from an environmental point of view,” Mr. Lake said. “We're not saying these will happen come hell or high water.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">*****</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">AIR QUALITY</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The B.C. government has not studied what will happen to the air if Kitimat becomes the epicentre of a new liquefied natural gas industry plus the marine terminal for the Gateway oil pipeline. But Enbridge, the pipeline proponent, has done some modelling. The Kitimat Terminal “has the potential to measurably affect air quality … during the construction and operations phases,” states a study filed by Enbridge as part of its massive application to the National Energy Board.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Each year, approximately 220 tankers are expected to call at the marine terminal. Three tugs would assist each tanker in the three-hour process of berthing. After that, each tanker would be on standby for approximately 16 hours, all the while running steam and auxiliary boilers to keep the bunker oil hot and pumps running. Add just one LNG plant and, at maximum levels, the result would exceed air-quality objectives.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Karen Campbell, a lawyer at Ecojustice, said the report underscores the need for the province to look at air quality before signing off on any more industrial development in Kitimat. “At some point in time you are going to have some serious issues with the air quality in that air shed,” Ms. Campbell said.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Justine Hunter</p>",BC POLITICS / DISPATCH,,13 January 2012,British Columbia News: Column,"Two pipelines, two sides and a battle that's in the air",i13 : Crude Oil/Natural Gas | i1 : Energy,JUSTINE HUNTER   ,©2012 The Globe and Mail Inc.

These parties cost nothing and restore a faint sense of the 19th-century New England town hall meeting to the race. With only modest further adaptation, Canadian politics could benefit from having its own U.S.-style caucuses, the peculiar candidate-selection gatherings that turn political races into community discussions.</p>",Document GLOB000020120109e8190000h,,A13,732 words,,"<p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Take last week's Republican caucuses in Iowa, all 1,700 of them, as an example. Organized as separate decision-making events in every precinct (or ward) in the state, Iowa's caucuses are the very essence of grassroots politics. Anyone can participate, merely by registering at the door – and independent Iowa voters did so last week, helping to set an attendance record. A single caucus typically attracts 60 or 70 voters who are able, in the course of an evening, to explain their choice of candidate. In the end, voters gather in groups and vote publicly – no secret ballots here – in a counting of raised hands.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The theoretical flaw in the caucuses is that they slightly modify the principle of “one man, one vote” – by favouring partisans and other knowledgeable, articulate voters. This is also the primary benefit of the caucuses. Recall Winston Churchill's dictum: “The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Although marginally elitist, 19 states still use the caucuses in one form or another; 15 per cent of the delegates eventually chosen to attend the national conventions are determined by them. In Texas, for example, Democrats select 70 per cent of their delegates by a primary election, 30 per cent by caucuses – specifically to preserve the influence of party members who are more politically involved than the “average voter.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">At the same time, the caucuses preserve a grassroots populism that frightens some candidates. “They pick corn in Iowa,” Jon Huntsman, the former governor of Utah and former ambassador to China who aspires to the White House, said dismissively before the Iowa caucuses. “They pick presidents in New Hampshire.” Well, perhaps. But his explanation for blowing off Iowa sounds dubious. Since the 1970s, this farm state has served as a good, low-budget way for improbable presidential candidates to get noticed – which nicely balances whatever theoretical defects the caucuses may have.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The Iowa caucuses propelled Jimmy Carter, an obscure Democratic governor from Georgia, in 1976. (His second-place finish, behind “uncommitted voters,” made him look like a winner.) They propelled Barack Obama, an inexperienced Democratic senator from Illinois, in 2008. They propelled Republican Mike Huckabee, an unknown governor from Arkansas, in 2008; although he wasn't able to convert his first-place finish into a presidential nomination, he did get his own TV show on Fox. And they propelled Rick Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania – at least as far as Tuesday's primary in New Hampshire.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Iowa perpetuates other candidate-selection traditions. Last August, in Iowa's famous “straw poll” – the country's first popularity contest for Republican candidates in an election that doesn't count – former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty finished a distant third and abandoned his candidacy the next day. In an age of scientific polling, the straw poll might seem antiquated. In fact, it activates people months before real elections take place.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The American pursuit of the presidency, in a presidential election year, is perhaps the world's most mesmerizing democratic spectacle – a process that manages to produce a national consensus on presidential candidates within four months of New Year's Day. Or earlier. The great party conventions that will be staged this summer to nominate the Democratic and Republican candidates for the presidency will be held to affirm this consensus, not to form it.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The paradox is that the Iowa caucuses, like Iowa's straw poll, decide nothing. They exist only as an advisory to the state's summer convention delegates, all 25 of them (amongst 2,200 for the country), who'll be selected in elections in coming months. Yet, though meaning nothing, they decide a lot. And they're great fun.

No alcohol.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Billy Ding wrote me a letter. He is by no means the first restaurateur to try to capture my attention, but this guy tugged at my heartstrings pretty efficiently. He wrote: “I was a flight professional in Hong Kong. My ramen noodle master for three years taught me to hand-make good quality of ramen without putting any chemical and preservatives into it. … I am still bearing in mind that my Japanese master told me that ‘if I came and visit you and find out that you use chemical and MSG, I will be absolutely disgrace.'”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">So every day Billy only makes a certain amount of ramen, just enough for that day, and when he sells out, he closes the door to Jyuban Ramen House, which is in a quite large strip mall in Markham. A very special strip mall in that it also houses about a dozen Chinese restaurants, from which emanate the most wonderful smells.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">I am, as faithful readers of this column will recall, mad for ramen. I have rarely met a noodle I didn't love, and the combo of noodles with rich chicken or pork broth is enough to make my day. Especially in the winter. Could there be a better comfort food?</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But the problem with ramen is that most of it is so loaded with preservatives and MSG that we're getting a truckload of artificially jumped-up flavours. Which may be okay, depending on your feelings about chemicals in your food. Here's the thing: I prefer my food chemical-free. Billy's ramen is for sure purer than most of the other ramen in town. And the flavour buzz is … quieter. Which just serves to remind how addicted we've all become to chemically jacked-up tastes.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Billy makes three different kinds of ramen: For the pale-green spinach noodles, he grinds spinach into juice and mixes it into unbleached flour, which is then kneaded. Same deal for squid-ink pasta, and egg noodles get real eggs as opposed to the more common powdered eggs. The results are noodles with good strong flavour. Billy also eschews potassium sorbate, the noodle “strengthener” commonly used to give ramen both smoother texture and longer shelf life.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Jyuban's menu is small, as befits the maven of fresh-made daily noodles. The room is a standard ramen shop – unadorned, a variation on the fast-food theme. The pale green and cream walls and high ceiling are plain but soothing. It is a place of calm.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But avoid the apps, which I find nasty. The menu says shrimps kinpura are “absolutely different texture from tempura.” The server calls them tempura when she delivers them, and they taste and feel like lousy tempura, both greasy and mushy.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But the ramen is impeccable. Number 9 super-bowl ramen refers not to a football game but to the plethora of stuff in the bowl. There are all three kinds of noodles – spinach, squid ink and egg, each with its own characteristic taste. There is barely cooked bok choy, sweet pickled egg with properly oozing yolk, corn, green onions, fresh scallops in the shell, New Zealand mussels, sweet-cooked pork and diverse unidentifiable cuts of beef that are also sweet and almost tender. The broth is lighter than the usual ramen broth, with vegetable undertones.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The classic Japanese favourite ramen, tonkotsu, is pork-bone soup (pork bones simmered for many hours so that the stock catches all the flavour of meat and marrow and becomes milky) with egg noodles, corn, sweet pickled egg, boy choy, sweet pork and green onion, with crisp nori on top. The tonkotsu broth we're accustomed to is stronger than this, but it leaves me wondering: Have our taste buds become so addicted to chemical flavours and the artificial taste sensation of MSG that we don't like the real thing as much when we meet it? This is sort of like the problem I have with deep-fried food, which I know is not good for me. Offer me a choice between a shrimp tempura and a naked shrimp and I would rather eat the one in batter. I know it's not the right choice, but my palate has been trained to love crunch and grease, so I crave it.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Same deal with Jyuban's chemical-free broths. They feel almost too light on the tongue, and yet I know they're intrinsically better than the chemical-ridden standards of the ramen world. Is one to re-train one's palate to appreciate (and one hopes, eventually prefer) more pure food? I can't instruct you on that. I can tell you that Jyuban Ramen is a good place to start.</p>",THE DISH,,14 January 2012,Globe Toronto Column,Jyuban: Where ramen purists get their fill,i661 : Restaurants/Cafes/Fast Food Places | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos,JOANNE KATES   ,©2012 The Globe and Mail Inc.

That said, it was certainly a shrewd decision to plan his much-hyped poverty reality show for January – a notoriously slow news month in which the carcass of anything that even resembles a potential story can be chewed over for days by reporters.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Consequently, the news media have joined Mr. Brar for virtually every step of his journey – from the emotional goodbye to his family as he headed out the door to begin it all to his cheerless account this week of trying to find accommodations that he didn't have to share with an extended family of cockroaches.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Brar says he spilled tears imagining those who have to live their life in such spiritless and depressing surroundings. We'll have to take his word for it – about the tears, that is. Only six days into his adventure, Mr. Brar seems to have the media hooked – or at least on the hook to cover the story every step of the way. So to that extent, the stunt has worked brilliantly.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">I realize that may seem harsh, but, unfortunately, it is true. After a month “living on welfare,” Mr. Brar won't have a true understanding of what it's like to be poor and raising kids and having to go out and find a job in a jobless market. In a month's time, he'll go back to living in his beautiful home and the comfortable life that a salary in excess of $100,000 a year affords him.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">To hear Mr. Brar say, before he started his challenge, that he worried for his health was almost laughable. He is a big, fit-looking man who once played international basketball for India. Sure, he may drop a few pounds, which for most people after the holidays isn't a bad thing. There are people on January cleanses who will lose more weight than Mr. Brar does over the same period. He will never know what it's like to get near the end of the month with no money left and have to forgo food for the sake of kids who need it more.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">And there is no one who knows that better than New Democrats themselves.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Back in 2004, Liberal MLA Lorne Mayencourt decided to spend a week living on the streets of Vancouver. The move was derided by NDP MLAs at the time as a shameless stunt by someone deciding to play “tourist” in the Downtown Eastside. The New Democrats quoted community activists who said a person couldn't appreciate a life of true poverty unless they'd experienced it for at least two years.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">When B.C. Premier Christy Clark decided last spring to don a waitress's apron and serve coffee for a couple of hours in a bid to “walk in the shoes” of those making minimum wage, the ploy was universally derided. New Democrats damaged their eyes from rolling them so furiously.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">How is what Mr. Brar doing any different?</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The problem with this entire exercise is that it's solely political. It is intended to do one thing only: embarrass the government. And I suppose people are invited to imagine how it will all be better if and when the NDP gets into power.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">I'd have more respect for Mr. Brar if he eschewed crass political theatre and offered concrete solutions to a real public-policy dilemma. It's fine to say welfare rates are too low and the life they afford good, honest and decent people is immoral. But what will the New Democrats do? How will they change welfare policy in the province to make life easier for those on it? How much will they raise the rates? And where will the money come from?</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Even if Mr. Brar pledged on behalf of his party to end the shameless policy introduced under the Liberals to claw back every dollar a welfare recipient makes while on the dole, it would be more valuable than pretending to be poor.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Brar should know that it's tough to quit poverty.

The so-called Arab Spring has not been good news for them. In October, 27 people died when security forces opened fire on a crowd of peaceful demonstrators who had gathered to protest against church burnings. And last week, a teenaged Coptic boy was arrested for posting pictures of the Prophet Mohammed on his <span class=""companylink"">Facebook</span> page. “Copts worry that even mainstream Muslims don't really care that much about the defence of Coptic rights,” says Paul Sedra, associate professor of history at Simon Fraser University.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In Bangalore, India, 200 activists from a right-wing Hindu group invaded a Christian church during Sunday prayers, and attacked the pastor for allegedly trying to convert Hindus to Christianity by offering them bribes. “We were informed by a family member of one of the Hindu men taking baptism that he was asked to convert to Christianity as he loved a Christian girl,” one activist told a reporter. “We immediately rushed to the church and stopped the conversion process.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In Pakistan, Asia Bibi, a Christian mother sentenced to death for blasphemy, is doing “well,” according to her husband. She was sentenced after drinking water from a well reserved for Muslims, and for allegedly making derogatory remarks about Mohammed. Rights groups have reported that she is so frail she can barely stand. Shahbaz Bhatti, a Christian cabinet minister who tried to defend her, was assassinated last March.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In Nigeria, a violent pseudo-Islamic sect called Boko Haram is thought to be behind a series of deadly church bombings, including one on Christmas Day. Christian-Muslim tensions are on the rise, and Christians have also massacred Muslims. In Uganda, on Christmas Eve, Islamic extremists threw acid on a church leader and partly blinded him.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, the country's leading bishop warned that Muslim fundamentalists are attacking Christians with impunity. Mobs have burned and ransacked churches, and rights groups say violence against religious minorities has escalated. This week, according to The Jakarta Globe, a hard-line Muslim group attacked church members over a bumper sticker saying, “We need a friendly Islam, not an angry Islam.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In Iraq, two-thirds of the pre-war Christian population has fled the country. Some experts predict that Christianity in that country, as well as in the lands where Jesus walked, will soon be extinct.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">You get the picture. Religious strife is on the rise, and religious persecution is a serious problem in some of the world's biggest countries. Say what you like about the Harper government's plan to launch an Office of Religious Freedom as part of its foreign policy. You can say that it's naive, or dumb, or a blatant effort to appeal to the domestic religious base. But you can't say the issue doesn't matter.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In the U.S., scholars across the political spectrum are trying to persuade the Obama administration to give the issue much higher priority. Among them is Thomas Farr, director of the Religious Freedom Project at the Berkley Center in the U.S. On his blog, he's argued that people “who think this idea is a fantasy of the Christian right, or that it represents illicit American exceptionalism, or cultural imperialism” fail to understand the connection between religious freedom and fundamental issues of justice and human dignity. Where religion still matters, promoting religious freedom is one of the most important ways to promote human freedom.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Last summer, the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life released a sobering look at the decline of religious freedoms around the world. It found that between 2006 and 2009, restrictions on religious beliefs and practices rose in 23 countries. Because some of these countries are so populous, the increases affected a much larger share of peoples and states. “More than 2.2 billion people – nearly a third of the world total population – live in countries where either government restrictions on religion or social hostilities involving religion rose substantially.” Governments in 101 countries used some measure of force against religious individuals or groups, “including individuals being killed, physically abused, imprisoned, detained or displaced from their homes, as well as damage to or destruction of personal or religious properties.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Many in the secular West like to think that religion is playing less of a role in world affairs. They couldn't be more wrong. As religion scholar Philip Jenkins warns, religious conflict and issues of minority rights will play a major role in world affairs for years to come. “The most disturbing features of contemporary Christian/Muslim conflict is how very commonplace they have become,” he writes. “The blood-shed in Nigeria and Indonesia does receive some coverage in the West, yet violence of this sort has become almost too widespread to report.” Ex-panding Christian minorities are likely to provoke violent reactions from Muslims and others who feel threatened, he says.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">If you're interested in the forces that will shape the geopolitics of this century, a serious study of religion is a good place to start.

The NDP stands out in international terms not only for Audrey McLaughlin and Alexa McDonough's successive terms at the helm between 1989 and 2003, but also for B.C. MLA Rosemary Brown's path-breaking leadership run in 1975.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Moreover, the NDP is unusual for the sustained numerical presence of women MPs, a result, in part, of internal rules that mandate the recruitment of female candidates in winnable seats. After the 2006 federal election, for instance, women constituted more than 40 per cent of NDP MPs, compared with 11 per cent of the Conservative caucus.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Even with these strides, however, we can't assume that gender barriers have disappeared in the NDP. Ms. Nash, Ms. Ashton and their supporters need to pay close attention to two problems.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">First, the federal party's weak standing after 1989 remains a powerful drag on women's upward mobility. Female candidates in 2012 need to present a compelling account of the foundational work carried out by party leaders, including Ed Broadbent, Ms. McLaughlin and Ms. McDonough, in the years before Jack Layton's 2003 election to the top post. In particular, female candidates need to acknowledge the contributions of each predecessor in a way that's both respectful and wide-eyed, in the sense that it addresses the anxiety party members feel about past electoral setbacks.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Second, Ms. Nash and Ms. Ashton must compete based on substance rather than style or tone. To date, both have focused their campaigns on matters of process rather than public policy: Ms. Nash stresses her skills as a bridge-builder who can bring together disparate elements of the party as well as the country, while Ms. Ashton says she'll practise a “new politics” – echoing a phrase that sounded considerably fresher when Kim Campbell used it in the 1993 federal Progressive Conservative leadership race.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The presence of high-profile female politicians has become so routine that these clichés risk undermining the candidates who use them. It's true that many female politicians, such as Alberta Premier Alison Redford, practise politics differently than their predecessors. Yet, they succeed not by asserting the existence of that distinctive style, but by demonstrating its impact on policy.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Ms. Nash and Ms. Ashton can draw on extensive organizational research that documents the greater willingness of female managers to transcend traditional hierarchies, and thus develop strong teams that reach decisions based on consensus rather than conflict. Framing their own backgrounds in light of this literature has the advantage of not just drawing attention to the interpersonal qualities of other candidates, but also shining a spotlight on how relevant each candidate's skill set is to present challenges facing the party.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In the realm of politics, though, leadership choices largely come down to judging which candidate offers the best chance of electoral success.

Each time, the party was seen as arrogant, out of touch and out of date. Liberals bounced back by reaching out to new people with new ideas, and modernizing their organization.

Widening participation in selecting the next permanent leader and the next generation of Liberal candidates beyond the paid membership to all registered party “supporters.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">These proposals, if adopted, would revolutionize democratic engagement in Canada, changing the very nature of political power and how it's exercised.

They grow grapes with alluring names like Ortega, Bacchus and Marechal Foch – varietals more often found growing in northern Germany and France.</p>",Document GLOB000020120106e8160002e,,S3,989 words,,"<p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Muse is a popular stop on Vancouver Island wine tours, but the wine is almost impossible to buy outside British Columbia. For all but the biggest of B.C.'s 200 wineries, the Rockies present a solid barrier to selling their products to other provinces.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Last year the Ellmanns tried to work through the legal hurdles presented by the prohibition-era law, the Importation of Intoxicating Liquors Act, by sending their wines to Alberta's liquor commission for distribution. By the time the government was done, a bottle of their award-winning “Voluptuous Vixen” Foch Noir cost an extra $10. “After all that work, we didn't make any money,” Ms. Ellmann said.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The B.C.

There is inertia in these things.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Dix says it is worth taking a hit on provincial liquor revenues to allow the province's wineries to sell their products directly to Canadians outside B.C. Coming from a politician better known for wanting to raise business taxes to pay for social programs, it's a remarkably free-enterprise approach. He's earned kudos from Conservative MP Dan Albas, the Okanagan-Coquihalla MP who is pushing a private member's bill in Ottawa to change the federal law. Mr. Albas would give each province the right to set personal exemptions so that a Calgary oenophile could order a case of wine directly from an Okanagan vintner.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The current law is easily evaded by tourists who drive across the border. What B.C.'s winemakers really want is to free up online sales and make inroads into the lucrative Ontario market.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Averill Creek winemaker Andy Johnston holds the current law in contempt. “It's a joke, a farce,” he said. In defiance, his Cowichan Valley vineyard will ship wine across the country by courier, but most of the 7,000 cases he produces each year are consumed in B.C. because distribution through other provincial liquor boards – Ontario in particular – is a nightmare.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In Ottawa, Mr. Albas' proposed change has won support across party lines, but the provinces are lukewarm. “There is not one province that has indicated they think it's a great idea,” noted Miles Prodan, executive director of the B.C. Wine Institute. Ontario wants to protect its own wine industry, but all the provinces are concerned about loss of revenues if wineries can sidestep provincial liquor control boards.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">B.C. Premier Christy Clark has applauded Mr. Albas' efforts, and has pledged to work with the other provinces to open new domestic markets to B.C. wines. But it is hard to see where Ms. Clark has taken action. There's no indication she raised it at any of her meetings with other premiers to date, and she is not expected to bring it up when she hosts the premiers for a conference later this month.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Nirmal Gidda, proprietor of the Mt. Boucherie Family Estate Winery in Kelowna, can't figure out why the B.C. Liberals aren't all over this issue. He can measure the value of the wine tourism trade in the Okanagan by the Alberta licence plates that dominate his parking lot every summer. They can – and do – bring wine home with them, but being able to sell wine over the telephone or Internet would be a huge boon. “It would probably increase our revenues by 25 to 30 per cent to be able to ship to private customers in Alberta,” Mr. Gidda figures.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The Okanagan – the province's prime wine region – has reliably returned B.C. Liberals to the legislature for two decades. Mr. Gidda's nearest vineyard neighbour is Quail's Gate, owned by B.C. Liberal MLA Ben Stewart. “And yet it's hard to get any commitment from them,” Mr. Gidda said. “We need to have somebody step up to the plate.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Despite the B.C. Liberals' apparent stranglehold on the region, the NDP Leader senses an opportunity. Since winning the party leadership last spring, Mr. Dix has visited here 17 times. “They are taken for granted by the B.C. Liberals,” he said. “I'm not going to write the Okanagan off.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">By pushing Ms. Clark's government on this issue, Mr. Dix is giving the grape trade someone to cheer for.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">******</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">THE B.C.

I say this because excessive argument about what's effectively a microstructure in a sizable federal department perpetuates a long-standing weakness in Canada's foreign policy debates: an intellectual obsession with “ends” (in this case, protecting religious minorities around the world) at the expense of building the strategic “means” to achieve any “ends” of consequence.</p>",Document GLOB000020120104e81400034,,A13,755 words,,"<p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Successive governments in Ottawa have all too easily subscribed to the conventional wisdom that if we as a country could only determine what our interests were, what our principles or values were, and indeed what our core international purpose was, then we could, by logic, proceed to advance a coherent and effective foreign policy agenda. All of these, of course, are concerns solely about the “ends” of our foreign policy.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Naturally, as Canada is a vast and diverse land, and as different prime ministers have different conceptions of what the country ought to do in the world, the country almost never reaches a point of general “consensus” about which “ends” are worth pursuing. And so the debate continues ad nauseam, with perhaps only isolationists totally sated by the conceptual impasse that has led us to underperform as a country on the global stage.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The core of the foreign policy and larger international affairs debate in Canada should not be about the ends we may wish to pursue as a collective, but rather about the means necessary to advance the ends legitimately chosen by any elected government. The desired ends will clearly change according to the times and government, but the means to success for Canada are stable and undifferentiated, and they need to be built up.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Without this reversal of strategic logic (means before ends, rather than ends dictating means), we Canadians are left talking to ourselves about problems in the world we're interested in but typically incapable of solving – for lack of the requisite means to do so.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">One is reminded of the 2007 speech by Prime Minister Stephen Harper about Canada's intending to become a leader in the Americas (a perfectly legitimate “end” goal for a wealthy, reputable country such as Canada). Some years from now, historians in Latin America may wonder just how Canada planned to achieve its stated end of regional leadership. Answer: With no Spanish speakers! Or Portuguese speakers, for that matter. (By the time Australia had determined it wished to be a player in Asia, future prime minister Kevin Rudd – then chief of staff to the premier of Queensland – had already convinced the federal and state governments that the country needed a national Asian languages strategy.)</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">So what's the nature of the “means” debate that Canada needs to have to be a major (and credible) global player this century? Two interrelated “means” levers need to be addressed: national culture and national capabilities. A country that's serious about advancing ambitious ends in the world – defending minority religions or, say, brokering peace and transforming impoverished countries, or even fighting a just war – requires a public culture that can properly assess happenings beyond North America, and can support sustained engagement by Canada beyond our borders. More concretely, it needs the practical capabilities to advance these ends: talent (in key positions), assets (intelligence, military, diplomatic), money and, to be sure, differentiated relationships with players in the world.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">To be a leader not only in the Americas but also in the world, Canada needs more foreign affairs culture, and certainly more capabilities. We might start by creating that army of Spanish and Portuguese speakers that the federal government surely requires to advance its stated ends. Let's add some Mandarin and Arabic speakers for good measure.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">None of this is possible without a brave political leadership that applies pressure over time to build the culture and capabilities today that will allow us to score major foreign policy achievements in the long term. But we can be confident that transformation of the Canadian means to regularly realize great projects in the world will make small potatoes of the current argument over the Office of Religious Freedom.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Irvin Studin is program director and assistant professor in the School of Public Policy and Governance at the University of Toronto.</p>",FOREIGN POLICY,,4 January 2012,Comment,Here's how Canada can be a global player,,IRVIN STUDIN   ,©2012 The Globe and Mail Inc.

Early work is beginning on the air-rail link between Pearson airport and Union Station, which will give Toronto something that other leading cities have had for years: a direct train route from airport to downtown and back.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">New, dedicated bus lanes are being built in York and Mississauga to speed commuters through heavy suburban traffic. Premier Dalton McGuinty has promised to bring all-day service to the GO train system. The <span class=""companylink"">Toronto Transit Commission</span> has agreed to adopt the Presto smart card payment system, already rolling out on the GO network and suburban transit services. And work continues on the northward extension of the Spadina subway.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Most ambitious of all is the Eglinton-Scarborough Crosstown Project, a new 25-kilometre light-rail transit line that will take riders from Black Creek Drive to Scarborough city centre. A new report says the $8.2-billion line is the most expensive infrastructure project in all of Canada. In its annual report on the country's top 100 infrastructure projects, ReNew magazine pegged the Crosstown at No. 1.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Construction is already in progress. Workers are digging a giant hole near Black Creek and Eglinton. Massive boring machines will be lowered into it to begin tunnelling for the underground stretch of the line. Metrolinx, the regional transit agency, expects it to open by 2020. ReNew calls it “one of the largest public transit investments in Canadian history.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">All of this has to be encouraging for hard-pressed Toronto commuters, who have waited decades for serious expansion of the transit network. The Yonge subway line opened in 1954, the University line in 1963, the Bloor-Danforth line in 1966, the Spadina line in 1978 and the Scarborough RT in 1985. Since then, the only new line has been the five-station Sheppard “stubway” in 2002. Even as the population boomed with the arrival of hundreds of thousands of new immigrants, the transit build-out stalled.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Now, at long last, things are happening – and about time, too. Demand for transit is rising fast, with more than 500 million riders expected to take the TTC this year, a new record. The city has a chance to catch up for years of transit delay and neglect.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But given Toronto's sad history of stop-and-start transit planning, it's only reasonable to wonder whether it will all unfold just as planned. A previous attempt to build an Eglinton subway fell apart when Premier Mike Harris cancelled it to save money. Then, as now, the provincial government faced a massive budget deficit.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Big-ticket transit projects make easy targets for budget cutters. Don't forget that the McGuinty government itself delayed billions in funding for the Transit City light-rail project, later killed by Mayor Rob Ford. With credit-rating agencies breathing down its neck, will it be tempted to pull back funding for the Crosstown?</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Ford forced up the cost of the line by around $2-billion when he insisted that most of it travel underground, even the stretch along the eastern reaches of Eglinton that was supposed to go on the surface under the initial plan. For that reason, the project moved from No. 4 to No. 1 on ReNew's top 100 infrastructure list. Queen's Park bean counters may wonder whether going back to Plan A wouldn't make more sense.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Another big question mark floats over Mr. Ford's cherished Sheppard subway extension. Because all or most of the money from Transit City is now going to build the Crosstown, a provincial project, no one quite knows how Sheppard is going to be financed, if it happens at all.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">So it goes in the world of Toronto transit.

The Reformers said gold-plated MP pensions put politicians out of touch with ordinary Canadians. They did the noble thing by “opting out” of the parliamentary pension plan. But when Jean Chrétien's government gave them the opportunity to retroactively opt in after the 2000 election, the take-up was nearly unanimous.</p>",Document GLOB000020120103e8130000j,,A13,722 words,,"<p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The math was so simple that MP Ian McClelland, by then a member of the Canadian Alliance, described his dilemma this way: “To choose between being called a hypocrite and stupid, I would choose to be called a hypocrite.” Colleague Monte Solberg observed that refusing the pension was like wearing a hair shirt.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In the grand scheme of things, the $25-million taxpayers put into the MP pension plan last year is small potatoes.

Last month, the C.D. Howe Institute calculated that the federal public pension liability is $80-billion higher than government estimates. Except among public-sector devotees, it's hard to find anyone who believes that pensions for government workers are connected to economic reality.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But before MPs take on public-sector pensions, they need to look in the mirror. Some parliamentarians argue that they are in a different category than public servants because they sacrifice their best income-earning years to serve the greater good. But for many, being an MP is the best job they will ever have. For high achievers such as Jim Prentice (now vice-chairman for CIBC), it's hard to say his time in Ottawa hurt his long-term earning potential.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">What makes it all the more difficult for MPs to tackle public servants' pensions is the advantages they hold over their underlings:</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">While government workers get 2 per cent credit of earnings for each year of service, MPs get 3 per cent.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">A long-serving MP's pension tops out at 75 per cent of “best earnings,” whereas government workers get 70 per cent.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">MPs contribute 7 per cent of their salaries to pension, while government workers contribute 8.4 per cent.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">If Stephen Harper's government is looking for inspiration, it should consider what Mike Harris did in Ontario in 1996. Today, Ontario MPPs contribute 10 per cent of their income into an RRSP-style system. As the economy goes, so goes the value of the pension.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Unfortunately for Ontario taxpayers, Mr. Harris did not take the next logical step and convert all public-sector pensions into a defined-contribution RRSP system. But unlike MPPs, government workers had unions to guard their entitlements.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Perhaps the best evidence that MP and public-sector pensions are going the way of the dodo bird is what began happening on Jan. 1, right under Mr. Harper's nose. As of that date, membership in the <span class=""companylink"">Export Development Canada</span> defined-benefit pension plan has been cut off, with all new hires enrolled in a defined-contribution pension plan.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">As a financial institution, EDC is following the example set by the Royal Bank, which is also now placing new hires into a defined-contribution pension stream.

But while government plans may be the last bastion, fall they will.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">By limiting pension reforms to new hires and the newly elected, Mr. Harper can gain support from those already in the system.

He served previously as a city councillor and as a school-board member. He also managed Hillary Rodham Clinton's successful campaign for the U.S. Senate in 2000.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">This is not an apolitical position, such as the Vancouver city manager.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">He is elected and along with the mayor and the city's comptroller occupies one of three positions elected by all five boroughs.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">He is a Democrat who once received a shout out on The West Wing when Rob Lowe's character could be seen standing in front of a whiteboard on which the words “Call B.

Along with shaming landlords into repairing their buildings, Mr. de Blasio has proposed minimum fines for landlords who fail to address serious issues, such as peeling lead paint or a lack of heat in buildings. The measures are part of his eight-point plan to make rental housing safer. At the same time, he contended landlords need to be made aware of government-sponsored programs that could help them carry out repairs. He also said they should be rewarded when they make improvements. The reward, in version 2.0 of the “Worst Landlords” registry, is that they get special mention as owners who have earned their way off the list.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Back here at home, Mr. Stevenson said he wants to be less confrontational.

By that time, a large swath of the Canadian voting public, especially those under 40, will remember nothing of those tumultuous times. Outside Ontario, chances are that voters would know nothing about those years, just as Ontarians wouldn't have clear opinions about Mike Harcourt's years as premier of B.C. or Don Getty's as premier of Alberta.</p>",Document GLOB000020120114e81e0001m,,F9,687 words,,"<p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Of course, the Harper Conservatives will try to remind people of Mr. Rae's time as premier and paint it with the blackest of colours. That's how the Conservatives do politics: Tear down opposition leaders. The Conservative campaign against Mr. Rae has already begun. It will continue through the next election because, barring unexpected developments, Mr. Rae will lead the Liberals in that campaign.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Rae is the “interim” Liberal leader. In theory, the leadership race is supposed to start late next winter; in practice, it has begun with only one candidate, Mr. Rae. There is, frankly, no one else. If there were, Mr. Rae could leave.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Liberals can dream of Justin Trudeau, except he has ruled out a leadership bid. They can think of New Brunswick MP Dominic LeBlanc, who might be ready for prime time some years from now. They can ponder Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty. But the more they ponder, the more they'll realize that the last man standing will be Bob Rae.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Twice, the Liberals passed over Mr. Rae – once for Stéphane Dion, once for Michael Ignatieff. Mr. Rae was the most experienced, the best speaker, the more natural politician – yet, he lost twice.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Yes, his time as NDP premier counted against him with some Liberals, either because they couldn't forget his lacerating attacks on their party before he switched sides, or because they feared those years would be used against him to telling effect.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">There were other, deeper reasons. Mr. Rae never gave the Liberals a clear enough narrative why he wanted to be leader and where he wanted to go. He offered the party himself and his talents, and they weren't enough.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">When dealing with his time as NDP premier, Mr. Rae can't find the right narrative even now. Being a proud man, he defends those years, talking correctly about the difficulties of the recession Ontario faced, the challenges he overcame, the progress he made – although the generalized historical view is that of a buffeted and unsuccessful government. Ontarians apparently thought so. They decisively dumped the NDP at the first opportunity.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Having poured his reflections into books and speeches, Mr. Rae left the NDP. Here's where the narrative failed. In appealing to Liberals for their votes, he never explained why he and the Liberal Party could achieve objectives (other than taking power) that the NDP couldn't.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Rae never told Canadians why liberalism trumped social democracy, or why the Liberals reflected better than the NDP what he came to believe in. Now, the party desperately needs that narrative to bring at least some of those former Liberals back.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Rae can seek the leadership again as a way of personal vindication: At his age, and with his innate love of politics, it's hard to imagine him preferring a law firm to leading the Liberal Party. Politics was injected into his blood early – first at university, then as a young NDP MP. It still courses in his veins. He's a man of many interests beyond family, but one trumps all: politics.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Beleaguered Liberals could have fallen into factional infighting, as shattered parties often do. Under Mr. Rae, harmony has reigned in caucus, fundraising has picked up, media exposure has been won, and Mr. Rae has earned the highest badge of partisan honour: personal attacks from the Conservatives.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">He pledged when becoming “interim” leader not to seek the job thereafter.

Hockey was played in the province, especially in the mining towns in the frozen valleys of the Kootenays, but fair weather on southern Vancouver Island permitted only the occasional children's game of shinny on a frozen shallow pond.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">On that day a century ago, the seven players of the New Westminster Royals sailed across the strait to play the Victoria Senators in the inaugural game of the three-team Pacific Coast Hockey Association.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The modern arena with artificial ice, as well as the three teams and the league in which they played, were the creation of Frank and Lester Patrick, ambitious and far-sighted brothers who had made a fortune with their father in the lumber business.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The brothers played pro hockey back east. They figured another fortune was to be made in promoting the sport in the booming Pacific port cities. They intended to challenge for the Stanley Cup, which even then inspired fevered dreams of hockey glory.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In Vancouver, they built a grand $175,000 arena on Georgia Street overlooking Coal Harbour. The Denman Arena, as it came to be known, boasted a seating capacity of 10,000, making it the largest in the Dominion. Incredibly, the city's population was just 120,000, though it had doubled in five years and the Patricks anticipated further growth.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In Victoria, they built a more modest, but still modern, building of wood. It stood at the corner of Cadboro Bay Road and what is now Epworth Street. (The arena burned to the ground in the early morning hours of Remembrance Day in 1929. The flames, first spotted by a passing milkman, lit up the night sky. The site is now occupied by a pair of three-storey apartment blocks across the street from the Oak Bay Secondary sporting grounds.)</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The world-class arenas helped lure to the coast some of the best-known names in hockey, including Newsy Lalonde, Harry Hyland and Tom Dunderdale. (The Vancouver Millionaires also employed a 19-year-old player called Silent Jack Ulrich, as he was deaf and mute.)</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The Royals wore black and orange sweaters, while the Senators sported a red, white and blue combination.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The sportswriters wrote in purple.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“Every moment provided a fresh sensation and never while playing was going on was the blood given time to cool,” ran a report in the Daily Times. “As the puck darted hither and thither with such dazzling rapidity that at times it was impossible for the crowd to follow its course, the most phlegmatic were stirred to their deepest depths; as spectacular burst crowded upon spectacular burst in almost unending succession, this unrestrained delight brought the spectators up all standing.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Of course the referee came in for criticism from the Daily Colonist for having missed “one or two roughhouse stunts.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The Victoria arena opened to the public with an offer of free skating on Christmas Day, leading several downtown stores to advertise a new stock of equipment, with the cheapest pair of men's “skating boots” available for $2.50.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Victoria lost the first game at the arena by 8-3. In goal for the home side was 31-year-old veteran Bert Lindsay, whose son also became a hockey star. Terrible Ted Lindsay is now 86.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The Patricks are credited with such innovations as forward passing, adding bluelines and substituting skaters while play continued. They also sold franchises to interests in Seattle and Portland, Ore., creating an international major pro league a decade before the National Hockey League allowed a New England grocery-store magnate to enter their league with the Boston Bruins.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">At the end of the short 1912 season, Frank Patrick suggested the Stanley Cup be decided by a series of games, not just a two-game playoff, as was the practice.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">His league sent a letter to the Stanley Cup trustees offering to send a champion by train to Eastern Canada to challenge for the trophy. The suggestion was rejected, as the natural ice used in rinks in Montreal, Toronto and Quebec City would be too slushy by late March. By the end of 1912, the Arena Gardens (later known as the Mutual Street Arena) in Toronto had artificial ice. It was the way of the future of pro hockey.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">These days, the Stanley Cup finals end in balmy June.

The city was not in such bad financial shape after all. Mr. Ford had manufactured a crisis to justify spending cuts that were simply not needed.</p>",Document GLOB000020120114e81e0002c,,A14,609 words,,"<p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">It proved nothing of the sort. The city often finds itself with sudden windfalls at year-end when tax revenues come in higher or spending lower than expected. Because Toronto is required by law to have a balanced budget, officials are careful to make conservative projections at the start of the year, giving themselves some leeway when the bills come due. The result is often a tidy, and tempting, year-end surplus.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">For years, the city has been using part of this money to cover expenses for the year to come. It is like relying on sofa-cushion money to pay the mortgage. It is not part of the household budget and you can't count on it. It means that the city is paying its bills with unsustainable, unpredictable revenue, leaving it to begin each annual budget struggle from behind the eight ball.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">This is a sloppy, unwise practice and Mr. Ford is right to want to end it. City finance officials have been saying for years that Toronto should quit relying on windfall money to plug its annual budget gap. Using the temporary surpluses and dipping into reserves only masks the fact that, in truth, the city's spending chronically exceeds its permanent revenue. This “structural deficit” has dogged the city's books for years, making it hard to find the wherewithal to pay for critical needs.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Now, at long last, the city is moving to close that chasm. This year, instead of using its windfall to pay for current programs its income won't support, it plans to put aside the extra $154-million for future needs. A proposal from the city's executive committee, which will go to city council next week, would see the money go toward a fund for TTC capital projects like the purchase of new streetcars.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Chief financial officer Cam Weldon said this week that by preserving rather than spending the windfall, the new budget approach “takes us a long way to fiscal sustainability.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Unfortunately, if predictably, the mayor's critics are not listening. No sooner did city officials announce their new surplus numbers than city council's left erupted in outrage at the mayor. How dare he try to cut services when he had all that extra cash to pay for them? Why would he put away money for a rainy day with $154-million in hand?</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“As if it isn't a rainy day when even wading pools are deemed unaffordable,” huffed the Toronto Star, referring to the unspeakably cruel decision to close five city wading pools that are underused and in need of repair.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In truth, the Ford administration has shown itself quite willing to use new-found resources to save services that face the chop. Mr. Ford is backing a staff proposal to save threatened student-nutrition programs and community centres by dipping into an extra $8.8-million income from the property tax. But here is the difference: This money comes from permanent growth in tax assessments, not a one-time windfall.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Using that kind of ongoing income to pay for ongoing needs make sense.

They're committed politicians, dedicated to the public interest as they perceive it. In one form or another, all are bilingual, most of them impressively so. Parties should be so lucky to have such a choice. Frankly, it's doubtful the Liberals or Conservatives could field a group of eight such intelligent candidates.</p>",Document GLOB000020120106e81600011,,A13,717 words,,"<p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Listening to them and reading their policy papers (such as they are) reminds Canadians of what to like about the NDP, and what to fear. What to like is the emphasis on inclusion in politics and greater equality of opportunity for the marginalized and dispossessed.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">At a time of growing inequality, it's imperative that political actors put the issue front and centre on the national agenda. It's also important that some party keep hammering away on the environment, especially climate change. So, kudos to the NDP for supporting a cap-and-trade system for Canada.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">What's not to like, however, is the old NDP bugbear: The party is much better at thinking about how to redistribute wealth than create it. Running through the party's leadership discourse is continuing skepticism about the free market, free trade and the globalized economy. About the only idea that candidates offer for wealth creation is a kind of public investment fund, or a public infrastructure fund. For those of an entrepreneurial bent in Canada or those trying to get ahead on their investments, the party offers nothing.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Instead, the candidates prefer industrial policies to freer markets, clearly distrust large businesses, whose tax rates they wish to raise sharply, and prefer something called “fair trade” to free trade, which invariably means the party winds up opposing free-trade deals. For a deeply trade-dependent economy such as Canada, that systematic hostility is utterly counterproductive – especially given the importance of diversifying Canada's excessive dependence on the U.S. market.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Latent protectionism lies deep in the NDP's soul. So does the belief that government is there not just to provide public services and to regulate private activity, but to direct private investment, inject public money into enterprises, and generally try to steer the economy with public funds, public regulations and trade protection. It's a very old recipe.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">It's not surprising that NDP candidates should take this view of the world, since some of the prominent ones (Peggy Nash and Brian Topp, for example) come from the trade union world. But that world, numerically speaking, is a dwindling one. It has also been changing, as public-sector unions become ever-more prominent within the labour movement.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Naturally, therefore, the NDP is locked into the belief that public services can only be delivered in the traditional public-sector union manner, meaning that the interests of providers, and not necessarily those of taxpayers, are at the heart of the way these public services are structured and delivered.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The NDP candidates are certainly not alone in making promises for which no money is easily available. Their campaign documents are full of such pledges, with the only revenue source apparently being a rollback of corporate tax cuts. Alas, the money recaptured from that rollback couldn't possibly finance all their commitments.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Topp moved out from the pack by proposing very big tax increases not just on corporations but on individuals being paid more than $250,000 and making money from capital gains and stock options. Mr. Topps figures his tax hikes would raise $18-billion, but his number assumes (wrongly) that people and companies wouldn't rearrange their affairs to minimize the tax hit.

They backed a more open immigration policy than the Conservatives, who tended to be the party of white Protestants with a few Irish Catholics. Now there's an all-party consensus on immigration, and the Conservatives, having starting driving up immigration levels under Brian Mulroney, fight for immigrant votes even more forcefully than Liberals.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Liberals were the bridging party between Quebec and the rest of Canada, and between francophones and anglophones. Quebec has now faded from the consciousness of other Canadians, and vice versa.

The middle class, however, has been under tremendous financial squeeze. Its numbers are shrinking as income inequalities widen. The pressures on middle-class families make them want to keep more of what they earn, precisely the pitch Conservatives have successfully made to them.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Liberals were always the party of Canadian nationalism, but Conservatives are busy creating their own identification with historic, national symbols: the military, the monarchy, old wars and former Conservative prime ministers. And Canadian nationalism, which seemed to need nurturing for so long, has become ubiquitous, boisterous and self-confident, the property of no party any more.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">All these, and other, trends have been eating at the Liberal Party for a long time.

It is becoming common to see double- and triple-bunking of inmates in cells designed for one. This overcrowding limits access to already scarce rehabilitative programming and increases the incidence of institutional violence.

Decades of reports have detailed our correctional systems' failure to reasonably address the needs of these offenders and limit their numbers.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Bill C-10, the Safe Streets and Communities Act, which is before the Senate, will significantly increase the prison population. The Canadian Bar Association, summarizing its testimony before the House of Commons standing committee on justice and human rights, stated that the bill “will require new prisons; mandate incarceration for minor, non-violent offences; justify poor treatment of inmates and make their reintegration into society more difficult.” These results are inconsistent with our collective concepts of fairness, compassion and equality. In addition, no evidence is provided to support the bill's objectives.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Meantime, the message from other jurisdictions that have pursued increased incarceration as a solution to safer communities is clear.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In an editorial on Dec. 6, 2010, The New York Times stated: “There is almost unanimous condemnation of California-style mass incarceration, which has led to no reduction in serious crime and has turned many inmates into habitual criminals.

Aiming to reverse nearly 20 years of punitive criminal justice culture, the report said, Mr. Clarke “signalled that he would sweep away aspects of the statutory sentencing framework in England and Wales that ‘unhelpfully fetters' the ability of judges to make the sentence fit the crime.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Our collective experience and decades of research tell us that increased rates of incarceration neither decrease crime nor act as a deterrent to it. Safer communities and effective crime prevention are achieved through the development of integrated systems with both the flexibility and resources required to respond to individuals in a timely fashion. As a society, we must be prepared to actively support and finance early intervention strategies for youth; a judicial process with options to ensure that incarceration is a last resort; a community mental-health system that keeps the ill out of jail; a prison service that addresses individual offenders' problems rather than acting as a human warehouse; and conditional-release programming that supports timely, safe community reintegration.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Our focus and our resources should be directed toward keeping people out of jail, not in it.

Becoming new, as some genius once concluded, means turning away from the old. Moving the country to its final stage of independence certainly has a modernizing look.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The monarchy is hanging on in many countries, but it's hardly the way of the future. In Jamaica, the new Prime Minister, Portia Simpson Miller, has just announced that her country will complete the cycle of independence by initiating the process of becoming a republic.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In Canadian history, the cycle of independence has been authored chiefly by the Liberal Party. It was under the Liberals in 1929 that the Statute of Westminster, which eliminated much of Britain's authority to make laws for Canada, was negotiated. It was under Lester Pearson in 1965 that Canada got its own flag. It was under Pierre Trudeau in 1982 that the Constitution was patriated. It's natural that the Liberals should be the party that takes the final step.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">A decoupling from the monarchy would be popular in Quebec, the province where that institution, for obvious reasons, is least popular. The Liberals need to rebuild their old base in Quebec. The monarchy move would help.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The monarchy is most popular with older Canadians, a demographic that the Conservatives have well in hand. But if you're looking to be the party of the future, it's the younger generations to whom you must appeal. Although William and Kate were a big hit in Canada with all age groups, the monarchy is less relevant to the younger set. And it's less relevant to an increasingly multiethnic Canada.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The Liberals could use a severing of royalty ties as a gateway to something bigger – a modernization and reform of our ailing democratic system. Liberals are already talking about reducing the powers that any new leader of their party would have. Many also favour the idea of restructuring the divisions of powers in Ottawa so as to reverse the long-time trend toward one-man rule. But they've yet to come up with good ideas for the creation of a new democracy, one befitting the 21st century, one that could see them dealing with Senate reform or abolition as well.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">To speak of doing away with ties to the monarchy or any grand reform reordering the power structure is difficult from a practical standpoint, in that it would likely require a constitutional amendment supported by the provinces.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But the Liberals should at least give some consideration to the proposal being put forward by their youth wing.

Big oil, foreign intrigue, a grassroots uprising, duelling polls, angry ministers – this one has all the makings of a blockbuster. But the fervour obscures the heart of the matter: whether and under what conditions we should permit supertankers and a bitumen pipeline in one of the last intact temperate coastal rain forests on Earth.</p>",Document GLOB000020120111e81b00007,wwfcan : World Wildlife Fund Canada,A15,683 words,,"<p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">I suspect most Canadians would be surprised that the proposed route of the Northern Gateway pipeline bisects this ecological treasure. Pipeline proponents would rather frame this issue around developing an Asian market for oil sands bitumen – and the allegedly nefarious U.S.-based interests who would prevent us from doing so – than have a science-based debate about the real risks associated with getting it there by this route.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">It's the peculiar Canadian paradox that we're blessed with such natural beauty and abundance that we often fail to value it. Even by our standards, however, the Great Bear is a special place. It's the only habitat in the world for the spirit bear, which is rarer than the giant panda. Humpbacks, orcas and many other species of cetaceans take advantage of this quiet cold ocean to prosper. Eagles are as plentiful as sparrows are in Canada's urban parks. And all five species of Pacific salmon are present, providing the basis for a prosperous fishery.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mercifully, the communities that have been sustained by this wondrous ecosystem don't share our undervaluing of nature. B.C.'s coastal first nations know well that Great Bear's value as a functioning ecosystem dwarfs the tantalizing but fleeting promise of short-term cash from oil revenue. And they know from history what we know from traditional science: that this meticulously interconnected ecosystem is very vulnerable to disruption.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">A toxic event can't be ruled out, even in Enbridge's own estimation. The 1,170-kilometre pipeline would divide the rain forest, crossing countless salmon rivers. At Kitimat, toxic diluted bitumen would be loaded onto supersized tankers. Each year, more than 200 would travel through narrow fjords and into some of the world's most treacherous seas.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">This isn't the first time the Great Bear has been threatened. Twenty-five years ago, it was slated to be clear-cut. But, after years of conflict, a group of unlikely allies found a solution. First nations, forestry companies, NGOs, the Harper and Campbell governments and both Canadian and U.S.-based philanthropists finally came together to create a model of ecosystem management and economic development.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">So the question of whether foreign interests can participate in the National Energy Board hearings is curious. Should we prohibit oil sands companies, the majority of which are foreign-owned and operated? It's also hypocritical, given that the industry and government has spent untold millions to lobby foreign governments, air PR campaigns in foreign markets and solicit foreign direct investment in the oil sands. The message we're sending the world is that you're free to come to Canada to exploit nature, but not to protect it.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In the interests of full disclosure, less than 2 per cent of our revenue came from the U.S. foundations that have been targeted by smear campaigns. We're proud to add that support to the larger contributions we receive from almost 150,000 like-minded Canadians. We're also proud to provide a platform for Canadians who care deeply about conserving nature. Most important, we're transparent about our sources and uses of revenue.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Ultimately, this debate is a red herring designed to distract. The Great Bear is globally significant. If this development were proposed for the Amazon or the Great Barrier Reef, people around the world would engage. These are irreplaceable sites and input from global citizens who care about nature should be welcome.

But he should have known the comment would live on in infamy.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">It was proof that even the most tightly scripted candidate of them all can occasionally blow his lines.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">An embittered Newt Gingrich, seemingly resigned to his fate in New Hampshire but hoping for rebirth in South Carolina, threw the first stone at Mr. Romney on Tuesday. “They apparently looted the companies, left people unemployed and walked off with millions of dollars,” the former Speaker of the House of Representatives said of Mr. Romney and his Bain cohorts. “That's not traditional capitalism.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Texas Governor Rick Perry, also betting it all on the Jan. 21 South Carolina primary, accused Mr. Romney of getting “rich off failures and sticking it to someone else.” Even former Utah governor Jon Huntsman, the most measured of the candidates, could not resist laying into Mr. Romney. But he had a more immediate need. He must break through in New Hampshire to have any hope of continuing on to South Carolina.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“Governor Romney enjoys firing people. I enjoy creating jobs,” Mr. Huntsman said. “It may be that he's slightly out of touch with the economic reality playing out in America right now, and that's a dangerous place to be.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">At a rally at a metalwork factory here, Mr. Romney was forced to spend a rare press conference defending his Bain record, reiterating his assertion that the businesses in which the firm invested on his watch went on to create more than 100,000 net new jobs.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“If [voters] want President Obama and a loss of two million jobs, a decline of median income in America by 10 per cent and people looking at very difficult prospects going forward, they can choose President Obama,” he charged. “But if they want someone who understands how this economy works at the level of job creation – of businesses failing and succeeding – that's what I can bring to the table.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">That pitch may become a tougher sell as voters are exposed to attack ads put out by Mr. Romney's GOP rivals and the Obama campaign that focus on Bain's darker side. Indeed, a group that supports Mr. Gingrich will begin running television ads in South Carolina this week that draw on a scathing documentary about Mr. Romney's Bain legacy. The $3.4-million ad buy is massive by South Carolina standards.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“Nothing mattered but greed,” says the trailer for the film, King of Bain, which calls Mr. Romney a “predatory corporate raider” and “scavenger.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The Palmetto State has a reputation for dirty politics.

Changing the path would mean adding an extra 65 kilometres of pipe and tens of millions of dollars to the bottom line. TransCanada decided to go direct – and cheap – and, in the process, badly miscalculated the environmental conflict its proposed route would generate. And by gambling that it could overcome any protests, TransCanada may now have lost the opportunity altogether.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">I mention this as the National Energy Board hearings into Enbridge's Northern Gateway pipeline get under way near Kitimat, B.C. The project is Canada's own Keystone, and the hostility toward it is being framed in the same grandiose terms: the biggest environmental showdown Canada has witnessed in generations.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">From the outset, concern has centred on Enbridge's plans to take the pipeline across northern B.C. to Kitimat, where gargantuan oil tankers would come to collect the Alberta crude and then take it out through the narrow Douglas Channel before hitting the open ocean and the far-off Asian markets for which the oil is primarily intended.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">This plan has conjured up images of an Exxon Valdez-scale disaster in one of B.C.'s most pristine areas. The channel adjoins the Great Bear Rainforest, a 64,000-square-kilometre stretch of wilderness considered one of the most ecologically sacred on Earth. This is why both aboriginals and environmentalists are preparing such a fierce fight to kill the project. Right now, the odds are in their favour.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Which is why, in the end, a new Gateway route may have to be found. Some believe that it already exists and that Enbridge is bracing for this possibility.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In many ways, building the pipeline so it finishes at Prince Rupert makes more sense, anyway. You already have a world-class port capable of handling large tankers. And once they're loaded, it's a shorter journey to Asia than it will be from Kitimat. And there aren't nearly the same environmental concerns.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Enbridge is obviously aware of this. But it rejected this scenario because the pipeline would have to traverse parts of the Skeena Valley, a particularly complex and technically challenging stretch of terrain. There's a high risk of avalanche throughout this area, and the spring runoffs can often be fierce, churning up river beds in dramatic fashion.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">This type of environment can be particularly troublesome for, say, a pipeline running underground.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The reason we know this is because there's already a pipeline that runs through much of this same area. It's a natural gas line that was built in 1968 and is operated by <span class=""companylink"">Pacific Northern Gas</span>.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Greg Weeres, Pacific's vice-president of operations and engineering, confirmed that the Skeena Valley is taxing mountain topography. Over the years, the gas line has been affected by avalanches and land movement created by runoffs. Access is difficult; crews have to be flown in by helicopter to do repairs.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">That said, the line has been operating for more than 40 years. And it will likely be running for another 40 and beyond that.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Given a challenge, engineers can do almost anything. Advancements in theory and design have addressed many of the problems early pipeline builders in Canada encountered. There's no question we have the minds to construct an oil pipeline to Prince Rupert that would be safe, reliable and efficient.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">It would certainly be more costly for Enbridge. But when you're talking about a project worth tens of billions in revenue, it seems like a small price to pay. I wouldn't be surprised if this is ultimately where the company ends up.

This resulted in the embassy's characterizing the air quality as “unhealthy” or “very unhealthy,” while Beijing reported a “blue sky day” with “good” air quality.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The Chinese government's primary concern was that it should not lose face before its people, that Chinese citizens not be given information that could be used to question the validity of the government's data.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The embassy reported on this conversation in a cable to the State Department. The cable, among the thousands made public by WikiLeaks, makes clear that, in the view of China's Foreign Ministry, the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau should be “the sole authoritative voice for making pronouncements on Beijing's air quality.” It was as though providing information to the Chinese public on the quality of the air they were breathing was somehow interference in China's internal affairs.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Well, China was right about one thing. After the public found out they had been fed misleading information that affected their health, they were confused by the conflicting information available, questioned the official data and launched a social movement, insisting that more complete information be made available.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">That movement has led to success. In November, the China Daily reported that the Ministry of Environmental Protection would solicit public opinion on revised air quality standards, “following widespread calls for the government to provide more information on pollution.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In December, The Wall Street Journal ran an article under the headline, Victory for U.S. Embassy as Beijing Chokes on ‘Heavy Fog.'

Even if that is what Mr. Oliver means, Mr. Harper's is still the more paranoid suggestion.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Harper insists that international environmental groups are working together, targeting individual projects, specifically to undermine our national sovereignty.

That environmentalists defeated the Keystone pipeline that their secret masters wanted, because it would have brought oil to the United States, only so that later they would have the credibility to defeat the Gateway pipeline their secret masters oppose, because it threatens to take Canadian oil elsewhere?</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">That seems unlikely.

And then they had a moment, and then they had a fight, and then eventually they had sex on the desk and the Canadian lobbyists walked in on them in the middle of it, which was kind of hilarious, and you guessed it – yes, it's worse than we imagined: This whole thing is just another crappy American romcom.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">They fell in love, American Big Oil and the Environmental Movement, and apparently they've decided that, as different as they are, they both really hate Canada.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">That's right, Canada.

The line is long, and stretches through the centuries. I know this thanks to a new book, Louise Foxcroft's Calories &amp; Corsets: A History of Dieting Over 2,000 Years, which reveals that our obsession with slimness, and our demonization of fat, has an impressive history. There is no better time to read it than in this month of wretched self-loathing.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">As long as people have looked down at their muffin tops (or their suet crusts) and winced, slimming gurus have lined up to profit from the shame. The first diet bestseller was published in the 15th century, writes Ms. Foxcroft, a British historian of medicine. Three centuries later, the noted gourmet Brillat-Savarin was an early proponent of the low-carb diet, a bit like a Reign of Terror Dr. Atkins. Lose weight, he advised, or “become ugly, and thick, and asthmatic, and finally die in your own melted grease: I shall be there to watch it.” I doubt Weight Watchers will be adopting that slogan any time soon.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Dieting, over the years, has been sold as a moral imperative, a patriotic duty, a Christian obligation. In the mid-20th century you could turn to Pray Your Weight Away or Devotions for Dieters, which included this desperate plea to the Almighty to save a sinner from pie: “I promise not to sit and stuff/But stop when I have had enough. Amen.” It wasn't just that you hated your chunky thighs; God was repulsed, too.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Ms. Foxcroft is very canny about the way health concerns are used to disguise what is essentially an aesthetic distaste for chubbiness. Fat has long been seen as a moral and intellectual failing: “The stupid, heavy, non-intellectual person, or the idiot, is generally fat and flabby,” wrote one 19th-century English doctor.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Not much has changed, even if we now put pillows around our language to guard against offence. “No one wants to be fat,” Tara Parker-Pope wrote recently in a fascinating and much-discussed article in The <span class=""companylink"">New York Times Magazine</span>. “In most modern cultures, to be fat … is to be perceived as weak-willed and lazy.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">At the centre of her piece, The Fat Trap, is a paradox: Dieters, including Ms. Parker-Pope, actually work incredibly hard at losing weight. I doubt the physicists at CERN pay as much attention to numbers as the successful dieters she interviews, who weigh every gram of food that goes into their mouths and calculate every calorie burned on their bikes. But maintaining your new slim figure, as science shows, is very difficult and most people regain their spare tires, unless they're willing to devote every waking moment to banishing thoughts of doughnuts. Losing weight, which is supposed to liberate, instead becomes a prison.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In America alone, the diet industry is worth $40-billion, slightly more than the GDP of Costa Rica. Every person who fails at a diet and embarks on another fattens the pocket of whoever is selling some chimerical notion of beauty. To what end, you have to wonder. For centuries, people in the West have been trying to lose weight – not for reasons of health, but for reasons of status – and it's a losing battle. Maybe it's time to refashion the RyKrisp slogan, and spell it out in chocolate chips: “Nobody loves a fat girl … except herself.”</p>",THE WEEK,,7 January 2012,Column,It's time to shed the tyranny of dieting – losing weight is a losing battle,,ELIZABETH RENZETTI   ,©2012 The Globe and Mail Inc.

Reneging on his promise to stay positive, he unleashed his inner pit bull on Tuesday, going so far as to call the front-runner a “liar.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In a time-tested ritual of American democracy, as Iowa Republicans gathered in 1,774 precincts on Tuesday night, they were fed sales pitches by so-called precinct captains representing each of the candidates. Most captains simply repeated the script sent out by their candidate's campaign headquarters. Others ad libbed.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“Washington has gone off the cliff on debt and we've got to get someone to get us back on path,” insisted Lee Stine, a retired trucker who spoke for Mr. Romney in Precinct 46. “He's electable.

None of the others have.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Surprisingly, Mr. Santorum's precinct captain spoke little of his candidate's stand on social issues, even though that had been the reason for his surging support among Iowa's evangelicals. He called himself a “true conservative warrior.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In a sign of the disarray in the Bachmann and Perry campaigns, no one spoke on their behalf in Precinct 46. Of the 87 votes cast, they each got only three. Mr. Romney won the precinct with 33 votes. Mr. Paul and Mr. Santorum got 19 each.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">With Iowa behind him, Mr. Romney must still work to close the enthusiasm gap that has dogged his candidacy, as grassroots Republicans question his authenticity. He has been haunted by footage from his 2002 gubernatorial run in which he described himself as both “moderate” and “progressive.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Romney took to Fox News early Tuesday to reassure Republicans in Iowa and elsewhere that he is “more conservative than I was 10 years ago.” He also sloughed off Mr. Gingrich's “liar” label, saying the former speaker “must be very angry.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Indeed, Mr. Gingrich has taken the shots against him gracelessly. Though he vowed to refrain from negative attacks on his opponents – pledging to uphold Ronald Reagan's 11th commandment – he has been unable to hide his resentment toward Mr. Romney.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">On Tuesday, Mr. Gingrich accused Mr. Romney of lying when he claimed to have no influence over an organization supporting the ex-governor that spent millions on attack ads against Mr. Gingrich, who led the polls until the final stretch of the campaign.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">If anything, the resurfacing of Mr. Gingrich's snarly side illustrates, as much as any attack ad, why his campaign has been in a freefall. Despite levelling some of the most acid attacks in the annals of U.S. politics, he remains as thin-skinned as a political novice.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The attacks against Mr. Gingrich, while devastating, were hardly nasty by the standards of U.S. political advertising. Yet, the ex-speaker whined about being “Romney-boated” – laughably comparing his plight to that of the “swift-boated” John Kerry in 2004.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Like it or not, negative ads remain the jigsaw in the American political toolkit.

I've heard diplomatic and military officials of very high rank tell me they don't really know how Canada became embroiled. Al-Qaeda had already been banished from Afghanistan by the time we entered the south. Our soldiers were professional, extremely courageous, calmly civilized and never quite sure what had caused them to be there.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">We now have some surprising answers. Analysts with London's Royal United Services Institute, a security think tank, gained un-precedented access to the confidential documents and British official records of the decision by NATO members in 2003 and 2004 to expand the Afghan war. Matthew Willis analyzed the Canadian decision, which was deeply entwined with Britain's. His paper, to be released this month, describes a secret decision by senior Armed Forces officials, without the knowledge of NATO or likely of Canada's prime minister.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“The Canadians and the British,” a senior NATO official told Mr. Willis, “hammered out the whole thing without NATO's assistance, behind closed doors. … We were not aware of the details.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">While Canada was ostensibly fighting with the 42-nation NATO International Stability and Assistance Force, the decision to establish a base in Kandahar, the most dangerous province, was negotiated in London without the knowledge – and against the advice – of the Brussels-based military alliance. NATO had been pressuring General Raymond Henault, then head of the Canadian Forces, to set up a mission in Chaghcharan or Herat.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But Canada's military officials had other ideas – and most were rooted in their experience in Bosnia, five years earlier. They had come to dislike “partnering with the Italians or certain other European nations,” Mr. Willis writes.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The generals also felt that the Bosnia and Kosovo missions hadn't won Canada much international recognition. Those had been real coalitions, and Canada had blended into the background.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“The reason went well beyond a Canadian desire to be patted on the back,” Mr. Willis writes, citing interviews with Canada's military leaders. “It was about being able to make one's voice heard in the political and military fora where mission-defining decisions were being taken, including, not least, plans for the use of Canadian soldiers. It was thus also about improving Canada's ability to exert its influence in accordance with its interests and values.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Prime minister Paul Martin must have known that Canada's troop commitment, just shy of 3,000, was the most it could muster, and may not have been enough for Kandahar. But the generals pressed ahead. Part of it, they told Mr. Willis, was a desire to please Washington.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">He raises the “contentious question why the senior Canadian military leadership, and the defence and foreign affairs departments, persisted in pushing the mission forward. Ostensibly, the military was seeking redemption after a decade of unremarkable performances in unremarkable (read: peacekeeping) theatres; or perhaps it wanted to show the U.S., the Canadian public and other key allies that it really could do combat if called on.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“Implicit and sometimes explicit in all of the above,” he concludes, “is the idea that Canadian planners were pursuing a principally national agenda divorced from the NATO plan and heavily conditioned by beliefs about what would go over well in Washington.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">It is discomforting to think that this war was prolonged beyond the ouster of al-Qaeda in order to further interests of organizational pride and stature. But it was a big part of the decision.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">This may well be the reality of modern war, as we saw in Libya, where a handful of countries forged an ad hoc alliance in confidential meetings far outside of NATO's vision and without all its members – a cafeteria NATO, if you will.

In 2010, long after Mr. McGuinty's Liberals had charged ahead anyway, Malcolm Gladwell used a keynote speech at their policy conference to call the investment a “ludicrous” waste of money. Now, previewing his government-commissioned report on public-service reform, economist Don Drummond has said there “isn't really solid evidence” that it's had value.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">For all that, the Liberals continue to insist that it was the right policy. The argument they make, which is more about intangibles than hard evidence, is quite reasonable. But its backward-looking nature suggests that Mr. Drummond might have a point about the need to reconsider class sizes as the deficit-plagued government embarks on a sweeping cost-cutting exercise.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">When Mr. McGuinty took office in 2003, they argue, the turmoil of the Mike Harris era had left a toxic atmosphere in schools. Teachers, feeling undervalued, were miserable. As a result, students were under-served. A growing number of parents were considering putting their kids into private schools.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The Liberals felt they needed a big gesture to restore faith in the system. And smaller class sizes, popular with teachers and easy for everyone else to grasp, fit the bill. So many hundreds of millions of dollars later, having hired thousands of additional teachers and renovated thousands of classrooms, the government now boasts that in the lowest grades about 90 per cent of classes have 20 students or fewer.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">At the time of implementation, insiders recall, then-education minister Gerard Kennedy assured skeptics within the education sector that it would be worth investing in some goodwill, so the government would be able to get buy-in for less flashy reforms. And in that regard, the strategy seems to have borne results.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Schools are certainly happier places than they were back then. And that broader reform agenda, which among other things involves intervention by teachers to prevent struggling students from slipping through the cracks, has received international recognition for its role in better outcomes for students – including higher standardized test scores and a lower high-school drop-out rate.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But if smaller classes were really just about setting the right conditions, that leads to an obvious question: Is it time to declare mission accomplished, and move on a little?</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">No provincial government could have a better relationship with teachers than Mr. McGuinty's. It's been symbiotic; in return for generous workplace rules and wage increases, teachers have helped the Liberals meet both their policy and political goals, including helping during election campaigns. And understandably, the Liberals are less than eager to jeopardize that.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But if all that goodwill is real, then there should be some willingness to accept that the province's current financial challenges – a $16-billion deficit and slow economic growth and potential credit-rating downgrades – require some sacrifice. And it should at least be possible to consider, if not a return to Harris-era class sizes, whether caps and targets could safely be raised a little from where they are now.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Of course, there's another reason why Mr. Drummond's advice about class sizes – like that of others before him – is likely to be rejected.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">That argument about buying goodwill is the only one that's been made in private. Publicly, the Liberals have been much less nuanced, holding up class sizes as the main cause of students' improved results. It wasn't just presented as a means to an end; it was their signature education policy, helping them get elected and re-elected.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Having gone down that route, it would be very difficult politically to concede that it might not be quite so essential a policy after all. In retrospect, had the Liberals known the financial crunch to come, perhaps they would've been less eager to stake their reputations to a largely symbolic gesture.</p>",EDUCATION,,9 January 2012,Column,Time for McGuinty to reconsider class sizes,,ADAM RADWANSKI   ,©2012 The Globe and Mail Inc.

In December, another Chinese firm, Sinopec, closed a $2.2-billion deal for <span class=""companylink"">Daylight Energy Ltd</span>.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">This is new and will have a lasting impact. Chinese firms aren't just buying stakes, they're buying whole operations. It's a new phase of China's step-by-step Canada strategy. It will change not just the oil patch but Canada's foreign policy. And a game of international energy politics is afoot in Canada's West.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">These deals are different because Canadians will see how Chinese firms operate, not just invest. They're state-controlled companies, with executives such as Mr. Jiang who have moved among the Communist Party, government and big oil. Some fears, though not all, can now be tested; such as suggestions they will flout environmental or labour standards. They're about to be Canadian employers, and may eventually be important ones.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">It's also a step in a strategy that's not complete. The Chinese have tested the waters in Canada for six years, first with small deals that didn't require government approval, then bigger deals that did, but only for part-ownership. Now it's full ownership.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But after $2-billion deals, a $10-billion deal for a Canadian energy giant is surely next, though perhaps not for a few years.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“The question is whether the political appetite would be there,” said Goldy Hyder, general manager of <span class=""companylink"">Hill &amp; Knowlton</span> in Ottawa, and a lobbyist for Canadian and Chinese clients on big energy deals. “And whether companies have done the right thing to get the social licence.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In other words, Canadians will have to be convinced that Chinese state companies should be allowed to own big chunks of their natural resources, and not fear Beijing's influence in Canada, or rapacious exploitation of the resource to fuel Chinese industry, or bad corporate behaviour. The public image of China and Chinese companies will matter.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">What does China want? There's no pipeline to the West Coast, so Alberta bitumen can't be shipped to China, yet. In part, Chinese companies are making a financial investment.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But China is also obsessed with energy security. It sees meeting the rapidly rising energy demands of its industry as key to sustaining its economic growth.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">China wants technology to help extract their own hard-to-reach resources, especially natural gas. But it also wants diverse imports as protection against disruptions in supply from conflict or politics. It's building pipelines, in part to ensure that less of its supply comes through the narrow Strait of Malacca, which, in theory, could be choked off by conflict or even piracy.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">And resource investments around the world indicate China doesn't want to rely on buying products on the markets. It wants to own. The Chinese companies expect there will eventually be pipelines to the West Coast that will allow shipments across the Pacific.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">That's where the oil sands is wedged between superpowers. The United States also worries about energy security. It viewed the oil sands as captive supply, because the direction of the pipelines makes it the only export destination now. A West Coast pipeline would make that uncertain.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">It's still years away: hearings on the proposed Northern Gateway oil pipeline to the B.C. Coast start next week, but will take at least two years. But Stephen Harper has already rattled the sword.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">After U.S. President Barack Obama delayed a decision on the Keystone XL pipeline extension to the U.S. Gulf Coast, Mr. Harper revealed in a year-end interview with CTV that he had a “tough luck” response for Americans who assured him it would eventually be approved, and Canada could continue to sell all of its oil there.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“I said, ‘Yeah we'd love to,' but I think the problem is now that we're on a different track,” he said.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Mr. Harper has some cards with China, too. He has sent signals that state-owned Chinese business can be owners in Canada, which might give him some points as he seeks things like an investment protection agreement from Beijing. And the biggest deals are still in the future.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">If that happens, Chinese firms that are major Canadian employers, backed by an owner that is the government of a major trading partner, will only increase the pressure for a West Coast pipeline. And energy sales will speed the shift of Canadian priorities across the Pacific.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Campbell Clark writes about foreign affairs from Ottawa</p>",BIG OIL,,5 January 2012,Column,China's oil sands deal in Alberta will have lasting impact,i13 : Crude Oil/Natural Gas | i1 : Energy | i1300005 : Support Activities for Oil/Gas,CAMPBELL CLARK   ,©2012 The Globe and Mail Inc.

There are just schools on reserves run by band councils. Many of those isolated schools are staffed by inexperienced teachers, who are often paid less than those who teach in public schools. They work in inadequate buildings that have no computers or libraries, but plenty of mould. They teach children who desperately need above-average, not grossly below-average, support.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">“In time, some will be lost to themselves, to their families and communities, and to this country,” the report concludes.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Many chiefs, especially younger ones just arriving on the scene, recognize that ending generations of poverty, ill health and joblessness on reserves begins with properly educating this generation of students.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In Nova Scotia, British Columbia and elsewhere, reserves are banding together to create native school boards that, with the help of provincial governments, pool resources, set standards and adopt a common curriculum that teaches native language and culture along with math, science and language arts. While fewer than half of native students on reserves graduate from high school nationally, the figure for Mi'kmaw students in Nova Scotia – most of whom attend a combination of reserve and provincial schools – is over 70 per cent.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The Senate report proposes building on that model with legislation that would encourage – but not compel – native leaders across the country to co-operate in establishing school boards and even the native equivalent of education ministries, with federal education funding flowing through the new authorities.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Another report, jointly commissioned by the Assembly of First Nations and the government, from a panel chaired by YMCA president Scott Haldane, is expected to provide specifics on how a national program to create native school boards might work.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">That report arrives in early February, not long after Prime Minister Stephen Harper meets with native chiefs in Ottawa to discuss education and other matters.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The thinking is that the summit, the two reports and the growing co-operation between the chiefs and the Conservatives – on the education issue, if nothing else – could provide sufficient impetus for a First Nations Education Act that most chiefs would support. If all goes well, Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Duncan could present the bill to the House during the fall session.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Money, of course, will be the key. For 15 years, first nations education funding has grown at a rate of 2 per cent annually, far below the increases for provincial schools. Mr. Harper has let it be known that he is willing to put money into a first-nations education system that is effective and accountable, which is why the Tories are attracted to the idea of school boards.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">None of this will be easy. This country has a horrible history of using education to undermine native culture, so we should expect a lot of resistance to any education act, even if some chiefs do endorse it.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Still, the Conservatives have gone much farther down this path than anyone would have predicted.

Mr. Havel, an absurdist playwright and eloquent essayist who spent years in jail under a Soviet-backed Communist regime, spoke about the need to “live within the truth” as an “elementary starting point” for opposing totalitarianism. Dissent, he wrote, was in the “service of truth, the truthful life and the attempt to make for the genuine aims of life.” Mr. Havel served truth when to do so was a dangerous occupation, while the Canadian Mr. Skvorecky was creating a lasting testament to the genuine aims of life.</p>",SKVORECKY / AND HAVEL,,4 January 2012,Editorial,Engineers of human freedom,i4753 : Book Publishing | i475 : Printing/Publishing | imed : Media | ipubl : Publishing,,©2012 The Globe and Mail Inc.

The Liberal Party of Canada is right when it says it needs “radical change.” Today's Liberals are essentially the party of Toronto's Annex class, and not much else. Unless they can resuscitate themselves, the Conservatives will run Canada until the seas run dry. (The NDP will never run Canada. Trust me on this.)</p>",Document GLOB000020120112e81c0002j,,A13,750 words,,"<p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Sadly, radical change is not in sight – not this weekend, as the party's tattered remnants gather in Ottawa to map out their Road to Renewal – and not any time soon. No party that's ready to elect Sheila Copps as president is sincerely interested in renewal.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Then there's the matter of what they stand for. “The Liberals have shown they're only capable of coming up with old ideas, tired ideas and bad ideas,” says a cynical friend, and on the evidence, he's right. As the Western world is buffeted by economic storms, rising inequality and unsustainable entitlements, the Liberals are preparing to debate such urgent matters as legalizing marijuana, bringing back the Wheat Board, expanding hate-propaganda laws to include gender hatred, and abolishing the monarchy (a task that's almost constitutionally impossible).</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">These ideas – so slight, so silly and so distracting – are a sign of intellectual exhaustion. Even Liberals know that, if they want to reconnect with the “soul” of Canada, as one party stalwart put it, they'll have to come up with something better.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">But maybe you can't blame them too much. The progressive left is floundering everywhere. Their best ideas are used up. The postwar institutions they worked so successfully to build are in big trouble. And they have no idea what to do about it.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">As Francis Fukuyama writes in a powerful new essay, The Future of History, “it has been several decades since anyone on the left has been able to articulate, first, a coherent analysis of what happens to the structure of advanced societies as they undergo economic change and, second, a realistic agenda that has any hope of protecting a middle-class society.”</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The liberal democracies are at the end of the welfare-state road, and all of them are looking for a map. Their aging demographics mean that entitlement spending is exploding just as economic growth has slowed dramatically. Raising taxes on the rich won't solve this problem.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Meantime, our barnacle-encrusted public institutions have shown they are too expensive, too unresponsive, too inflexible and too captive to their own interest groups to deliver services in effective and efficient ways. Both health care and public education are weighed down by excessive bureaucracy, lack of competition and rule-bound work practices that belong to the age of the medieval guilds.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Fixing the public sector will be among the top priorities of governments for the next generation. But as Mr. Fukuyama points out, the mainstream left remains obsessed with defending the status quo. “Thus, when existing social democratic parties come to power, they no longer aspire to be more than custodians of a welfare state that was created decades ago.” The Liberals also need to stop assuming that most Canadians trust and respect the wisdom of government as much as they do. Hint: They don't.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The trouble with the Liberals is, they know what they're against (anything attached to Stephen Harper) but have no idea what they're for. Although the age of ever-expanding entitlements is at an end, they can't help themselves from thinking up some more. The worst part is that, despite their accusations that Mr. Harper is a dangerous right-wing radical, on most substantive matters (such as fiscal policy, immigration policy and free trade), they basically agree.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The deeper question posed by Mr. Fukuyama is whether liberal democracy can survive the decline of the middle class. Hardly anyone predicted that technology and globalization would have such dramatically disparate effects – enriching some people, dislocating so many others. It's these factors, rather than Wall Street robber-bankers, that are driving the growth in inequality.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">How might society mitigate these flaws in capitalism in ways that are politically acceptable? Perhaps the Liberals could get around to thinking about this one of these days. I'd like them to prove my cynical friend wrong. I'd like the Tories not to be the only game in town.</p>",CANADIAN POLITICS,,12 January 2012,Comment Column,"Let's face it, the Liberals are out of gas",,MARGARET WENTE   ,©2012 The Globe and Mail Inc.

Mr. Kim and Mr. Havel were dramatic contrasts in style of governance, liberality of mind and openness to new thinking, but they can also serve as case studies of the myopic and deadening education of the technocrat as opposed to the expansive and liberating education of the playwright-essayist.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Admittedly, being a technocrat is not a bad thing; the governments of Greece and Italy have replaced their respective prime ministers, George Papandreou and Silvio Berlusconi, with technocrats Lucas Papademos and Mario Monti. But the latter are economists and not party functionaries like Mr. Kim, who was adept enough to charm former U.S. secretary of state Madeleine Albright and others with a self-deprecating manner and a familiarity with pop culture, all the while remaining a dangerous political fantasist.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">A liberal arts education is not an automatic guarantor of an emancipated intellect or an enlightened sensibility. You have to work at it. In fact, Mr. Havel was prevented from studying the humanities at university for political reasons, an early indicator for him that the authorities appreciated the subversive potential of such an education. But the capacity of a writer and political thinker like Mr. Havel to usher in a new and bloodless era by symbolizing the conscience of freedom-enamoured Czechs would be unthinkable were it not for his exposure to a tradition of learning that is not subservient to a prevailing political ideology, that is deeply humanist in its core, steeped in the writings of extraterritorial thinkers not held hostage to the orthodoxy of the moment.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">North Korea's Dear Leader may have been an obsessive devotee of Hollywood B movies, thereby giving him a mite of aesthetic relief from the grey madness of Pyongyang, but Mr. Havel brought down an oppressive system through his art and witness.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">So, when next a young sociology undergraduate is critiqued in the manner of Peter Shaffer's Austrian emperor in Amadeus, who observes to a puzzled Mozart that his just-debuted work has “too many notes,” the student might respond that there are as many sociologists as it takes to keep us free.</p>",LIBERAL ARTS EDUCATION,,2 January 2012,Comment,Too many sociologists?

As a result, same-sex marriage cannot be diminished or sent to the back of the bus by this party or that party. It is the law of Canada, from here on to be staunchly defended by the government of Canada. (Including the Justice Department.)</p>",Document GLOB000020120114e81e0000t,cndj : Department of Justice Canada,F8,380 words,,"<p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Justice Minister Rob Nicholson did the right and necessary thing in making absolutely clear that gay marriages of foreigners in Canada are legal – including the thousands already married here, and those who may marry in the future. Also important, he said he understood the pain and confusion that have been caused. And he will not let legal technicalities, even long-standing legal principles, whether residency requirements or the “law of domicile,” stand in the way.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The message, then, is not that gay marriage has to fit into the pre-existing framework of laws, but that the legal framework has to be made to fit gay marriage.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">The Justice Department, for reasons still obscure, did not understand this when it argued, in a lesbian divorce case, that the marriage itself did not exist because, in the places the two women came from (Florida and England), gay marriage was not legal. Although Mr. Nicholson blamed a “legislative gap” left by the Liberal prime minister Paul Martin, who rewrote the Civil Marriage Act to include same-sex marriage, the Justice Department's response to that gap was grossly unfair and, in its effect, discriminatory. (The department, not Mr. Martin, caused the pain and confusion.)</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Of course, gay marriage didn't fit the existing international framework. Most countries have never contemplated gay marriage. Some observers in the legal community actually argued that the “law of domicile” (the ability to marry where one lives) and one-year residency requirements for divorce treat heterosexuals and homosexuals equally. Mr. Nicholson, thankfully, did not ignore the real-world context that made nonsense of this mechanistic view of equality.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">In Canada, more sturdily than ever after this topsy-turvy week, gay marriage is the law of the land.</p>",SAME-SEX MARRIAGE,,14 January 2012,Editorial,A staunch defence of a principle,,,©2012 The Globe and Mail Inc.

Does it matter if the party survives? Few would say so with much passion, but I think it does matter. Failing that, we'll be left with ideologues of the left and right. Liberals, by contrast, have few principles beyond survival and power, which at least makes for a keen attention to the public good.</p>",Document GLOB000020120106e8160001g,,A13,618 words,,"<p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">A significant part of the Liberal future will be decided at the convention. This has nothing to do with policy. These proposals are the usual mix of motherhood and political correctness (save a call for legalized marijuana), tax-and-spend big government, and a country run out of Ottawa. No, the big question, going to the survival of the party, is a constitutional one: How will the next leader be chosen?</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Why should this matter? Because the party establishment proposal is for a new system looking a whole lot like the American primaries that crowd our TV screens these days.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">To get a feel for it, one need only look south. Just about anyone could sign up, for free and at the last minute, to get a vote for the new Liberal leader. Regional primaries would be held over a period of weeks (as in the U.S., even culminating in a Super Saturday) to generate a sense of drama and regional identity.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">National Liberal president Alfred Apps says this would “reconnect Liberalism with millions of disaffected and disengaged Canadians,” and be an opportunity for more unknown candidates.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">Well, maybe. It's a nice dream. But it's not without its shadows. One need only look at the current Republican primary circus to see some of them.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">An obvious problem is that this system calls for the party leader to be chosen mostly by those who know very little about the person. And one need not believe that these newbies would linger to help the new person. The party is famous for the thousands of “instant Liberals” who show up to support this or that ethnic or religious candidate, never to be seen again.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">A second worrying possibility is turnout. A maxim of politics is that one books a smaller hall for a meeting than the numbers expected to give a sense of crowd and excitement. But this primary “hall” is in the millions. What if no one showed up or cared enough about the leadership to take part? Or what if mainly special interests showed up?</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">There's also the matter of knowledge. Proper assessment of candidates takes time and experience. Indeed, that's why we've had political parties until now.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">And forgive a political science thing: The primary process would bring a party leader even closer to the stature of the U.S. president, beholden only to the people (which means to no one) and not to the party, a potential prime minister all-powerful. At least the president has to deal with Congress rather than a supine parliamentary majority.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">I think the Liberals would be better off looking at Resolution 18 submitted by the Ontario Liberal Party. This calls for a Renewal Commission (like the Reform Commission of 1985) that would take a thoughtful look at this primary concept and other ideas. This is too important for the precipitous action now proposed.</p><p class=""articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"">There's no hurry on this. The next election will not be until 2015. Study the possibilities (including the old, delegated convention) throughout 2012, adopt a system in 2013, choose a leader in 2014 and go into the election with momentum. Makes more sense.</p>",LIBERAL CONVENTION,,6 January 2012,Comment,Primaries aren't the way to go,,GORDON GIBSON   ,©2012 The Globe and Mail Inc.
