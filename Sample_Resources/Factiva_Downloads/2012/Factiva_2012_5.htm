<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beans are a nutritional gold mine as well as being inexpensive and easy to cook. Featured in many regional cuisines, they are high in fibre, protein and minerals, and low in fat. During this time of year, when you're tired of all the root vegetables and kale, you can bring originality back into your diet with beans.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The following recipes allow you to replace cooked beans with canned, but using home-cooked adds much more flavour to the dish. You can still cook your own in the final recipe, where I used canned beans. I often cook twice as much as I want and then freeze half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beans need to be soaked before cooking but you can speed up the process with the quick-soak method. Place beans in water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to boil, boil for 2 minutes. Cover and let pot sit for 1 hour. Drain and rinse well. If you are organized, soak them overnight. Never salt beans until you're finished cooking, because it toughens them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LIMA BEANS ITALIAN STYLE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Serve as a side dish with sautéed spicy pork or combine with pasta for a main course. I sometimes process them into a purée and serve as a side with meat or chicken. You can use fava or broad beans too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Prep Time: 1 hour 15 minutes including soaking time</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Cooking Time: 1 hour 15 minutes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Ready In: 2½ hours</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ingredients</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2 cups dried large lima or broad beans</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 lemon cut in quarters</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 bay leaf</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 teaspoon dried thyme</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• To finish</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Method</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cover lima beans with water by 2 inches in a pot. Bring to boil over high heat. Boil for 2 minutes then remove from heat, cover and let sit for one hour. Drain well and rinse beans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Place beans back into pot; add lemon, garlic, onion, bay leaves and thyme. Cover with water by an inch and bring to boil. Cover pot, reduce heat and simmer beans until tender, about 1 hour. Drain beans, reserving liquid, and discard flavourings except for garlic cloves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heat oil in sauté pan on medium heat. Add onions and sauté for 2 minutes. Add garlic, chili and prosciutto and sauté until onions are quite soft, another 5 minutes. Add beans and toss in oil and flavourings. Add 1½ cups reserved bean cooking liquid and reserved whole garlic cloves (peeled).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bring to a boil over high heat and cook for 5 minutes or until beans have a thick sauce. Season well with salt and pepper. Stir in parsley. Serves 6.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SPICY VEGETARIAN HARIRA</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harira is the thick, wholesome Moroccan soup eaten at sundown on Ramadan and it includes lamb, sometimes chicken, spices and herbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is my much quicker vegetarian version, lighter but still full flavoured. Soak the chickpeas overnight so they cook in the time available or use a drained can stirred in 20 minutes before the end of cooking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the soup gets too thick, add a little extra water, as needed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You remember peak oil – it's history, right?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everything has changed so fast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, the world was facing an intractable oil crisis. “By 2012, surplus oil production capacity could entirely disappear,” the U.S. Defence Department said in a major report. “A severe energy crunch is inevitable without a massive expansion of production and refining capacity.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now we're told that the world is awash in oil. Deepwater production from the Gulf of Mexico and offshore Brazil is soaring. New “elephant” fields have been discovered off Ghana and possibly Angola. Meanwhile, hydrofracking technology is liberating hundreds of thousands of barrels a day from “tight” shale oil formations in North Dakota and Texas, with more coming on line from Colorado, Wyoming, even Ohio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his new book The Quest: Energy, Security and the Remaking of the Modern World, Pulitzer-winning energy analyst Daniel Yergin declares that the latest version of the peak oil thesis is just more handwringing by long-discredited Malthusians. Higher prices and new technologies will bring vast quantities of new oil to market. “The world has decades of further production growth before flattening out into a plateau – perhaps some time around mid-century.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whew, that was close. Glad we don't have to worry about that problem any more!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's a nagging issue: Oil prices remain stubbornly high. The North American benchmark price of West Texas Intermediate is hovering around $100 a barrel. The world benchmark price for Brent crude is currently about $110. Sure, the possibility of war with Iran has created a risk premium that explains a portion of this high price. But the fact remains that oil has been trading around $100 a barrel for about a year, despite chronic weakness in the world economy and on-again, off-again concerns about Iran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, as University of California energy economist James Hamilton shows in a new paper, except for brief periods in the late 1970s, early 1980s and in 2008, oil is far costlier in constant dollars today than at any time since the beginning of the modern oil age in the 19th century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, in a commentary in the scientific journal Nature, James Murray of the University of Washington and David King, former chief scientific adviser to the British government, showed how slack in global oil markets has largely vanished. Since 2005, when oil was about $50 a barrel, global conventional crude production, which is about 80 per cent of total crude supply, has stayed roughly constant at around 74 million barrels a day – despite average annual gains of 15 per cent in price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unconventional sources of oil – from Canada's oil sands and U.S. shale oil, from biofuels and from natural gas production – boosted total liquids output to about 89 million barrels a day in 2011. But these unconventional sources are very expensive, averaging between $50 and $90 a barrel. Professors Murray and King show that since 2005, world oil supply has become far less responsive to increasing demand – in econo-speak, its price elasticity has fallen sharply. “As a result,” they write, “prices swing wildly in response to small changes in demand.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil optimists like Mr. Yergin are good at creating straw men. For instance, they often claim that analysts concerned about oil supply believe the world will soon run out. But no one makes that claim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, concerned analysts usually point to two basic facts. First, each year, the world's mature conventional fields produce about four million barrels a day less oil than the previous year, a gap that has to be filled just to keep global output constant. In only five years, that gap grows to 20 million barrels a day of production – equivalent to twice Saudi Arabia's output, which is mammoth. Second, the world's cheap and easy-to-get oil is disappearing fast. So, on average, each additional barrel requires more work, more complex technology, more environmental risk to get and refine than the last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These two facts mean that humankind will have to invest staggering resources – many trillions of dollars – to find and produce new oil if global output is to grow steadily for decades into the future. The International Energy Agency in Paris and other analysts have been warning for years that current investment isn't nearly enough to ensure such a supply. The result is likely to be a critical supply crunch, perhaps within this decade, which could cripple global economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The petroleum economist Chris Skrebowski defines peak oil as the point at which “the cost of incremental supply exceeds the price economies can pay without destroying growth.” We're likely much closer to that kind of peak than most people, including Mr. Yergin, acknowledge.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This country is going to look so very different 20 years from now – a lot more grey hair, or no hair. Good for Prime Minister Stephen Harper for raising the tough challenges now. The opposition parties act as if he wanted to cast millions of seniors into penury. They would surely toss him into political oblivion if he did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changing demographics, obvious to the point of staring many of us in the face – each morning in the mirror – will oblige this country to do a wide-ranging examination of its social support systems. And more than that, of its wealth-generating capacity, to pay for the supports. Mr. Harper, speaking in Davos last week, raised both sides of the coin: the difficulties of paying for Old Age Security on the one hand, and the need to improve the country's performance in science and technology, and to expand trade, on the other.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenges of a greying society lend themselves to fear-mongering. Interim Liberal Leader Bob Rae accused Mr. Harper of “a politics of abandonment, because he's abandoning future generations of seniors.” NDP MP Chris Charlton said the government is “talking about gutting the OAS.” Mr. Harper sought to dampen any damage from his open-ended statements in Davos, saying he has no plans to cut transfers to individuals or provinces. A disproportionate part of his support is from older Canadians; he is unlikely to blow that support to smithereens by taking an axe to the OAS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the moment, 7.5 million Canadians are left without private workplace pensions, and any changes to the pension system seem frightening. The government is moving to fill that gap by allowing for pooled retirement pension plans focused on small business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is dealing from a position of relative strength at the moment, and has time to phase in changes before 2030, when 9.3 million Canadians will receive the OAS, at a cost of $108-billion, funded from general tax revenues – up from 4.7 million people and $36.5-billion (in 2010). The challenge of ensuring that the retirement-income system and other supports are on a secure footing for the next generation is one that no government can avoid.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Canada negotiated its free-trade agreement with the United States more than two decades ago, proponents insisted it would improve Canada's productivity.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal would force Canadian companies to be more competitive. Foreign-owned multinationals would give their Canadian affiliates (branch plants) “world product mandates” to specialize in one or two product lines. Companies would get bigger, stronger and more productive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It didn't happen, or at least not to the extent proponents believed. The honest among them have admitted that whatever other gains that deal brought, it did not improve Canada's productivity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That improvement has eluded a series of federal governments. Now, Stephen Harper's Conservatives, with a majority in Parliament, are going to give it another try. We can only hope that these efforts succeed, because the flip side of the debate about the affordability of social programs for an aging population – a debate already off to an ill-focused, raucous start over Old Age Security – is how to make the economy more competitive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With fewer people working to support more who are retired, those who are working have to be more productive, or the revenues won't be there. Every Western industrialized country faces this dilemma, and few have found any lasting answers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By one count, the federal government has – count 'em – more than 100 programs, institutes and regional development agencies to support business. That figure doesn't include an array of tax incentives, the largest of which is the Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&amp;ED) tax credit. All together, these business programs cost $6.44-billion in the fiscal year 2010-2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Head-scratchers in Ottawa have long wondered about these programs, to which every government wants to add more. They are certainly costly and numerous, but they don't seem to have achieved the bang for the buck, at least not judging by the amount of innovation they spark. And innovation lies at the core of enhanced productivity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What perplexes policy-makers further is that for several decades, governments have adopted many of the policies that textbooks suggest should enhance productivity. They've run (until recently) intelligent fiscal policies, lowered taxes, tried to reduce regulations, entered into liberalized trade deals, privatized Crown corporations, invested in research and skills training – and yet productivity remains low by international standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many smart people have thrown their energies into recommending ways of improving productivity. Three reports to the Harper government, chaired respectively by Red Wilson, Howard Alper and Tom Jenkins, have had a go, and now it would appear the government is prepared to act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Jenkins report, a group chaired by the head of <span class="companylink">Open Text Corp</span>., that also included University of Toronto president David Naylor, provided a thorough, accessible and somewhat alarming overview of Canada's record. Of 31 OECD countries, Canada stood 18th for business expenditure on research and development as a share of GDP. No Canadian province was above the OECD average, although Quebec came close. The prairie provinces and Atlantic Canada were miles behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having appointed the Jenkins group, the Harper government has apparently taken its suggestions to heart. So in the next budget, there will likely be an Innovation Council to try to co-ordinate programs better. The SR&amp;ED tax credit program will be modified and shrunk with some funds being spent on direct grants. The National Research Council will be shaken up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will all this do any good? The Harper government, like its predecessors, is sufficiently dismayed by lagging productivity that it is willing to shuffle programs around and create new structures. Whether government programs are at the heart of the problem is doubtful, given that the R&amp;D tax credits have been among the most generous in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada has industries that just don't do much research and development, of which the resource extractive ones, especially oil and gas, are at the top of the list. The economy has never fully recovered from the collapse of Nortel, which was the largest private-sector generator of R&amp;D in Canada. Now, Research In Motion, the newest flagship for high-tech R&amp;D, is staggering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Creative mid-sized Canadian firms are often sold to foreign interests. They become cogs in a big corporate machine that tends to do the bulk of its research in the home country, the classic example being <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, which sells its products everywhere in Canada, sucks up talent from Canadian universities, especially Waterloo, but does no serious R&amp;D in Canada.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Israel this week, Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird declared it would be a lot easier for the Harper government to go along with criticisms of Israel if it wanted to win votes. Then a poll found half of Canadians think the government has struck the right balance on the Middle East.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It means the government has plenty of political room in which to keep up a staunch pro-Israel policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's little doubt Stephen Harper's government has taken a decidedly more pro-Israel tone. Mr. Baird underlined it in his speech Monday, saying Israel has no better friend than Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many assumed for years that Canadians want their government to stay neutral on Mideast issues. So this new poll, given the government's shift in tone, seems to turn that on its head.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Environics Institute poll found 48 per cent think the Harper government's policy on Israeli-Palestinian issues “strikes the right balance.” Another 23 per cent said it is too pro-Israel, 3 per cent said it is too pro-Palestinian, and 27 per cent didn't know.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results are a surprise to some who have been involved in Canada's Middle East policy. Past polls, like a 2007 survey sponsored by the BBC, have found more Canadians have a negative view of Israel than a positive one. They believed something like neutrality was the public will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Was the assumption wrong? Have views changed?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notably, the answer Canadians have given to the question in the Environics Institute poll hasn't changed much in recent years. Forty-nine per cent thought prime minister Jean Chrétien's Liberals struck the right balance back in 2001. Keith Neuman, executive director of the Environics Institute, said the public hasn't changed its assessment as the Conservative government changed policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why not? Depends who you ask. Shimon Fogel, CEO of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, says most Canadians never thought “balanced” meant never taking sides, as many in the bureaucracy and elites did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don't think Canadians were ever interested in us being neutral. But they are interested in us having a balanced, thoughtful approach,” he said. “Canadians were not necessarily aware or understanding of what a balanced approach looks like. In an earlier time, it was interchangeable with neutral – we praise one thing, we criticize the other.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians, he argued, like the sense their government speaks directly in a dysfunctional debate. But Ottawa retains the level of balance they want, he said – supporting negotiations toward a two-state solution and offering aid to the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other side, Rula Odeh, a board member of the National Council on Canada-Arab Relations, thinks Canadians just don't know the government's positions are out of step with theirs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She noted the same poll found Canadians disagree with the government on a specific policy: 36 per cent supported the Palestinian bid to be recognized as a state by the UN, while 11 per cent opposed it. The government has vocally criticized the bid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Neuman suggests the fact 53 per cent had no opinion on that question is a clue to the real bottom line. A small proportion feel directly invested in the issue, but most don't follow the twists of Canadian policy, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another pollster, who declined to be named because his surveys on the issue are confidential, said it's more than that. Most Canadians turn off. It's complicated and intractable in their eyes, and they don't have high hopes for a solution, he said: “Most don't see a white hat in that fight.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The politicians will watch for the small numbers who are intensely interested, and what ridings they live in, particularly in the Jewish community and among some Muslim-Canadians, and some others. But there's little broad reaction in public opinion. “It suggests the government has some latitude,” Mr. Neuman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upshot is that the Harper government has political space for its staunchly pro-Israel foreign policy. They aren't running into a brick wall of public opinion, far from it. They have political leeway. You can bet they already knew that.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most often-repeated piece of investing advice of the past couple of years has to be “buy blue-chip dividend stocks.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hey, I've raised this idea a few dozen times myself. But now it's time to take stock, so to speak. Dividend payers have in many cases soared in price and, while they still offer a good flow of dividend income, they're not the bargain they once were.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-blue-chip dividend stocks are a different story. In many cases, they offer high yields, the opportunity for capital gains and, oh yes, higher risk. Many of these companies represent the evolution of income trusts, which for the most part no longer exist in their old structure as a business passing along virtually all of its earnings to shareholders each month. They're now corporations paying dividends that in many cases generate yields far in excess of what the blue chips offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When most people think dividend stocks, they think of banks, pipelines, utilities, telecoms,” said Leslie Lundquist, manager of the Bissett Canadian High Dividend Fund. “We have a small component in those types of names, but what we have more of are smaller companies that in many cases used to be income trusts. We're finding better value in some of those.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's a quick highlights package from the blue chip dividend world: <span class="companylink">Enbridge Inc</span>., up 30 per cent in the 12 months to mid-week; <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span>, up 19 per cent; <span class="companylink">Telus Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">BCE Inc</span>., up 14 and 12 per cent, respectively; and, <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>., up 13 per cent. Meantime, the S&amp;P/TSX 60 index of big companies (included non dividend payers) was off 9 per cent. Rising share prices mean falling dividend yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, while BCE, an outlier, yields 5 per cent or so, most other top dividend performers are between 1 and 4 per cent. That's not bad when compared with a 1.8-per-cent yield on a 10-year Government of Canada bond. But some of the former trusts in Ms. Lundquist's portfolio beat that by far. Examples include:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morneau Shepell Inc</span>. (MSI)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's largest domestically owned pension and benefits outsourcing firm offers a dividend yield just above 7 per cent. Ms. Lundquist said Morneau's share price has been depressed by concerns about debt levels, but this is a company that tends to keep its customers through economic ups and downs. “We think that dividend yield is very sustainable, and we think there's still upside in the price”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Medical Facilities Corp</span>. (DR) This company runs private surgical hospitals in the United States, which raises concerns ranging from health care reform to legal liability. “But, really, this has been a remarkably stable business and has made all its distribution payments,” she said. Investor trepidation about this stock is evident in the 9.3-per-cent yield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Zargon Oil &amp; Gas Ltd</span>. (ZAR) Zargon reported disappointing results in 2011 as a result of cost control issues and flooding on a property, Ms.Lundquist said. Add a dividend cut to the picture and you get a share price that was down more than 50 per cent at its worst last year. “In speaking with management there, we're confident they've identified what went wrong, and recent results have given us some encouragement.” Zargon's yield is about 8 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investing in smaller companies that lack the franchises of big blue chips means more risk of losing money and having your dividend cut or suspended. Ms. Lundquist said these companies can be more tied to economic cycles, and they lack much of a following with investors. “But at the same time,” she added, “we think they offer a good risk-return tradeoff.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, she said that mixing blue chips and smaller dividend payers has in the case of her fund produced less risk than the S&amp;P/TSX composite index. One measure of a fund's tendency to bounce around in price is called beta. The S&amp;P/TSX composite index has a beta of 1.0, while Bissett Canadian High Dividend comes in at a comparatively low 0.8. Last year, the fund lost 1 per cent, while the composite index fell 8.7 per cent with dividends factored in. The value of owning big blue chip dividend stocks was clear last year, when they massively outperformed the overall market. These stocks are foundational investments, but some of them are no bargain at the moment. You have alternatives.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Brothers Ford are peeved at Karen Stintz, again.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been on and off tensions between the Fords and the North Toronto councillor for some time. Now, Councillor Doug Ford says he wants a big shakeup at the <span class="companylink">Toronto Transit Commission</span>, which Ms. Stintz chairs. Asked on Wednesday whether she has a future as chair, he declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Rob Ford, for his part, was asked about his differences with Ms. Stintz when he faced reporters at a Scarborough news conference Wednesday afternoon. She has questioned a costly provincial plan to put a light rapid transit line underground through the eastern stretches of Eglinton Avenue. He wants it underground all the way, cost be damned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think the commission spoke loud and clear yesterday,” he said. He was referring to a vote of the commission on Tuesday that overruled Ms. Stintz. She was seeking a report from the TTC that might have confirmed her doubts about putting LRT vehicles underground for most of the Eglinton line, instead of underground in the centre of the city and on the surface in the less-dense eastern suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ford-friendly councillors on the commission voted her down. Ms. Stintz was clearly annoyed. Now the talk around city hall is that the Fords may soon oust her from the TTC. That would be unfortunate, to say the least.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Stintz did not set out to stick a finger in the mayor's eye when she raised her doubts about the Eglinton line in its current form. She saw a big problem coming down the tracks for the mayor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expensive cars ordered for the line were not really designed for extended underground travel, she says. Putting the line underground was impossible through the Don Valley and expensive on eastern Eglinton, adding up to $2-billion to the cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a political hitch, too. The mayor never took his deal with the province on Eglinton to city council. Councillors were annoyed at that, and many were planning to challenge him when the plan did come to council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when Ms. Stintz aired the idea of putting the eastern end of the line on the surface, as originally planned, she thought she was offering Mr. Ford a way out of a sticky spot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The money saved by going with a cheaper plan for Eglinton, she argued, could help pay for Mr. Ford's pet project, a Sheppard subway extension, or for other badly needed transit improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She even thought she had buy-in from the Fords. Doug Ford, she says, was positive when she broached it with him in a meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, he isn't positive now. The Fords, who put a premium on loyalty, are treating Ms. Stintz as a mutineer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She doesn't deserve that. Only weeks ago, she rallied to their side in a key vote over the city budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When middle-of-the-road councillors thwarted the mayor by amending his budget to save $15-million worth of programs threatened with the axe, she delivered a passionate speech to city council on the need to stop borrowing from the future to cover spending in the present.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the Fords have repaid Ms. Stintz by sandbagging her at the transit commission. Her compromise proposal for Eglinton is stalled. Mr. Ford has rallied a group of Scarborough councillors to support him on undergrounding the Eglinton line through the eastern suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Left-leaning councillors, meanwhile, are trying to revive Transit City, the network of light-rail lines championed by David Miller when he was mayor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metrolinx, the provincial transit agency, is pleading with the city to get its act together and arrive at a common position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will all go to city council in April. Ms. Stintz, meanwhile, is twisting in the wind, her job at the TTC hanging by a thread. Why? Because she said what was on her mind and called nonsense by its name.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Campaign spending is expected to top $6-billion (U.S.) in 2012 as the price of winning the Oval Office or a seat in Congress keeps going up. Three factors help explain the election inflation: Barack Obama's bundlers, Mitt Romney's Wall Street fans and Karl Rove.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obama's bundlers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Barack Obama raised almost $140-million for his own re-election bid in 2011, his campaign revealed in a Jan. 31 filing. He has raised a similar amount on behalf of the Democratic National Committee. While Mr. Obama is on track to become the first $1-billion presidential candidate, his campaign has dismissed suggestions he will spend that much, though he should easily surpass the nearly $750-million he spent in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Obama campaign touts its reliance on small donors – more than 500,000 of them in the fourth quarter of 2011 alone, with an average contribution of $55 – the really serious money is brought in by the President's army of über-connected bundlers. They hit up friends and business associates to the tune of $2,500 a pop – the maximum amount individuals can contribute directly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far in this election cycle, a total of 445 bundlers have raised $75-million for the President. But a much smaller group of elite bundlers are part of the $500,000 club. They include Hollywood moguls such as Dreamworks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg and producer Harvey Weinstein. Desperate Housewife Eva Longoria raised between $200,000 and $500,000 for Mr. Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One name the President probably wishes he could remove from the list is Jon Corzine, the former New Jersey governor embroiled in scandal over the bankruptcy of the derivatives firm he led. He raised more than $500,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Romney's hedge-fund money</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination has bundlers, too. He just doesn't release their names. Mr. Romney directly raised $57-million for his primary campaign in 2011. And while he may not match Mr. Obama in direct fundraising for the 2012 election, he will be able to count on outside groups spending millions on his behalf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Restore Our Future, the main Super PAC supporting Mr. Romney, raised more than $30-million in 2011. Super PACs have no restrictions on donations from individuals. They can also accept money from corporations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Romney's Super PAC got $1-million each from at least half a dozen powerful hedge-fund managers including John Paulson, Paul Singer and Julian Robertson. It also got $1-million from Mr. Romney's former <span class="companylink">Bain Capital</span> colleague Edward Conard and $1-million from heirs to the Marriott hotel fortune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republican Super PACs raised about four times more than Democratic Super PACs in 2011. Mr. Obama has frowned on them, but Priorities USA, the Super PAC supporting him, got $2-million from Mr. Katzenberg and $100,000 from Steven Spielberg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rove's millions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once dubbed Bush's Brain for the strategic skills he brought to the White House of George W. Bush, Karl Rove has spent the better part of the past two years raising money to oust the current occupant of the Oval Office. His American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS together raised $51-million in 2011 and plan to spend as much as $300-million this year, largely to defeat Mr. Obama and incumbent Senate Democrats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dallas billionaire Harold Simmons gave $7-million to American Crossroads. The Super PAC also got $100,000 from media mogul Sam Zell and $500,000 from Kenny Troutt. Mr. Troutt became a billionaire when Canada's Teleglobe bought his Texas-based long-distance company in the 1990s, a transaction Teleglobe shareholders soon regretted.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we're going to be honest, even in its heyday the lakeside complex never did quite live up to those lofty dreams. It was a great place to see a concert, at least back in the era of the quaint little Forum and its revolving stage. It offered a unique movie-going experience, until commercial chains put in Imax theatres of their own. It had bumper boats and a waterslide and a “punching bag forest,” which all held a certain magic for kids. None of this really made it the beacon to the world – Toronto's answer to Expo 67 – that its creators envisioned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there was something noble about those ambitions. And there is something depressing about how they ultimately panned out: the provincial government of the day announcing Wednesday that it's indefinitely shutting most of Ontario Place's current operations, because it's tired of losing $20-million a year.</p>

Rob Ford, the hawkish mayor of Toronto, likes to talk about keeping things we “need to have,” while letting go of ones that are just “nice to have.” Dalton McGuinty's provincial Liberals don't speak quite as bluntly, but with the odd exception – an ongoing investment in the Pan Am Games – they increasingly find themselves forced to embrace a similar philosophy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the financial circumstances, even setting aside what a drop in the bucket $20-million is, it's hard to blame them. But the tough decisions forced by today's limitations are a reminder of the opportunities squandered in times when it was possible to keep dreaming a little bigger. And Ontario Place is a prime example of that, particularly for the way it represents the stunted development of the province's biggest city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time of its construction, Ontario Place was reportedly mocked in some corners as “Toronto Place.” And indeed, it seems as much as anything else to have been about bringing life to the city's waterfront. But subsequent governments, federal as well as provincial, have been wary of incurring backlashes in places where Toronto is seen as too privileged already. When they have moved forward anyway, it's often been tentatively and a little half-heartedly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in the late 1960s, then-premier John Robarts could talk about letting “your imagination run wild,” while signing off on a development plan that involved a pair of man-made islands. More recently, he would have been laughed at.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Ontario Place was allowed to languish, going from a successful attraction to a white elephant, because government neither invested nor found creative ways to entice others to do so. The waterfront around it has (to be generous) developed in fits and starts, with endlessly discussed improvements taking forever to get off the ground. Meanwhile, the “nice-to-have”/”need-to-have” line is blurred by a public-transit system nowhere near what one would expect in the populous financial capital of an affluent country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The happy caveat is that these and other failings haven't prevented Toronto from growing in some fairly spectacular ways since Ontario Place first opened its gates. An influx of newcomers has helped make it an infinitely more vibrant place than it once was, while entrepreneurship and energy and ambition have revitalized many of its neighbourhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thankfully, that advertisement from 40-plus years ago no longer holds up. Ontario Place isn't us; it doesn't show people who we are and where we're going. That's because, like some other spaces and services left to government's charge, it hasn't kept pace with the society around it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's perhaps fitting, or at least a little poignant, that former Progressive Conservative leader John Tory has been pegged to try to figure out what to do with Ontario Place now. Few public figures have closer ties to the party of the late Mr. Robarts and Bill Davis, who was premier when Ontario Place opened in 1971.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I want it to be excellent,” Mr. Tory said Wednesday, “a people place, something that will help to create jobs and enrich the cultural and social fabric of Toronto and takes advantage of what is a jewel of a location.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It sounded a little like that old think-big optimism. But there's much lost time to make up for. And in today's world of government, letting your imagination run wild is a much less enticing prospect.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VANCOUVER -- “In Cuba, they don't have any income inequality because they are all poor. We want to have an economy that is giving the people the opportunity to advance,” B.C. Finance Minister Kevin Falcon says in a comment on the growing disparity between rich and poor in the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BC Stats has reported that British Columbia was second only to Alberta in terms of income inequality among the provinces in 2009.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response, Finance Minister Kevin Falcon championed economic opportunity over equality. “We want to have a high-wage-earning economy in B.C.,” he told the CBC. The Liberal government wants people in every income bracket to keep more of their money in their pockets, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Falcon may have been exaggerating about Cuba to make a point. Despite its poverty, Cuba has an income gap that has been growing since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990, fed by market-oriented reforms, a vibrant underground cash economy and sizeable remittances from Cubans overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was closer to reality when talking about the B.C. economy. After a decade of Liberal government policies, the province has significantly more high income earners who are paying substantially lower taxes. At the same time, the province has fewer low income earners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first glance, it looks like the Liberal policies worked. The province is better off than it was 10 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. had 411,704 families with earnings above $100,000 in 2009, (about 21 per cent) compared to 292,152 families (17 per cent) in 2001, according to the most recent figures available from Statistics Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the number of low income earners dropped, although at a much smaller rate. Statistics Canada shows 520,456 families earned under $30,000 (26.8 per cent) in 2009, compared to 533,676 families earning under $30,000 (31.1 per cent) in 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those numbers do not tell the full story. A high-wage economy has not translated into better times for all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Political economist Marjorie Griffin Cohen of Simon Fraser University says high income earners received a disproportionate share of the increase in provincial wealth over the past decade. By comparison to other provinces, lower income earners in B.C. were shortchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's true that B.C. has fewer poor people. “But that's not relevant to what is happening,” she said. “Everyone else [in Canada] is doing better than we are and there is no reason for that. We had good years, but the income gap continued to rise even in good years.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prof. Cohen, past chairwoman of Women's Studies at SFU, said women in the work force have especially felt the brunt of Liberal policies. The average wage for women across Canada in 2009 was $1,600 higher than the average wage for women in B.C., she said. In 2001, B.C. women on average were earning $1,200 less than the national average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Everyone's income has been rising . . . but income has increased for some people a whole lot more than for others,” Prof. Cohen said. The poverty rate has gone down in B.C., but is still the highest in the nation, she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Occupy movement drew attention last fall to the glaring gap in income between the rich and poor. A study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development released in December found that Canada had greater income inequality than most OECD nations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A high-wage economy is only part of the answer. As Dan Schrier writes in the BC Stats report, called Mind the <span class="companylink">Gap</span>: Income Inequality Growing, the challenge is figuring out how large a gap between the high wage earners and the lowest earners should be acceptable.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Music can be a powerful force. In fact, it is sometimes banned (along with steroids and stimulant drugs) to prevent athletes from gaining an unfair advantage during competitions. Why? Because of its capacity to energize and increase endurance.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elite types looking to win a big marathon prize may have to leave their ear buds at home. But the right tunes can be a great aid for those of us who still need a little push to get ourselves moving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The driving beats and locomotive thunder of bass-heavy dance music have undoubtedly fuelled many of my most rewarding running sessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How does music boost motivation so strongly and otherwise help get us through the most tedious of tasks?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of music's energizing effects comes from its ability to engage the body's sympathetic nervous system. The activation of this system readies the body for action whenever we face a challenge in our environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airways open, the heart rate accelerates, and muscles are primed to move. Auditory signals – abrupt sounds or those that suddenly increase in frequency or volume – trigger alerting responses and increase physiological arousal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Music is comprised of these and other patterns of sounds that have been shown to affect levels of physical excitability. A simple increase in the pace of the music we listen to, for example, can quicken our pulse and accelerate our breathing. And this can be great for physical exercise or a boring task that might lull you to sleep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Music also affects the co-ordination of activity within and across different parts of the brain. Studies examining patterns of electrical activity across the brain suggest that synchronization of brain signals is important for linking perceptual, cognitive and motor processes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent results suggest further that a repetitive beat, such as that in a musical rhythm, synchronizes brainwaves in ways that may be particularly helpful in coupling what you hear with how you move. The co-ordination and execution of repetitive muscle movements may be made more efficient by matching the movements to a musical beat. This may explain why individuals strategically running to a beat run faster and use less oxygen than those who do not pace themselves with music.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Physical and mental endurance is also enhanced by music's capacity to draw our attention away from the negative aspects of a task. The brain's attention system, which includes some of the top and outermost regions of the frontal and parietal lobes, acts to enhance neural activity in areas that contribute to whatever we are focused on and reduce activity from other areas of the brain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Focusing on a favourite song combats de-motivating brain signals associated with fatigue or boredom. In the exercise domain, this has been shown to be particularly effective in moderately intense exercise. And while music does not seem to reduce the perceived strain of highly intense exercise, upbeat music has been shown to increase positive feelings about the intensity of the exercise compared to those of individuals in the same study who listened to less intense music.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed much of music's power lies in its ability to elicit emotional reactions and enhance mood. Recent neuroimaging investigations have allowed a dramatic increase in our understanding of how different networks of emotion- and motivation-related brain regions are recruited to produce these affective experiences – from the visceral shiver running down one's spine, to the sense of empowerment that can arise from a good set of lyrics, or intensely positive memories associated with a favourite piece of music.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the next time you face a daunting task, think of a strategic musical choice to give your brain and body a motivational boost.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How mean is Stephen Harper? Mean enough to kick a helpless granny in the chops. Just ask Susan Eng at CARP, the aptly named association for retired people. CARP is always carping about something. This time, it's outraged that the government might start gutting people's Old Age Security cheques. “There is no reason why we have to cut the social safety net for the people who need it the most,” said Ms. Eng. Opposition politicians warn that, thanks to Mr. Harper, our seniors may soon be relying on soup kitchens and cat food.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These histrionics ignore the fact that any changes to OAS wouldn't come for years and wouldn't affect a single person who's currently a senior, or anything close to it. OAS is a relatively small amount of money ($540.12 a month) that gets taxed back as your income goes up. And despite what Ms. Eng says, nobody pays for it in advance. It comes from current general tax revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, seniors have a sturdier social safety net than any other segment of society. The poverty rate among the elderly in Canada is 5.9 per cent, much lower than it is for children or those of working age. The reduction in the elderly poverty rate over the past few decades has been called the major success story of Canadian social policy in the 20th century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, our biggest social problem is not how to redistribute more money to the needy old. It's how to protect everyone else from the tsunami of geezers that's about to crash on our shores and suck the wealth of future generations out to sea. The war against seniors' pension reforms is a war against the young.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest, most powerful and most dangerous lobby in the United States today isn't the banking lobby or Big Pharma. It's CARP's big brother, AARP. No politician dares tangle with the seniors' lobby. No one dares to question social security and health care for seniors, even though they threaten to keep the U.S. in hock to China forever. As economics writer Robert Samuelson has noted, there's no path to a balanced budget without restraining retiree spending. And yet it's strictly off-limits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the geezer population set to double, their entitlements will double, too – pensions, health care and all the rest. But it's worse still because, thanks to modern medicine, people live forever. When the federal government introduced OAS in 1952, the qualifying age was 70 and many people didn't live long enough to collect it. Today, it's 65, and a Canadian of that age can expect to collect OAS for nearly 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, the pool of workers to pay for all these benefits is shrinking. Not long ago, we had five workers for every retiree. Now we're heading toward a ratio of 2 to 1. The seniors' lobby argues that they paid for their entitlements in advance, but that's only partly true. The C.D. Howe Institute's William Robson figures that the gap between Canada's projected revenues and the cost of what we've promised to current and future seniors amounts to $2.8-trillion. No wonder every country in the Western world is trying to roll back retirement age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not suggesting we cast the elderly out to sea on ice floes. But we need to think about how we allocate our money. Are we really sure we want to transfer so much wealth from struggling young families to relatively well-off geezers? How smart is it to suck our grandchildren dry? How many schools won't get built because we're buying Lipitor for people who can already afford it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all seniors are well off, of course. But plenty of them are. Personally, I think it's ludicrous that my affluent pals and I will be entitled to two or three decades worth of free doctoring, free drugs, free hip implants, discount transit tickets and other goodies. (I do like the seniors' movie rate, though.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am constantly astonished at the opposition parties' stout defence of entitlements for people who demonstrably don't need them. And I think anyone with a social conscience and a CARP membership should tear it up.</p>

Since its housing bubble burst, home prices have fallen by 32 per cent and housing starts are 75 per cent lower. This has been bitter medicine, but absolutely necessary to restore the health of the patient.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tantalizingly, the past several months have hinted at a strengthening pulse in the U.S. housing market. Most metrics of activity have bottomed out, and some are even fluttering a touch higher. The rental market is beginning to stir – a classic leading indicator for housing demand. Production of construction equipment and construction supplies is cycling higher.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why do we care about any of this? Because houses are special. Not only are they the only asset you get to live in, but they constitute a dominant 72 per cent of household debt and compete with equities for status as the most valuable household asset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing tends to punch many times above its weight during the early stages of an economic recovery, reaching into such varied precincts as residential construction, local government revenue, the employment of millions of workers, the deployment of billions of dollars in building materials and furnishings, and even the boosting of consumption via a brawny wealth effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, as we scan the horizon for evidence of a proper economic rebound, housing matters a great deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is very good news, then, that affordability is now excellent, thanks mainly to ultralow interest rates and depressed home prices. The monthly carrying cost of a newly purchased dwelling demands the smallest fraction of household income in decades. By this standard, home prices are in fact about a third below fair value. More generally, Americans now dedicate the smallest share of their income to financial obligations since the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does this portend a wondrous comeback? It's possible, but probably not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one, affordability is only relevant over the long run. In the short run, affordability is a necessary but insufficient condition for a recovery, and is easily obscured by market psychology, credit availability, and the precarious balance between supply and demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is susceptible to the same manias and panics that plague other investments. When the going is good, people become intoxicated by the relentless rise in home prices and imagine it will continue forever. But when things go badly, houses are seen as little more than an illiquid asset at risk of a capital loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For America, panic has turned into despair. This is consistent with a bottoming of the market. In surveys, Americans now concede that it is a good time to buy a home, but have no intention of doing so themselves. This despair will eventually evolve into cautious optimism, but a psychological sea change of that magnitude takes time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most homes are bought on credit. Thus, a precondition for a revived housing market is access to credit. But the mortgage market remains stagnant and most indicators signal further caution ahead. Mortgage delinquency, home foreclosure and personal bankruptcy rates all remain extremely elevated: a hostile lending environment if ever there was one. Accordingly, the Fed's loan officer survey shows that mortgage lending standards remain extraordinarily tight. Banks are locked into a deleveraging cycle, and the loans they do issue go into friendlier parts of the economy. If it's any consolation, borrowers are equally shy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A further constraint on the U.S. housing market is a huge overhang of unoccupied homes. As classically defined, there are about 2.8 million too many homes in America. This excess will take three or four years to whittle down. Additionally, more than 4 per cent of U.S. mortgage holders are in foreclosure, over 10 per cent are delinquent on their payments, and as many as 29 per cent of single-family mortgages are under water, meaning the mortgage is worth more than the market value of the home. These represent millions more homes that could tip into vacancy. Despite the efforts of policy makers to deal with this scourge, it constitutes a material and lasting drag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, the U.S. housing market has probably flattened out, and this merits celebration. But the prospect of a swift leap higher is low. More likely is a gradual multiyear recovery that proves incapable of elevating the broader economy beyond sluggish growth. The housing market is still a long way from full ignition.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This 35-year-old website designer and Canadian resident has been sentenced to death, after being found guilty of desecrating and insulting Islam. His crime was to develop software to upload photographs – a web program that was then used by pornographic websites.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Malekpour has said he had no knowledge of any such use of his software. Even if he had, his actions would not justify the death penalty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian government is right to call on Iran to release Mr. Malekpour – as well as the many other people imprisoned without due process. “His case is but one example of the refusal by Iranian authorities to respect their international human-rights obligations,” said Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird this week. Thousands of people are believed to be on death row in Iran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Canada's influence in Iran is limited, lobbying for Mr. Malekpour's release could be effective in the long run. Last year, Iran released two American hikers who were accused of espionage, in part to seem magnanimous before President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's appearance at the UN General Assembly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Malekpour was arrested in 2008 during a visit to Tehran to see his terminally ill father. He was incarcerated in Evin prison, tortured and then forced into a false confession. Last year, after international outcry about his case, Iran's Supreme Court annulled his sentence. The court found a list of discrepancies in the trial that needed to be investigated. It is deeply regrettable that this decision was then reversed, and Mr. Malekpour's execution sentence reinstated in November, 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Malekpour is not a domestic Iranian activist or one of the usual innocents vulnerable to the Iranian state's wanton disregard for human life. He is an engineer who had the misfortune to develop a successful website. Executing such a person is absurd, and wholly unjustified.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the federal government all but washing its hands of any role in health care, it's fallen to the provinces to grapple with what is arguably the most vexing public policy file in Canada.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, we've been warned of the baby boomers' impact on provincial health budgets. Well, the first waves of this demographic are here. No wonder Ottawa's sought higher ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In trying to contain costs, the premiers recently established a working group on health-care innovation. It will be the task force's job to investigate inventive ways to begin bending health expenditures downward. As a start, it could do worse than obtaining a copy of a recent report by Western University's International Centre for Health Innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study, Strengthening Health Systems Through Innovation, examines the lessons Canada could learn from seven comparator countries – the U.S., Britain, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, France and Switzerland. It notes that while developed countries are being challenged by increasing demands for health services, Canada has made significantly less progress in meeting those pressures than others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anne Snowdon, co-author of the report, says the research shows that the most successful examples of innovation begin at a local level, then grow from there. “You don't have to boil the ocean,” she said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the most impressive cost gains the authors came across were made around managing chronic illnesses, which only increase with an aging population. In its almost singular focus on acute care and issues such as wait times, Canada has missed the boat, the report suggests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you look at any data on hospital beds, 70 per cent of them [in Canada] are occupied by people with chronic illness challenges,” said Prof. Snowdon. “We are structured around acute care delivery and yet the majority of people who need health care need chronic illness management to keep them out of hospitals. If you manage a chronic illness properly, you shouldn't need an emergency room.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's pretty simple: If you reduce the amount of time people spend in hospitals, you drive down health-care costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what are other countries doing? Many, like the Netherlands and France, have created 24/7 physician coverage. Health care is often provided in people's homes or at a nearby clinic, not at the nearest hospital. “So they have really reversed the care model and turned it on its head,” says Prof. Snowdon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After-hours care in the Netherlands, the report says, is organized in primary-care physician co-operatives in which 40 to 250 doctors take care of patient populations ranging from 100,000 to 500,000. The doctors are paid by the hour while on call. The co-ops are usually in or near a hospital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“During after-hours periods, the GPs will carry out telephone consultations … see patients and perform home visits” via chauffeured cars equipped with infusion drips and defibrillators. For home visits, most patients are visited within an hour of calling, and 70 per cent of those experiencing potentially life-threatening problems are reached within 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You'd think such a system would be prohibitively expensive. Yet, when it comes to chronic illness management, Canada spends far more than either the Netherlands or France.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around-the-clock physician care may be something the premiers' task force should look into. “If consumers end up winning, there is no reason it has to be controversial or a hard sell,” says Prof. Snowdon. Then again, this is Canada.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My husband is not a physically affectionate person. Once we'd moved into the marriage phase of our relationship, he gave up on kissing, holding hands – the random acts of physical contact that happen in a relationship. I don't like it, but I could cope with it if he weren't so mean when I do touch him. I give him a kiss and he says “What?” – as if a kiss has to mean that I want something. I should have seen the signs when we were dating. I try to be patient, but I keep blowing up. Recently, I accused him of being just like his dad, a person who pushes away anyone who tries to show him affection. Needless to say, the silent treatment ensued, with less physical affection than ever. What's your take? Input from Pam would be welcome too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pam (my wife) is away this week on business – so, sorry to disappoint on that score.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But since I know her well (we've been together nearly 20 years), maybe I can attempt to speak for her:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I certainly understand your dilemma, and I think it's one many married couples face – though in our relationship, Dave's the affectionate one. It's not that I don't love him: I love Dave very much. Not only is he brilliant, I also find him extremely attractive and a good dresser. His writing dazzles my cerebellum, and when I see him with our children I get all … but I digress. What I'm trying to say is, it's just the way I am.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks, fake Pam! It's true: I'm always attempting to drape myself all over her, give her little kisses and so forth, whereas given her druthers she'd be mostly content to go about her domestic business without all this pesky interaction with her mwah-mwah, hugsy-wugsy hubby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She's like a dude that way, and at first that kind of hurt my feelings. We'd quarrel about it and I would sulk and get all huffy – which, as in your case, only made things worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But one day I thought: “Ah, the heck with it, it's just the way she is, I'm going to stuff my little ‘hurt' feelings in a sack – I am a man, after all – and keep giving her hugs and kisses whenever I encounter her in the corridors of our domicile.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it worked a treat! Now I practically chase her around the house, snapping wet towels at her, while she screams and giggles and tries to dodge me. Secretly, I think, she loves it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a man, though – well, I'd say ease into it. You're kind of fighting 10,000 years of evolution. Let us digress for a brief moment to take a brief look at The History of Men:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homo Metrosexualis, a.k.a. “Sensitive Guy,” is a relatively recent wrinkle in human evolution. For thousands of years, we men were hunter-gatherers and/or soldiers. We didn't talk a lot because if we did we might startle the quarry, alert the enemy to our whereabouts. We saw no reason to hug anyone except if they had fallen in the field and needed to be carried back to base. We shrugged off flesh wounds, let alone our feelings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this is imprinted deep within our DNA. End of lesson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Me, I'm glad men have opened up and are no longer imprisoned in our armour of stoicism and silence. But we're all evolving at different rates. You say “you should have seen the signs” when you were dating. You could put it another way: You knew what you were getting into. Maybe it's just the kind of guy he is. You say he's like his dad. Well, duh! How our parents nurtured us, or not, is also imprinted deep in our DNA, and just as hard to shake as 10,000 years of evolution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your husband's Dad probably figured he showed his affection by being a stern father, a good provider and a faithful husband. (Many men of previous generations seemed to feel this way.) Your husband may think the same: that he expresses his affection adequately through, basically, being a good man.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe probe him a little on that score – there may be more emotional lava under his hard, cool crust than you suspect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, keep the hugs coming. I know it isn't the advice most advice columnists would give (“blah blah seek counselling blah blah”) and, of course, there might be something more sinister afoot that could lead you to thumb through the Yellow Pages looking under “Lawyers – Divorce.” (In which case, a sensible first step might be counselling.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But try my method first. Sounds to me like you love the lug, even if he's a little flinchy. Physical affection – touching, kissing – is a powerful frosty-exterior melting agent. Bestow affection without thought of getting it in return and see what happens. Even if he pulls back or cracks wise, just keep up your amorous assault, soldier!</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The violence in Egypt on Wednesday, where more than 70 people were killed in battles between rival soccer fans after a game, is so extreme it seems not to bear on love of sport at all. Many fans had arrived at the game with weapons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soccer violence has plagued European teams, too. The beautiful game, perhaps for no other reason than that it is the world's most popular sport, has experienced the worst violence, though on relatively rare occasions. An organized group of rowdies known as the “ultras” reportedly contributed to the massacre. A country in a state of upheaval, moving fitfully toward a more open society, may be vulnerable to violent anarchy partly because of the loss of recognized authority. Or maybe it was just a soccer riot.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North America has not had the same fan-instigated violence but is not immune to a loss of proportion. The Vancouver riot after last season's Stanley Cup final was just one example of post-championship hooliganism; there have been sports-related riots in Montreal and Edmonton, too. These are not pitched battles between rivals but involve out-of-control drunkenness and, in one famous Montreal case, a political element. In Vancouver, it bordered on the miraculous that no one died.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is it about sports that looses the Furies? Perhaps sports are just an excuse for mob behaviour. The riots in Britain last summer did not follow sports. They followed a police shooting, but it quickly became clear they had nothing to do with that killing. The deeper problem may be why so many people in one place are apparently so eager to be part of a mob.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loss of proportion over sports also shows up in small ways. In Canada, it's manifested in an acceptance of vicious abuse of referees, the neutral arbiter. A new survey of 632 minor hockey referees, mostly in Ontario, by Alun Ackery, of the University of Toronto's Division of Emergency Medicine, found widespread physical attacks on referees – they were doused with coffee, waited for in parking lots, grabbed by the throat (by a player), punched in the face (by a parent), they had an arm shattered by a slap shot at close range, they were cross-checked in the head, and so on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Egypt's soccer massacre may not have anything to tell us about Vancouver, Montreal or the corner hockey rink. But it does have something to say about how the essence of sports, not winning but sportsmanship and the pursuit of an ideal, can be overtaken by the worst instincts, anywhere.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time there was no drama, no braying from fans or grand statement of intentions from management or shrill media criticism that Nazem Kadri was treated unfairly.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor should there be. One night after a third-period collapse against the Pittsburgh Penguins, the Toronto Maple Leafs took to the ice against the same team with Colby Armstrong back in the lineup and Kadri contemplating future bus rides to Peoria, to borrow the line from that Toronto Marlies commercial that must cause Brian Burke and Dallas Eakins to cringe every time they see it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good thing, too, because the back end of the home-and-home series at the Air Canada Centre on Wednesday night was no place for Kadri. Not yet. It was a man's game with precious little room and a great deal of rope-'em – a hard-earned 1-0 win for the Maple Leafs delivered by Clarke MacArthur's 16th goal at 13:55 of the third period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is easy to say that the fact Kadri doesn't have to clear waivers meant sending him out for Armstrong, back after a concussion, was a slam-dunk. But Kadri made it easier than it should have been, doing precious little with the average 14 minutes 5 seconds of ice time he was getting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They weren't garbage minutes, either; MacArthur and Tim Connolly were alongside him, and in one game he had Joffrey Lupul on the same line, as head coach Ron Wilson shuffled lines to get Lupul and Phil Kessel going. Kadri arrived as the American Hockey League player of the month, made the good initial impression he usually does – then just disappeared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the way the Leafs have yo-yoed the former seventh pick overall, there's no guarantee he won't be back in the NHL some time soon. But if it happens, it will be because someone else has screwed up or been hurt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or because he was traded as part of a package to land another NHL-ready, first-line forward, although for all Kadri's offensive skills, this is, what, two years now that he has shown he is not up to the physical rigours of the NHL, notwithstanding Tuesday night's rare molar-rattler on the Penguins' Paul Martin?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Felipe Alou managed the Montreal Expos, he'd talk about how his team would be “whole,” whenever injured players returned. That was the distinct sense of the Leafs Wednesday, as Kadri was joined on the Marlies by Keith Aulie to make way for defenceman John-Michael Liles, who was welcomed back after a concussion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One night after a track meet that turned into a 5-4 Penguins shootout win and led Penguins coach Dan Bylsma to comment “that's probably the most scoring chances – by 10 – that we've given up all year,” the clubs slogged their way through two periods, combining for 33 shots in 40 minutes of mostly disorganized fits and starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A work of art it wasn't, chock full of fatigue and suffocating checking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Leafs' intentions were signalled early when defenceman Luke Schenn, who was particularly robust, worked over Evgeni Malkin along the boards using his arms, gloves, elbows and stick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was James Reimer's first start in goal since Jan. 17 and he had his moments in the first period, when the Penguins went out of their way to fire pucks high to his glove side, but he was steady in the third period especially, when the Penguins fired six shots through heavy traffic. MacArthur's goal developed after James Neal's tip beat Reimer over the shoulder but hit the crossbar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MacArthur sneaked off the Leafs' bench on a line change and trailed in as the play headed up ice, finishing off a three-way play with Mikhail Grabovski and Nikolai Kulemin by tucking the puck past Brent Johnson, who was giving Marc-André Fleury a night off after 23 consecutive starts. A nifty goal on a night for the stout-hearted. No place for boys, this one.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest topic in literature these days – aside from the endless e-book debate – is, once again, the difference between fiction and non-fiction.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We dissected this issue in 2006, after James Frey's bestselling memoir of addiction turned out to be untrue. At the time, many people – particularly artists – argued that there was no reason to dismiss a powerful narrative simply because it was labelled non-fiction. They thought we would have enjoyed it just as much if we had known we were reading a novel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Frey incident actually caused a backlash, I think, against journalistic accuracy among creative writers. It is so cool to say now that story is all and truth is irrelevant. I have heard of a university teacher of “non-fiction” encouraging students to make stuff up in their memoirs. (The fact that memoir-writing is now a common graduate-level university course is also evidence of the rise of this issue.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the focus of the discussion has turned the other way, not to things that claim to be true, but to things that claim to be art. A manifesto about the irrelevance of conventional fiction made something of a stir when it was published in 2010: Reality Hunger, by American author David Shields, argued for a contemporary style of narrative that would involve mixing sources, original and not, real and imaginary. Pure fiction, Shields argues, is boring, because it is not “real” enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">French author Michel Houellebecq no doubt pleased Shields when he was caught inserting a passage from Wikipedia verbatim into a novel. Houellebecq gave a respectably Shieldian answer to the charges: Stealing and rearranging passages was perfectly okay if it was for “artistic purposes.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there are increasingly frequent controversies about romans à clef, in the age of confessional, blog-style fiction: Tell-all memoirs about other people's love lives, dressed up as “novels” – are these to be given the respect that genuinely inventive art does, or are they just venal vehicles for libel? A book review in The Globe and Mail last week addressed a recent one of these. A U.S. novel called You Deserve Nothing by Alexander Maksik caused a scandal when it came out because the author described a real affair he had with one of his students and called it fiction. There were sections written in the student's voice, which struck some of her friends as unkind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is, to me, a complete philosophical non-issue – of course, fiction has always worked (and offended people) in this way, has always been inspired by reality, stolen voices, twisted them. Nothing unusual here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Globe's reviewer, Stacey Madden, a novelist himself, pointed out, quite truthfully, that “for many fiction writers, life and art are indistinguishable.” But then he went on to dismiss any distinction between fiction and non-fiction. “It matters little how a work is categorized,” he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This fashionable view is convincing, paradoxically, only as long as we restrict our conversation to works that label themselves fiction. Yes, of course, any kind of interaction with other genres is welcome in the domain of creative art. I want David Shields to write any kind of collage-pastiche-encyclopedia-entry novel he wants – who could have a moral objection to artistic experimentation? It is significant that Shields, Houellebecq and Maksik all call themselves fiction writers despite their proud pillaging of the real.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the everyday world of pseudo-journalistic non-fiction publishing, where memoirists vie for media attention with ever-more-alarming personal stories, the view that there is no such thing as truth is dangerous. What was offensive about Frey's claim of truth was that it was not an artistic ploy but a marketing one. He knew that the average person would not, in fact, react to his story with awe and compassion if they thought it was a novel. In fact, they wouldn't even read it, because the average person doesn't read novels. The people of America wanted a person, not a story, a real person whom they could see interviewed on Oprah. His lie was exploitative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is much more brave to exploit the lives of others and admit that one's representations are distorting, imaginary, true and not true – to bravely lie and admit to lying; that is fiction, like all art, a pure and noble lie. To invent personal suffering to garner celebrity for oneself as a person is not so noble, and not, I think, what contemporary intellectuals want to praise when they promote their genre-bending new values.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This thing called Undercover Boss arrived on CBS in February, 2010, airing in the plum spot just after the Super Bowl.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years later, along comes Undercover Boss Canada (W, 9 p.m.). Like the U.S. version, it's as bogus as all get out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a start, there is something utterly cheesy about the premise. It plays into the ludicrous idea – one that stretches back to when the world was all serfs and nobility – that if only the benign King/Queen/whatever at the top knew the struggles of those at the bottom, then they'd make things right. Nice fantasy, but only a fantasy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, workers organized into guilds, associations and trade unions to improve their situation, instead of relying on wishful fantasies about the rich and powerful. See, along the way, it turned out that those at the top were more likely to say “Let them eat cake” than step in to provide more bread.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's especially grating about the Canadian version is that the premise of a CEO doing mundane, low-paid work undercover is presented as a way forward in difficult economic times. As if this ruse was all done in a noble spirit of transparency and accountability. As tonight's debut opens, a voiceover booms, “With the world economy in a fragile state, companies must adapt….” And then we see the CEO of the Toronto Zoo get ready to clean up a pile of penguin poop, among other things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The format stinks as much as penguin poop, to be honest. We start with the CEO profile. Immigrant story. Family man. Nice person. Blah blah. As the entirely predictable story then unfolds, a voiceover makes such ridiculous pronouncements as, “When the shocking truth sinks in, lives will never be the same.” And after every commercial break there's the tiresome, repetitive summary of what has already happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end, there are hugs. Yep, loads of hugs. And some employees, usually the ones with an elderly or sick relative, get a gift of a short holiday or a night out. And all is right with the world. As if.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tonight's opening show is particularly perplexing. I'm sure that John Tracogna, CEO of the Toronto Zoo, is a nice man. But when he performs various tasks at the zoo, in a disguise, he seems oddly ignorant of what actually happens at the zoo. (He should have screened the excellent but cancelled series, Zoo Diaries, about his own workplace.) The feeding and care of animals is a daily, repetitive and complex task, but he seems taken aback by what unfolds. He uses such management-speak terms as “we can transfer this best practice,” but is surprised by the labour involved in cleaning toilets and interacting with zoo customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a contrived crisis when Tracogna's disguise begins to disintegrate in the humidity. There's another when he is challenged by measuring food for the animals by the gram. There's a bit of precious irony when he's told to keep “humble and quiet” around the gorillas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the conclusion, when all is revealed, there are hugs and tears. Nobody gets a raise. Nobody talks about the fact that under Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's regime, the Toronto Zoo is a political football being kicked around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flimsiness of the artifice at work in this reality series is all too apparent. In the two episodes available for review, the employees encountered are all saints. Nobody is truly disgruntled, angry or even slacking. You couldn't meet sweeter people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later episodes delve into the inner workings of Second Cup, Pizza Pizza, 1-800-Got-Junk? and <span class="companylink">FedEx Canada</span>. What might be of interest in Toronto, though, is episode four, which features Karen Stintz, politician and chair of the Toronto Transit Commission, going undercover to see what it's like working for the TTC. This is a truly bizarre bit of theatre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stintz's family story is emphasized first, of course. She tears up and declares, “I love my family!” That's nice. But what's unnerving is the blunt acknowledgment by Stintz that she's going undercover to figure out what kind of cuts can or cannot be made in Toronto's transit system. Then she drives to work at the TTC. Yes, drives. Doesn't take TTC, but drives!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stintz gets a pretty superficial view of working life on the front line of the TTC. It's unclear what she thinks can be cut. But she does hand out a sponsored holiday, a makeover or tickets to a show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the Toronto Zoo episode, this one outrageously declines to put the situation in any authentic political context. It barely recognizes that Stintz is a politician and never puts the TTC's circumstance inside the political arena, which it surely is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Call me skeptical, but not everything can be solved with a hug, a gift certificate for a makeover or tickets to a show. The very idea that difficult workplace problems can be solved in this manner is an insult to the viewer's intelligence. All reality shows are, to some extent, bogus, but Undercover Boss Canada is utterly phony in style and method.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are living through a period of serious changes in the world economy. Never before has technology advanced so quickly. What we see today would have seemed like science fiction just 15 years ago.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In such circumstances, it is important to ensure stable development, to give our citizens maximum protection from the impact of global crises while renewing all aspects of our economy. For Russia, it would be inadmissible not to have an economy that can guarantee stability, sovereignty and a decent standard of living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We need an economy with competitive industries and infrastructure, a developed service sector and an effective agricultural system – in short, an economy that harnesses modern technology. Fostering competition is key to securing demand for innovation. Only competition can encourage private business to seek enhanced technologies and innovate their products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To restore our technological leadership, we must choose our priorities carefully. We should look at sectors such as pharmaceuticals, high-tech chemicals, composites and non-metal materials, the aviation industry, information and communication technologies and nanotechnologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experiences of countries such as South Korea and China that have successfully modernized their economies show that a push from the state is necessary. We are also counting on the active participation of Russian capital in the privatization and further development of high-tech assets. At the same time, it is necessary to find buyers in global investment circles who are ready not only to invest in an individual scientific production facility, but to bring in their connections and experience on the international markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is important is to get market leaders in global technology to move from the initial stage where Russia is perceived as a promising market to the second stage, where they start investing in local production facilities, and the third stage, where new processes and products would be designed in Russia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To encourage this, we need to expand our domestic market, making it more attractive for direct investment. In recent years, we have moved from declarations of intent to real integration by creating the Customs Union with Belarus and Kazakhstan, the single economic space and the free-trade zone with CIS countries. Russia has been consistently working toward establishing a single market with its neighbours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We must improve Russia's business climate and its attractiveness for long-term investment. Both remain dissatisfactory. In the past few years, on the initiative of President Dmitry Medvedev, we launched a series of reforms aimed at improving the business climate. Until now, however, no significant change has occurred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking plainly, we still have system-wide corruption. The cost of doing business varies depending on your “proximity” to specific individuals within the government machinery. In these conditions, entrepreneurs quite rationally tend to find backers and strike deals with them rather than observing the law. Then, having made their deals, such businesses try to suppress competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearing the way for businesses prepared to win a competitive battle on a level playing field is our fundamental system-wide goal. And this cannot be attained through economic policy alone. We must transform the state itself, its executive and judiciary branches. We must dismantle the accusation-driven collection of law-enforcement, investigative and judiciary agencies and eliminate from our legislation all vestiges of the Soviet legal system. Economic cases must be transferred from trial courts of general jurisdiction to arbitration courts. Together with the expert community, judges and entrepreneurs, we should publicly discuss and introduce before the end of this year all the necessary initiatives to achieve this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic policy must be adjusted to reduce the level of government regulation, replacing regulations with market-based mechanisms, and administrative control with liability insurance. The global crisis lent more credibility to the proponents of state-led management of the economy. But we understand that, as opposed to many other countries, the share of the state in the Russian economy and the degree of government regulation is high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have plans to privatize a number of key assets. I should emphasize that such privatization is structural, rather than fiscal, in nature. In other words, we are selling not only to obtain additional budget revenue but, above all, to boost the competitiveness of our economy and clear the way for private initiatives. We will not ignore the market environment and sell cheap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We should also reduce the participation of state-owned companies and banks, as well as that of natural monopolies, including <span class="companylink">Gazprom</span>, in the capital of other economic players, and spin off their non-core businesses, including media holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maintaining and improving macroeconomic stability is a prerequisite for all these developments. It is probably one of our greatest achievements in recent years. We have come to value macroeconomic stability and use tools for maintaining it even amid extremely adverse conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And we must eschew protectionist measures. We will soon join the World Trade Organization. Excessive protectionism always leads to stagnation, poor quality and high prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have the key drivers for success in place. Russia has a rapidly growing middle class prepared to invest in better medical services, better housing and higher retirement benefits. The task of the government is to make sure their money doesn't go up in flames.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The modernized economy should grant everybody the possibility of self-fulfilment – entrepreneurs, public officials, engineers, skilled workers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you wave around a loaded weapon, eventually you're going to shoot yourself in the foot.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sun News, the attack-dog cable channel that launched last April, has built a nascent brand out of claiming Canada for itself. Almost a year before it hit the airwaves with an orchestral rendition of O Canada, it put out a promo spot featuring scenes of pond hockey, snowshoeing and Banff National Park with a voiceover that declared: “This is Canada. … We're the True North strong and free, and the greatest place on Earth.” The ad concluded by promising viewers Sun News would be “a channel as strong and proud as the country we love.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turns out that owning Canada is a lot more complicated than wrapping yourself in the flag and mouthing a few stock phrases that even the ad agency for <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> wouldn't go near.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, Sun News 'fessed up that a citizenship affirmation ceremony it staged in its downtown Toronto studio last October was fraudulent. While viewers were told the 10 people who pronounced the oath were new Canadians, six were actually federal bureaucrats faking it for the cameras. Despite weeks of effort, producers had been unable to scare up 10 real Canadians for the ceremony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it had the option of attending an actual citizenship ceremony – four were taking place in Toronto alone – that would probably have made for boring television. Far better to have a quick hit and get on to the next item. So the Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration had helped them out, with a nudge and a wink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the story broke, other journalists lit up their Twitter accounts with glee, while many of those at the Sun Media parent chain stayed uncharacteristically silent. On Thursday morning, one of the channel's newsmen who had anchored the faux ceremony accepted an apology from a spokeswoman for the ministry. “It would seem that both of us have a little egg on our face,” Pat Bolland acknowledged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incident may just be a rookie error, the result of a new channel scrambling to do interesting programming on a shoestring budget. But it unintentionally points to a broader shift on the Canadian television and political landscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians are notorious for quiet patriotism. We turn up our noses at the flag-waving impulses of our cousins to the south. But as the cultural flood from the rest of the world swamps our homes through the Internet, Canadian broadcasters have launched a patriotic arms race as a way of standing out against the foreign onslaught. And with Stephen Harper's government reaffirming ties to traditional icons such as the Royal Family, it doesn't hurt those broadcasters – who increasingly depend for their survival on strong government protection – to play the Canada card.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of this weekend, viewers tuning in to CTV and TSN may already be tired of seeing Canadian flags, as the networks kick off a six-month orgy of promotion to get viewers excited about the Olympics. “Canadians are walking a little taller, a little prouder,” the actress Ellen Page declares in a voiceover as we glimpse waving flags and red-and-white-clad rowers. The spot concludes by promising a very Lester B. Pearson sort of Games: “Be there as the nations of the world gather to raise their flags in victory, while celebrating in peace.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CBC, too, plays up its Canadian identity. It has a prime-time English TV schedule that is almost exclusively domestic, and deep connections across the country. It provided live coverage of a real Ottawa citizenship ceremony right around the time Sun News was showing its made-for-TV production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday afternoon, Sun News announced that the producer who had set up the fake ceremony had in fact left the channel last November. She now works for the CBC.</p>

Mr. Martinez has end-stage kidney disease and desperately needs a transplant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brady, who is playing in this weekend's Super Bowl, posted a picture of himself with his coach on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> with a link to a non-profit website that matches people in need of transplants with altruistic living donors.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Mr. Brady's posting, as many as 60 people have gone on matchingdonors.com, offering to donate a kidney to Mr. Martinez, though so far none have the compatible blood and tissue types.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brady's friendship for his old coach, and efforts to heighten awareness of organ donation, are well-intentioned. But he should use his fame to help all those on transplant waitlists, and not just Mr. Martinez. Online matching websites where organ donors “choose” recipients leave both donors and recipients open to exploitation. The website in question functions the way a dating site does, allowing donors and patients to approach one another, based on the information posted. Patients are charged a one-time fee of $595 to register; donors are free and it is forbidden to pay them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Such sites have the potential to turn into ‘beauty contests' where patients in need are evaluated on the basis of their personal appearance and biography, variables which should have no relevance in organ allocation,” says a recent article in the American Journal of Transplantation. Those with the “best story” or best access shouldn't “win” a kidney, just as donors shouldn't be motivated by the possibility of access to a celebrity, or even free Super Bowl tickets. As the Vancouver nephrologist Dr. John Gill puts it: “People should not meet over an organ.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Mr. Martinez could consider enrolling in a living donor paired exchange program. Such programs, which are anonymous, allow patients with donors who are incompatible to give to someone else who has registered. Their intended recipient is matched with another donor in the registry. In two years, Canada's exchange has completed more than 100 living-donor kidney transplants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This model helps protect against the commodification of human body parts – and ensures that the allocation of organs doesn't turn into a popularity contest.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For two years, the B.C. government has made sympathetic noises about the rate of taxation that municipalities levy on industry. The expressions of concern have flowed in response to a challenge, led mostly by the forest sector, to the notion that local government can milk heavy industry in order to keep tax rates low for residential ratepayers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province has launched reviews, appointed steering committees and advisory committees that in turn named advisers to develop recommendations, and last month established a panel of tax experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anything but make a decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the Supreme Court of Canada has dumped the conflict back on the front steps of the B.C. legislature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, former premier Gordon Campbell promised to intervene in the tax dispute. He then handed the file off to Bill Bennett. Who in turn tossed it to Ben Stewart. Premier Christy Clark came along and promised action. Ida Chong inherited it next, promising last August that she would “extensively review” the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Chong's Major Industrial Property Taxation Review is dead in the water. It wasn't formally disbanded, it simply has faded away. A new panel of tax experts is on it, under the direction of cabinet's man of action, Finance Minister Kevin Falcon, who is vowing to put an end to the dithering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The court challenge was brought by the company that has led this tax revolt, <span class="companylink">Catalyst Paper Corp</span>., against the District of North Cowichan on Vancouver Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Vancouver Island community charges the company's Crofton mill a property tax rate 20 times higher than the residential rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a Jan. 20 decision, the Supreme Court described those tax levels on the mill as “harsh,” but concluded that municipalities have “a broad and virtually unfettered legislative discretion to establish property tax rates in respect of each of the property classes in the municipality, unless limited by regulation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The court ruled against the company, but the decision brought clarity, Catalyst vice-president Lyn Brown said. “If there was any doubt about where the problem needs to be solved, that is gone.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province gave local government the tax authority, and only the province can rein it in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, Catalyst's troubles deepened as it filed for creditor protection after workers at the Crofton mill rejected a restructuring plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It leaves Ms. Brown nostalgic about the days when her company was still listed as penny stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The province needs to provide an answer to those that would anchor big capital investments to the ground in this province,” she said. “Is there some hope governments and policy makers will be attentive to the conditions that industry is dealing with?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a decade of talking about it, North Cowichan Mayor Jon Lefebure says the district council is now preparing to address its over-reliance on Catalyst to pay the bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don't believe the province needs to do something from on high,” he said in an interview this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He acknowledged the mill is in “a very precarious position,” and council is planning to ask homeowners to pick up a greater share of the cost of their municipal services this year. It is a tough political pitch, but he stressed this would be one-time relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Falcon's expert panel on business taxes will consider a broader, longer-term solution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's the appropriate time, given the economic uncertainty, to ensure we are sending the right signal to investors,” Mr. Falcon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We will make sure we do everything we can to ensure B.C. is a welcoming place for investment.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just not yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His tax panel reports at the end of the summer. And if its proposed solution requires cash from the province, then industry will have to wait until next year's budget for an answer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's been a frustration,” Ms. Brown said, “that the speed the future is reaching us is a lot faster than the speed at which we are adapting.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TAX SOLUTION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2003, the B.C. government faced a tax revolt from industry, this one from port operators who complained that their host municipalities were taxing them out of competitiveness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The solution</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A property tax relief initiative. The province capped property tax rates for tenants of 15 port terminals across the lower mainland. It compensated the local governments for lost revenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Did it work?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apparently. The province has seen rapid expansion in its ports and, in 2007, extended the cap for another 10 years. It also increased the compensation to local governments and widened the scope to include ports up the coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could it work again?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This model gives both local authorities and business what they want, but the province needs to make a long-term financial commitment. That won't happen in the budget that Finance Minister Kevin Falcon will introduce on Feb. 20, which is more or less locked down now. So relief of this kind might have to wait until 2013.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First things first.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter what the NHL decides happened in the final seconds of Wednesday night's game between the Los Angeles Kings and Columbus Blue Jackets – genuine mischief, human error, or a technical recalibration of the arena clock, a theory advanced by Kings general manager Dean Lombardi – the result will stand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Los Angeles was a 3-2 regulation winner and earned two points in the standings, denying the Blue Jackets any. For the Blue Jackets, it won't matter in the grand scheme of things anyway. They'll finish 30th in the overall standings, too far down for a single point or two to matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Los Angeles, though, it's a different story. Officially the Kings earned the controversial victory on Drew Doughty's power-play goal with four-tenths of a second showing on the scoreboard clock. However, replays also showed that the clock paused fractionally as time was running out, hesitating briefly just as it hit 1.8 seconds remaining. The difference – about a second and a half, according to Blue Jackets coach Todd Richards – was the difference between a legal goal and one scored after time ran out. It also gave the Kings the two points, without having to take their chances in overtime or the shootout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Blue Jackets figured there was something amiss right away. “Something happened and it's really disappointing,” Richards said postgame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Howson, the Blue Jackets GM, wasn't prepared to let it go as simply one more bad break in a year of them for his team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Howson brought the matter to the NHL's attention and then turned it into a public issue by posting his thoughts and concerns in a lengthy blog on the team's website. The league saw enough merits in Howson's arguments to investigate the matter and determine if there was any funny business, or simply a technical glitch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Howson correctly noted: “This extra point in the standings could have an enormous impact both competitively and economically. What if the Kings make the playoffs by one point or gain home-ice advantage by one point?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We could be talking about a team not making the playoffs and missing out on millions of dollars in playoff gates.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time-keeping is one of those subjects that rarely gets discussed until there's a controversy, but for all the advanced electronics involved in these massive score clocks, one thing still hasn't changed. You need somebody's finger on the button, to start and stop the clock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anybody watching the final few seconds of any close game will be familiar with what generally happens. The defensive team ices the puck. An opposing player races back to touch up, and a few precious tenths of a second disappear as the whistle blows. The referee then skates to the time-keeper's bench and invariably puts a few extra ticks back on the clock. It happens every day, like clockwork, one might say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if it happens all the time in the dying seconds, you'd have to think that more than a few tenths disappear every time there's an icing call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Blue Jackets had let the matter slide, chances are the controversy would have died a quick death. It was a late game, on the West Coast, the victims a playoff also-ran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would have been easy, even tempting, to sweep the thing under the rug. But they didn't, so it's opened a can of worms for the NHL. Even in a worst-case scenario, if an anonymous off-ice official loses his job over the matter, it won't change the final result, which is that the Kings are credited with a point that they may or may not have earned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if the Western Conference playoff race goes down to the wire the way it did a year ago, and somebody misses out by a point, the events of Feb. 1 in Los Angeles will be difficult for a close-but-no-cigar also-ran to swallow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or to easily forget.</p>

With no money of her own and no outside support network, Rona was shunned and emotionally brutalized by her husband Mohammad Shafia and Tooba, and descended to competing with Tooba as to who would receive the most jewellery from their shared husband.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rona might have been travelling, as police reports stated, with $23,000 worth of jewellery on that last fatal road trip, but she had already acknowledged the nightmare of her situation in her diary, writing, “Tooba used to say, your life is in my hands.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not in Shafia's hands, but in Tooba's. It makes sense. Tooba was the ultimate Mean Girl in a rigid domestic hierarchy, partly because she too had no outside power, and was subjected instead to the daily rages of her honour-obsessed husband and policed by her eldest son Hamed, who was also convicted in the murders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't make her any less culpable, but it's worth exploring why she took that route.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tooba, as Asra Q. Nomani writes in The Daily Beast, is part of a pattern of women in her world who target other women: “Across the world, in traditional Muslim culture and other traditional communities, older women routinely harass, punish, and sometimes even beat Muslim girls into submission. They are the aunts, mothers, and older women in the community who insist – right along with the men – that girls behave modestly. Girls often call these older women in their community their ‘aunties.' Now they're earning a new name: ‘vigil-aunties.'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Nomani makes the obvious but essential point that by monitoring other women in their culture for morality infractions, and then emotionally terrorizing and reporting them, these vigil-aunties are repeating a pattern of abuse they themselves grew up with, “suffocating under the same rigidity and dogmatism they are now trying to enforce upon the next generation. “</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course there are many women in the Muslim culture who act as kind guides and supporters for their daughters, helping them to achieve in some poignant cases the independence and freedom the older women missed out on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sound familiar? In Western culture, wives and mothers who fought for equal rights and participation in all public spheres also acted as guides for a younger generation of women so they would never know the demoralizing feeling of having certain doors closed to them because they were female.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of this trial, there have been calls for social service agencies, police and schools to be more alert to the lethal nuances of an honour-driven ethic. But how can today's feminists help change a brutal and sometimes deadly female dynamic within such a culture? They can drive home the point that in all religions and cultures, women's rights are human rights, and equality must be a given.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But equality doesn't have to be gained by tearing a young woman away from her culture or religion or family, by advocating for only one cultural norm. Being modern doesn't automatically mean they'll all dress like JLo or hook up with guys. Older women can feel threatened by this type of freedom. But Western girls, after all, make a wide range of choices in how they partake of their culture, some eschewing early sex, some deciding there are fun ways to dress that don't so forthrightly display their attributes. The difference is, it is up to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Feminists everywhere, male and female, need to act as compassionate but unrelenting ambassadors for freedom. Religions and cultures have to be refashioned – and then monitored – to ensure women gain and then maintain an equal voice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you are a woman with real power, you are neither a vigil-auntie nor a victim. You are not Tooba Yahya, killing your rebellious daughters and a pesky rival because they offend an inhumane sense of family honour that literally could not survive in a world where women are equal to men.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You are not Rona Amir Mohammad, with nice jewellery and no future. You are you, educated, free, you have your own income and your own choices. You have a world of possibility and real power available to you. Isn't that what every girl – in every culture – deserves?</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You're too fat for that dress and you're wearing too much eyeliner. You look like a slut.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not just that they can be mean, not just the typical squabbling where they get along fine the next day. Some teen siblings seem to truly hate each other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The girls' mother:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They say really cruel things to each other. And you should hear their tone. There is no nice time. They won't be in the same room together.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why does this happen? Real hatred between siblings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reasons can be many. Jealousy: One does better in school, socially, in getting parent attention. Or one of them may be depressed, moody, constantly putting stress on herself – all of her unhappiness taken out on the one human with whom she feels totally safe. Or the most common reason of all: They think their parents always take the other's side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What do you do if you have two teenage siblings who genuinely seem to hate each other? First, you can take comfort in the fact that it probably won't last. In my experience, the child issues usually don't translate into adult bitterness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the meantime, there are a number of things you can do. The parental instinct is to try to negotiate a resolution. All too often, however, they just up their bickering, each trying to get you on her side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What you need to do is listen to them. Individually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Mom, she puts on this act, and you always believe her.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I know your sister can be hard to live with sometimes.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Sometimes? How about always?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listen, empathize, but don't expect them to see reason. You might say: “You have to understand that she is younger than you. You need to try not to get so upset by what she does.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The above talk almost always backfires: “See, it's exactly what I've been saying. She gets you to believe everything she says and you don't see it at all.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More useful is to look at yourself. Is there anything that you are doing that is feeding the conflict? Does one or the other get significantly more attention – because she's a star, or because she's the opposite, the one who needs more academic or social support?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If so, be vigilant about giving equal time and attention – and praise. And make sure that you have at least some – it does not have to be that long – regular one-on-one time with each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be honest with yourself. Have you in some way favoured one over the other, or not always been completely fair? If so, it is good to own up to it: “If at times I have been more critical of you than of your sister, that was unfair. I'll try not to in the future.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The above goes a long way to ease resentment: “Yeah, that's what I've been telling you. So can I get some money to go to the mall?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last, when they do battle, stop it. Separate them – earlier, rather than later. You want to head off bullying and talk that is damaging. You can't stop it from happening when you aren't there, but you can stop it now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then one day, a funny thing happens. As they move into young adulthood, little by little the bad feelings recede. Adult siblings may not always like each other, but more often than not, it is because of adult issues and conflicts, not leftover teen resentments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The girls' mother was surprised as she observed her elder daughter actually compliment her younger sister's outfit, and then later she spoke in a friendly way about her younger sister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You don't hate her?” asked her mother.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“No.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Why not? What happened? What's different?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don't know. I just don't have those same feelings toward her any more. She's changed. I've changed. We're not kids any more.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teenaged hatred can be very real. But more often than not – it can seem like a miracle – it goes away. It just isn't there any more. Gone. And now they're best friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're buying matching outfits. Don't you think we look good?”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Senate begins hearings on the government's omnibus crime bill, and the almost certain prospect of huge, long-term budgetary increases in the jails moves a step closer, it seems an odd juxtaposition: trying to ensure the long-term health of the retirement security system, and spending like crazy, in the short, medium and long terms, on prison cells.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government is right to be forward-looking – but why does it not question the long-term sustainability of the corrections system? If Canada can talk about the long-term challenges facing health care and seniors' benefits, what about the long-term costs of jail expansion?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2012-13, the federal corrections budget will be $861-million higher than it was 2009-10, a 36-per-cent jump. The extra provincial costs may be larger than the extra federal ones. An already proclaimed law, ending the two-for-one sentencing discount, could cost in the billions each year, Parliamentary Budget Officer Kevin Page says. And Justice Minister Rob Nicholson promises still more toughness on crime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public Safety Minister Vic Toews told a Senate committee this week that if the provinces had better mental-health services, fewer mentally ill people would be turning up in federal prison. “Do we then send [the provinces] a bill and say we have to build new wings in our federal penitentiaries because of your provincial policies?” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a revealing comment. If the federal jails are filling up with the mentally ill, why doesn't the government propose alternatives to building new wings for them, in co-operation with the provinces?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next generation of seniors' benefits is under the spotlight, and ought to be. Many other federal programs face reductions or elimination to get the deficit under control. Alas, no light shines on the costs of the soon-to-be mandatory minimum sentence of six months for growing six marijuana plants, or of other new crime laws. Why is this one area untouchable?</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration's rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline application has focused Canadians on the future of our energy exports. What does this mean for this key sector, and our trading relationships?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reality of world energy demand is that it will increase by a third between 2010 and 2035, and that hydrocarbons will remain dominant – supplying almost three-quarters of global energy needs. Canada should stand to benefit if hydrocarbons remain a key energy source.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To reap these benefits, we need to recognize that less than 10 per cent of this increase in energy demand will come from OECD countries; rather, the drivers of energy demand are emerging economies, particularly in Asia. The sources of energy are also shifting: to unconventional oil and gas and to more unconventional geographies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These realities should cause us to reflect on four propositions:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We should diversify our trade relationships and investment links. The global centre of economic gravity is shifting toward Asia. This year alone, 80 per cent of global growth will come from outside the OECD countries. And yet, 75 per cent of total Canadian exports still go to the United States. No dynamic emerging economy accounts for even 1 per cent, except China at less than 4 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We need to become a nation of traders and a global trade leader. This will require innovative trade and investment agreements with a select group of dynamic emerging economies that are complementary to our economic strengths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We shouldn't have all our energy eggs in one basket. The U.S. is, in practical terms, the only market for our oil and gas exports, and basic economics suggests you seldom maximize the value of what you're selling when there's only one buyer for your products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The longer-term security of demand for our oil is affected by the U.S. willingness to permit pipelines – like the rejected Keystone project – to carry our increasing capacity to export unconventional oil. The International Energy Agency projects U.S. oil consumption to decline significantly by 2035, and China will substantially surpass it as the world's largest energy consumer. The ability to fully develop our unconventional oil and gas capacity will hinge on our access to Asian markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We should be seeking a more strategic approach to our energy future. Although Canada's energy sector is one of our core economic advantages, there's no consistent and concerted game plan for its development. When the national interest is so clearly at stake, the need for clear strategies to shape the new global reality to our best advantage seems evident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We need leadership, anchored by our national interests. There are inevitable linkages and trade-offs among economic growth, energy use, environmental stewardship and standard-of-living objectives. The challenge is to address these trade-offs, and do so with the goal of improving Canada's long-term prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leadership is all the more imperative because of the risks and opportunities we face in such a key sector at such a pivotal time. Our risk may be national complacency, and our riskiest choice may be the status quo. Shaping our energy future will require leadership – from all of us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Prime Minister Stephen Harper told the World Economic Forum in Davos that his government is making it a priority to ensure we have the capacity to export our energy products to Asia. Next week, he travels to Beijing. The Obama administration's Keystone decision will ensure that oil tops the agenda.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initially, your pampered correspondent was a tad skeptical about what seemed too much publicity and too many photo ops surrounding Jagrup Brar's high-profile attempt to survive for a month on welfare. But as the days progressed, I grew more appreciative of the MLA's dogged determination to do it right, his modestly expressed sympathy for those with so much less, and not pretending that he had discovered poverty. There was very little, if any, grandstanding from the stolid Mr. Brar.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I also liked his acknowledgement of the humanity he found among the hardscrabble residents of the Downtown Eastside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They knew I am an MLA, that I am not poor. But they understood what I was doing, and knew this month I had no money,” he told the Vancouver Sun's Gerry Bellett. “These people are poor themselves, yet they each wanted to give me $5.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brar has now returned to his family and comfortable life in Surrey. But the experience changed him as a person, he says, and I believe him. Well done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I like a good joke when I know about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I happily turn a chunk of my struggling column over to our Premier for a breath of real humour, one that's drawn laughter among very different audiences – truck loggers last month, and powerful women executives this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seems that Christy Clark's son, Hamish, an atom minor hockey goalie, asks his mom at just about every practice for some new equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And,” she explained to her audience of women on Wednesday, “every time, I have the same answer for him. I say: ‘Hamish … I am not going to buy you something you don't need and we can't afford just to get you to shut up.'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a later practice, Hamish looks around and says, “Mom, they've got these great new goalie masks, and I really want [one].”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The young man knows what's coming, however. He plays his trump card.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As related by his mother the Premier: “Okay, Mom, I know the drill. I don't need it. We can't afford it, and you're not going to buy it for me just to get me to shut up. So here's the thing. I want Adrian Dix to take me to hockey practice.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yuk yuk yuk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly on a roll, Ms. Clark tried for another laugh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The B.C. Liberal Party has had some pretty tough times, and without them, I wouldn't be here,” she said. This time, silence.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview with ex-Globe reporter Ian Mulgrew, now at another newspaper, Mr. Krog first asked the reporter if he were sitting down. Then he offered: “Bond is a pretty capable minister, even if she has no legal training.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During my time in China, relatively early in that country's relentless destruction of its heritage in favour of ugly skyscrapers and traffic jams, I became entranced with its ongoing passion for those decorative objects falling from the neck and spilling down the chest, otherwise known as ties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Day after day, there they were in the China Daily, the Communist-controlled English-language paper that ran a story once with the delightful headline: “Officials urged to be honest.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May I humbly share a few headlines to illustrate this strange tie obsession. (Get on with it, ed.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Caribbean ties show promise”; “Sino-Nepal neighbourly ties hailed”; “Sino-French ties to improve”; “Indonesia urged to treasure China ties”; “China, Mali ties time-tested”; “Slovak ties to flourish”; “Bulgarian ties to be enhanced”; “Majority of Chinese expect better ties”; “Sino-Canadian ties firmer.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do what you want</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm curious why you are asking for advice: Are you too timid to have a relationship with your daughter and grandchild without him? It's your daughter and your grandchild – have whatever relationship you want with them, including inviting them to your home. If your husband doesn't like it, you have a different problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patricia MacDonald,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North Bay, Ont</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">.Make a choice</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Someone once said, “there are no illegitimate children, only illegitimate parents.” Guess which one your husband is? This choice is painfully obvious. My guess is that if you choose your daughter he will change his thinking – or else you will have sped up the inevitable breakup of your marriage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Forsey, London, Ont.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Include them both</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are bonds between a mother and daughter that transcend the bonds with the second (or third) husband. You should make it clear that love forgives and your love for your daughter and husband means that you will include both in your life, even if it means spending time with each independently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ian Galton, Barrie, Ont.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE FINAL WORD</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Snow White had the same problem as your daughter. She was a model citizen, loved domestic servitude and firmly believed in sex after marriage, but all for naught: She was despised by her stepparent anyway. Is your husband not the fairest of them all? I kid, I kid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You're caught between two very important people in your life. But Ian's right: Bonds between mother and child are forever, come bad boyfriends or high water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yes, as Patricia says, you have an absolute right to visit your daughter whenever you want. But let's ease into that scenario. Your husband sounds like a guy without a lot of hobbies or friends and you're the centre of his tiny, emotionally dependent universe. He's going to need time to change his attitude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reassure him that this marriage is a priority for you and you want it to thrive. That may mean spending extra time doing things he loves – date night, fly fishing, demonstrating correct condom use. Building up a bank of goodwill will help neutralize some of the hostility, and give you opportunities to open up the conversation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And despite Mike's take, let's not choose between them yet. Your daughter is in your life, but she doesn't have to be in your husband's. This can be a good thing. Once, while visiting my mother with my two-year-old son, he reached into his diaper, pulled out a piece of poo the size of a small poodle and plopped it onto her pristine kitchen table. After the screaming subsided, my mother told me that, for the next little while, she'd visit me in my own home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With time and effort, your husband will realize that your relationship with your daughter isn't going away and more importantly, not affecting his relationship with you. Let's hope he'll be more open to her presence in your home. But keep the pooper scooper handy.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chances of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's fall and an opposition takeover are growing, despite the rebels' own divisions. Unrest now embraces some 30 urban centres; if Damascus and Aleppo rise up, the results will be catastrophic for the regime. The Baath Party's demise, to be welcomed in the struggle for human rights and pluralism, is also fraught with challenges. A United Nations Security Council resolution would be a key symbolic gain for progressives, but alone will have little, if any, effect on the ground in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The popular Arab uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, combined with the consequences of the ill-fated U.S. intervention in Iraq, have already shifted the strategic balance of power in the region between nations and communities, unlike anything seen since the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War. Nor can Shia-dominated Iran be ignored in its competition with the region's Sunni Arab majority, a rivalry centuries long.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. al-Assad's demise will end Syria's secular tradition, of value in itself no matter how corrupt and repressive the regime has been, as many Syrian Christians will testify. It will bring about Sunni domination over substantial minority communities, including Alawites, Christians, Druze, Kurds and others. The revolt is not led by Islamists, nor was it in Egypt or elsewhere. But it's more than likely that Syria's Sunni domination will yield to Muslim Brotherhood rule, with that movement's organizational strength and ideological agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unhappily, the widely shared Western conceptions that change in the name of pluralism would invariably succeed in the aftermath of the Arab Spring looks to be proved naive. A much murkier reality has emerged. While frustration with an abusive and ossified status quo has led to revolution, the consequences clash dramatically with the vision of the progressive movements that unseated the secular autocrats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emerging Islamist governments could prove to be relatively benign. But early indicators are less than reassuring. Israel, not unexpectedly, is already the subject of further demonization for its policies respecting Palestinians and, at a deeper level, for its very existence as a Jewish state. Mosque sermons are increasingly fiery, and Muslim Brotherhood leaders are caustic. This does not mean military confrontation or an abrogation of peace treaties. But it does mean a still more hostile Arab street, a re-energized Hamas and a weakened Palestinian Authority, unable to take further risks for peace lest it be labelled Zionist sellouts to an Israeli government where accommodation with Palestinians often seems anathema.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Israel is ambivalent about the current rulers in Damascus. The Baath Party has been hostile in rhetoric and has fostered low-level confrontation with the Jewish state, but has generally been predictable and risk-averse. For Israel, the prospect of Sunni rule in Syria causes intense worry about chaos in an already fragile Arab society, and fear about forced confrontation with an Islamist government in Damascus. This raises the question of whether the Lebanese-based Shia group Hezbollah, which is dependant on Mr. al-Assad, will retreat in the face of a Sunni-ruled Damascus or pursue more active confrontation with Israel in a bid to reinforce its revolutionary credentials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iran would be a major loser should the al-Assad regime fall. It's heavily reliant on a sympathetic Syrian government in its own pursuit of a Shia-dominated crescent through Iraq to Lebanon. Should Hezbollah turn inward toward conventional politics in Beirut, Tehran would lose much of its regional influence. If Syria fragments, its various communities will be driven toward civil war. Lebanon, dramatically fragmented itself, will be drawn in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Majority Sunni treatment of the minority Shiites has historically been less than generous throughout the region, exemplified by Shia subjugation in Iraq under Saddam Hussein and in Saudi Arabia, where restrictions on Shia places of worship, education and identity are severe. Among the most vocal indicators of animosity between these faiths was Saudi King Abdullah's remark to senior Americans in 2008, urging them to “cut off the head of the snake” by attacking Iran. Shiites differ from Sunnis in doctrine, ritual, law, theology and organization to a depth difficult for most Canadians to imagine. Both share a primordial distrust of the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current situation in the Middle East is incredibly complex. Today's reality contains so many variables that it's impossible to predict an ultimate outcome. What can be said categorically is that tumult and chaos will be the region's leitmotif for the foreseeable future. No player in the international community will fail to feel the consequences.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They may not be as noble as the Nobel Prize or as rare as Olympic gold, the Oscars, which are three weeks away, are the apex of glamour-monkey congratulation spectacles. But what are we to make of all those other, more obscure award announcements that fill the Monday morning briefs columns this time of year? The pre-Oscar race overflows with acronym-ity – The PGAs, DGAs and SAGs.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to reading the Oscar race momentum, these awards matter. Unlike prizes picked by journalists (The Golden Globes and the Critics Choice Awards), these are votes that reflect the tastes of people working in the entertainment industry. The guild awards can be useful advance polls on what the 6,000-odd members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences are thinking. So far, the guild prizes have told us two things: The Oscars crowd will likely give loud applause to a silent best picture, The Artist, and George Clooney and Meryl Streep may not get to recycle their Golden Globe acceptance speeches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's what's happened so far: At the Producers Guild of America (Jan. 21), the producers gave the best-picture prize to The Artist from a shortlist of 10 nominees. Consider it a strong possibility that the Academy Award will follow. The PGA has more than 4,750 producers in TV and film, of whom 450 are academy members. That's a large and significant sample size. The PGA and the Oscars have agreed on the best-picture choice for 15 of the past 22 years, including the last four years in a row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last weekend, meanwhile, the Directors Guild of America weighed in, picking France's Michel Hazanavicius (The Artist) as its favourite auteur. Expect him to repeat at the Oscars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the more than 14,000 film and television directors in the DGA, 367 are in the directors' branch of the academy. The directors are particularly reliable indicators of the academy's taste, with the DGA's choice of best director going on to win the Oscar on 50 of 63 occasions – or 79 per cent of the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, last Sunday we saw the Screen Actors Guild awards. The actors' group gave its equivalent of the best picture – the best ensemble performance – to the Southern civil-rights-era drama The Help. The best actor prizes went to Jean Dujardin for The Artist and Viola Davis for The Help. Best supporting actor went to Christopher Plummer for Beginners and best supporting actress to Octavia Spencer for The Help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAG has about 100,000 members, with 1,183 of them in the acting branch of the academy. Their choices tend to be sentimental favourites. The best ensemble award for The Help is not much of an indicator of Oscars' best picture choice. To date, SAG has predicted the best-picture Oscar winner only eight out of 17 times</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interesting developments here are SAG's choices for best actor and actress. George Clooney (for best actor in The Descendants) and Meryl Streep (for best actress in The Iron Lady) were supposed to be sure bets, but after the SAG awards were handed out, book-makers had to scramble to rewrite the odds. In the past 17 years, 13 of SAG's best-actor winners and 12 of the best-actress winners went on to repeat at the Oscars. Drop both Clooney and Streep down to underdog status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the best-supporting categories, they were simply confirmations of the obvious. In both supporting acting categories, SAG and the Oscars have agreed 10 out of 17 times, a percentage that's about to increase this year. Both Plummer and Spencer can start making room on their mantles for the bald golden man to join the Golden Globe, Critics Choice and SAG prizes they've already won.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's something to chew on as debate heats up over Canada's poor innovation record.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians are among the biggest consumers of pharmaceuticals in the world, the costs for which are also among the highest in the world. And yet, despite these consumption and cost patterns, coupled with patent protection for brand-name pharmaceuticals, Canada lags way behind in the volume of research and development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Courtesy of the annual reports of the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB), we can trace what's been happening. And the picture is dispiriting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In exchange for expanded patent protection in 1987 (bringing Canada into conformity with international norms), Canada's Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies pledged to increase their ratio of R&amp;D to sales to 10 per cent by 1996. These brand-name companies did that, and more. By 1996, the ratio had jumped to 12.3 per cent. The next year, it hit a record 12.7 per cent. The ratio has been declining ever since; it dipped below 10 per cent in 2004 and slumped to 8.2 per cent in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If R&amp;D had remained at 10 per cent, these companies would have spent another $1.2-billion over the past eight years. But their specific commitment ran out in 1996. Worse for them, some of the patents on big blockbuster drugs have begun to expire. (Lipitor, the best-selling anti-cholesterol drug, lost its patent last year.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When drugs lose their patents, generics replace them – sometimes produced directly by the brand-name companies or under contract, more often by a generic drug company. Whatever happens, prices fall. In addition, the PMPRB regulates prices such that patented drug prices can't grow by more than the consumer price index over a three-year period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are no new blockbuster patented drugs hitting the market, here or elsewhere. So the companies try to rearrange the chemical formulas in products and seek patents for drugs very similar to the ones losing patent protection. If they succeed in securing a patent for this new but similar drug, they can ride the profits of this new patent for its duration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With prices held down by the PMPRB and patented drugs losing market share, it's hard to explain why drugs cost so much. Part of it relates to the absurd Canadian system whereby each province negotiates prices; part of it is because drug use overall has skyrocketed; and part of it is tied to these new patents for drugs being not very different from the previously patented ones. Drug expenditures in Canada from 2000 to 2008 grew at twice the growth in the economy (6.4 per cent), faster than anywhere else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While sales rise, R&amp;D declines. The ratio of R&amp;D to sales rose from 2000 to 2008 in France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the United States and Britain, but fell in Canada. Indeed, studying the pattern of R&amp;D to sales leads inevitably to the conclusion that head office location counts. Countries with pharmaceutical head offices definitely get more R&amp;D than branch plant countries such as Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some of these countries with much greater R&amp;D, patented drug prices are below those in Canada, meaning that no link exists between research intensity and domestic prices. In turn, this means Canada has the worst of both worlds: high prices, internationally speaking, with a low R&amp;D intensity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brand-name drug companies have been extensive users of the research tax credits on offer from federal governments (augmented sometimes by provincial ones). These have come under assault from two federal studies into Canada's lagging innovation. It would appear the Harper government is prepared to shake up this credit, which has been widely attacked as ineffective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reasons why R&amp;D in pharmaceuticals has disappointed are many, and the companies certainly have their long list of laments. But the statistics illustrate that Canadian efforts haven't produced the intended results. The country is being short-changed relative to what it pays for drugs, how it protects them under patent, and compared with what happens in comparable countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in case anyone rushes to the defence of generic (off-patent) drug companies, Canadians pay among the highest prices for generic drugs in the world, in addition to the highest prices for patented drugs. It's another example of having the worst of both worlds.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. researchers have moved a step closer to being able to interpret or “read” the thoughts of patients who are no longer capable of speaking.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The promising work could lead to the development of electronic devices to help these patients communicate with family, friends and caregivers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is huge for patients who have damage to their speech mechanisms because of a stroke or Lou Gehrig's disease and can't speak,” said the study's senior author, Robert Knight of the University California, Berkeley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a paper published this week in the journal PLoS Biology, the researchers reported they have been able to “decode the electrical activity,” in the superior temporal gyrus, a part of the brain's auditory system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a person listens to spoken language, the brain breaks down the sounds into various frequencies and translates the information into specific electrical signals, explained the study's lead author, Brian Pasley, a postdoctoral researcher at the university. In a similar fashion, the act of speaking also produces a unique pattern of electrical activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By gaining a greater understanding of these processes – and learning how to decipher these signals – the researchers believe it may be possible to know what a person is hearing or intends to say simply by monitoring brain activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For their study, the researchers enlisted the help of 15 patients who were undergoing exploratory surgery for the treatment of severe epilepsy. The patients had part of their skull removed so that electrodes could be placed directly on the cortex or surface of the brain. They remained in hospital for a week while doctors pinpointed the source of their seizures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from epilepsy, the patients were essentially healthy and had normal hearing and speech.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By agreeing to be part of the study, they provided the researchers with a wealth of information. In fact, each patient had an average of 64 electrodes covering the cortex and one individual had 256 of the sensing devices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their brain activity was recorded as they listened to words and segments of conversation. Using this data, Dr. Pasley then created a computer program that could reconstruct and play back the sounds encoded in the electrical activity of the brain. The reproduced sounds were far from perfect, but the work suggests it may be possible to decode these signals in a fairly reliable fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers cautioned that they still have a lot more work to do. “We are looking at the very early stages of a long and complicated process,” Dr. Pasley said. Even so, there is reason to believe that if a person can imagine talking – even if he can't utter a word – that brain activity can be picked up and interpreted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The general principle is that the area in the brain that performs the task is also activated when you imagine doing the task,” Dr. Knight said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, earlier studies have shown it is possible to move objects – such as a cursor on a computer screen – with electrodes hooked up to the brain. Just thinking about the action makes it happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, if researchers can decipher the signals governing speech, “you could synthesize the actual sound a person is thinking, or just write out the words with a type of interface device,” Dr. Pasley speculated. The procedure, though, would likely require an invasive operation – with electrodes permanently implanted into the brain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blood pressure difference a sign of trouble</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the blood pressure measurement in your right arm is significantly different than that in your left arm, then you could be at an elevated risk of a heart attack or stroke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British researchers analyzed 20 studies covering differences in systolic blood pressure – or the pressure exerted on blood vessels when the heart is contracting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their findings, published in The Lancet, showed that a difference of 15 mm Hg (millimetres of mercury) or more between arms indicates the patient is likely suffering from partly clogged and obstructed arteries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In healthy individuals, blood pressure is normally equal on both sides of the body, said lead researcher Christopher Clark of the Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry at the University of Exeter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The blood vessels in both arms are, of course, connected to the same circulation,” he said. “So there must a narrowing [in one or more places] to cause the drop in pressure.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Clark and his fellow researchers believe doctors should take blood pressure readings in both arms as part of routine medical examinations. It's a relatively simple and inexpensive method for identifying patients who may need additional evaluation. And for patients already being treated for cardiovascular disease, it could be a sign they require extra therapy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The science behind massage</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For thousands of years, various forms of massage therapy have been used to relieve tired and aching muscles. Now modern science has helped to explain why it feels so good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hands-on manipulation triggers biochemical sensors that send inflammation-reducing signals to muscle cells, according to a study by researchers at McMaster University in Hamilton and the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore, the signals boost the ability of muscles' cells to make new mitochondria – the power-production centres within cells – which can affect muscle endurance, said the study's senior author, Mark Tarnopolsky of McMaster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the study, 11 young men peddled vigorously on stationary bicycles for 70 minutes. Afterward, each volunteer received a 10-minute massage – but only on one leg. The other leg was rested. Muscle biopsies were collected on both legs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A detailed analysis of the biopsies revealed evidence of the signals to reduce inflammation and increased mitochondria production in the massaged leg. “I didn't think that little bit of massage could produce that remarkable of a change,” said Justin Crane, a McMaster doctoral student who led the study published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the study also challenged one long-held belief about massage. Some exercise specialists have assumed that massage aids the recovery of fatigued muscle by helping to flush away lactic acid, a byproduct of exercise. That is not case, Dr. Tarnopolsky said, noting there was no difference in the lactic acid levels in the massaged and unmassaged leg.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 77, he has produced an album that is beautiful, magnificent, moving. It is as if his entire career were a preparation for the 10 songs on Old Ideas.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Old, as in timeless. Love, sex, death, God.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And how much the world owes to an unscrupulous manager who stole millions from Mr. Cohen, after which he undertook, in his seventies, a two-year, 247-show tour, three hours a night in 30 countries (he collapsed on stage in Spain, was turned away from Gaza, wowed them in Croatia and New Zealand). As a result, he reconnected with his audience, and with the sources of his art, and continued to grow as an artist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a decade he was a kind of hermit, until forced to repair his fortunes, he says. “And this was a most fortunate happenstance. Suddenly I was dealing with living musicians and then with living audiences and, yes, it did have a great effect. And I think it warmed some part of my heart that had taken on a chill.” Who says an artist, or anyone, should ever stop growing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The essence of his art, or his obsessions, has never changed much, but reaches full expression in his first three songs, Going Home, Amen and Show Me the Place, all deeply spiritual and steeped in thoughts of death, though marked by humour. “I love to speak with Leonard,” God says in one song, “a lazy bastard living in a suit.” He tangles with God and finally, makes his peace – almost. “Show me the place/where you want your slave to go. . . . Help me roll away the stone. . . . I can't move this thing alone.” And thank goodness for that heavy stone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cohen is Canada's gift. He grew up in a semi-detached brick home in Montreal, a Jewish, fatherless boy, became a bestselling poet, a wonderful novelist, a singer known in the 1960s for Suzanne, and in the 1980s for Hallelujah – many years later, in 2008, three versions of it held positions at the same time on Britain's Top 40. He belongs to the world.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sign number 28,542 of the approaching apocalypse: Last week, ComScore.com, an online tracking service, reported that the rapacious middlebrow British tabloid the Daily Mail has quietly unseated The New York Times as the most-read online newspaper in the world. The Mail Online hit 45.3 million users in December, beating out the Times's respectable but flagging 44.8 million – no small feat for an online publication that launched just over three years ago.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast to the vast majority of digital newspapers, the Mail website is also raking in the cash, last year turning a reported $24-million in profit, with no paywall, no teams of crack Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists, no shame whatsoever in slapping Kim Kardashian's Twitpics all over its home page.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in the middle of the phone-hacking scandal plaguing rival Rupert Murdoch's News International, the Mail is enjoying a bona-fide cultural moment. Partly by virtue of its brand credibility (the Mail sells a staggering 4.5 million print copies a day), its Web arm now claims the title of world's cleanest dirt disher, attracting scads of readers from London to Aberdeen and from L.A. to Sydney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The genius of Mail Online is that it has figured out exactly how to package stupid content for smart people. And surprise, surprise – we can't get enough of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the thoughtful, stalwart New York Times, which prides itself on maintaining its Grey Lady brand across platforms, the splashy, celebrity-obsessed Mail Online looks and feels almost nothing like its arch-conservative, domestically focused print incarnation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Put together by a transatlantic staff of just over 50 employees, the site reads haphazardly, like a palimpsest of publications transposed crazily on top of one another. There's nothing clear or pretty about it, and yet the effect is as addictive as a nicotine-soaked, deep-fried hit of crack. A sensual bombardment of images and information, from hard news to celebrity cellulite, begs to be clicked on one bottomless scroll bar that descends all the way down to hell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mail Online has essentially nailed the guilty pleasure. It's the Internet's best source of uncut, class-A celebrity gossip that's neither overtly camp (like, say, PerezHilton.com), aggressively shouty (TMZ) nor cringingly snide (Gawker). As providers of dross go, it's the lesser evil for bored professionals hoping to kill 15 minutes without needing a soul-cleansing shower afterward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its deeper genius is in setting a tone through eclectic – some might say morally contradictory – content. You might go to the site to read about Gordon Ramsay's rancid feud with his in-laws, but you end up reading about Kate and Will's new puppy and a good Samaritan who rugby-tackled a little old lady's mugger. You might even click on the story about the British foreign secretary's visit to war-torn Somalia. (But let's face it, probably not.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This tension in content between high and low, smart and silly, makes even the most salacious Mail stories feel sharable. And in this great age of social networking, sharability is all: If a Tumblr video of a kitten licking an ice-cream cone is posted on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, but there's no one there to tweet it, does it really exist?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mail Online understands this. First, online readers find the lurid/funny/bizarre item. Then, they feel vaguely ashamed for enjoying it. Then, they share it so that their so-called friends and followers can waste their time in turn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the folks at The New York Times heard they'd been dethroned by a tatty tabloid run by a skeleton crew, they were not amused. Spokesperson Eileen Murphy dismissed the ComScore figures, saying the Mail unfairly counted traffic to its personal-finance site, and insisting the Times remains “the No. 1 individual newspaper site in the world.” Speaking to <span class="companylink">BuzzFeed</span>, she sounded pretty defensive, sniffing, “It almost doesn't need to be said, but the Daily Mail is not in our competitive set.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not so sure. In the intellectually promiscuous digital landscape, distinctions between high- and lowbrow media look blurrier by the day. Discerning readers want to be edified, of course, but they also want to be entertained. If they can get that midday serotonin hit from a site that manages (or even just appears) to do both, why not?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go back online to share the latest news on Gordon Ramsay, and his long-awaited legal truce with his wife's philandering dad.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE QUESTION</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marke Slipp of Wolfville, N.S., wonders how fast we Earthlings are hurtling through space, considering the speed at which the Earth spins on its axis, the speed at which the Earth orbits the sun and how fast the universe is expanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ANSWER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're travelling at 1,332,000 kilometres an hour, says Mike Hudson of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Waterloo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How did he arrive at this figure? First of all, he explains, you have to have a point of reference. “Usually when we ask how fast something – such as a car – is moving, it is assumed to be relative to the surface of the Earth. In the case of our own Milky Way galaxy in the expanding universe, we might ask how fast we are moving compared with other galaxies.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the universe is expanding evenly, he says, each galaxy will see every other one moving away from it – observers on each galaxy will think they are at rest and the others are moving. However, the universe's expansion is not even, so some parts will appear to move faster than others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This greater velocity (compared with the average expansion) is something we can measure, and it's very fast,” he writes.” The sun is moving at 1,332,000 kilometres an hour compared with a distant horizon defined by the cosmic microwave background radiation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This speed is made up of three velocities – the sun's motion around the centre of the Milky Way galaxy (792,000 km/h), the Milky Way's speed while approaching our nearest neighbour, Andromeda (442,800 km/h), and the speed at which both the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are moving compared with the background radiation (2,160,000 km/h).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These three speeds don't add up to 1,332,000 km/h, however, because the velocities are heading in different directions. Some add, some partly add and some partly subtract. Meanwhile, the speed at which the Earth rotates on its axis (1,656 km/h at the equator) and the Earth's orbital velocity around the sun (108,000 km/h) are relatively small.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE QUESTION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why are beer cans 355 millilitres but beer bottles only 341 millilitres? Mike Maher of Montreal wants to know.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ANSWER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's because 12 fluid ounces in the U.S. system is equivalent to 355 ml, while 12 fluid ounces in our imperial system is 341 ml, says George Ollerhead of London, Ont. He says the 355 ml format was adopted here to match the size of cans sold in the United States, where canned beer was initially more popular. Returnable bottles, however, stuck with the 341 ml format, in keeping with the imperial measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.J. Schipper of Toronto adds: “Since neither is a normal metric size, we could solve this inconsistency by using the easy-to-understand size used in most countries, which is 330 ml, basically one-third of a litre.”</p>

Forty-one years later, after competing in the A group 20 times, he again found himself not among the elite. That is an adjustment for a player who was frequently ranked third in the world in the late 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Timman had a 50-per-cent score when he played White against Sipke Ernst, one of ten players ahead of Timman in the Dutch ranking list.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Queen's Gambit is safe, because White can regain the pawn. White is more likely to let the pawn go in the Slav Defence, but this is rightly named the Gambit variation of the Réti Opening. There are four main responses. At Wijk aan Zee in 1996, Timman chose 5.Nb1-a3 Qd8-d5 6.O-O g7-g6 7.d2-d4!? (d2-d3) when Michael Adams chose to ignore the gambit 7…c4xd3 e.p. 8.Nf3-g5 Qd5-d8 9.Qd1-b3 e7-e6 with compensation. The two other moves are 5.a2-a4, which prevents b7-b5 but creates a weakness at b4, and 5.Qd1-c2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5.O-O Nb8-d7 6.Qd1-c2 Nd7-b6</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main move now is 7.a2-a4, but Black has been scoring well with 7…a7-a5 8.Nb1-a3 Bc8-e6 9.Nf3-g5 and either Qd8-d7 or Be6-g4. The 2009 game between Leon Piasetski and Ernst continued in exactly the latter way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">7.Nb1-a3 Qd8-d5</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crucial path after 7…Bc8-e6 is 8.Nf3-e5 Qd8-d4 9.Ne5xc6!?, a sacrifice with a view to the endgame, introduced by Levan Pantsulaia in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8.b2-b3 c4xb3 9.a2xb3 Bc8-e6</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Black is already a pawn up, perhaps this is a bit obsessive about chasing the little guys. At the 2006 World Junior, Wang Yue continued 9…g7-g6 10.Na3-c4 Qd5-d8 11.Nf3-e5 Nb6-d5 12.e2-e4 against Pantsulaia. Although White built up an impressive pawn wave, Black eventually won. Timman's next move is a novelty. Ra1-b1, Na3-c4, and even d2-d3 have been played, each time with compensation for the pawn.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here comes another opportunity for White.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">24.f4xe5 Be6-f5 25.Ne4xc5 Bf8-g7 26.d3-d4</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">White could heap further insult, winning by cutting Black off from the hinterland with 26.Bc6-d5+ e7-e6 27.Bd5-c6! threatening Nc5-d7, now that d7 is undefended.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Black's last desperate chance was 26…Bf5-h3. Timman finds a hammer blow, worthy of his glory years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">27.Rf1xf5! g6xf5 28.e5-e6+ Kf7-g6 29.Nc5-d7 Nc8-d6</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At issue was the loss of a whole rook at b8. It is pointless to contemplate whether this is worse than 29…Rb8-b6 30.Bc1-f4, intending Bf4-c7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">30.Nd7xb8 Rd8xb8 31.Ra1xa7 Nd6xb5 32.Ra7xe7 Bg7-h6 33.Bc6-e8+</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked afterwards whether, at age 60, he might run down at the end of a long tournament, Timman laughed and said "I don't think about that now". The game proved perhaps more of an inspiration to Timman's next opponent, group B leader Pentala Harikrishna, who sacrificed three pawns in the opening and went on to win.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question Can you suggest a romantic getaway in southern California, preferably on the coast, for late spring?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunsets, surf, that warm California breeze. While the sun does indeed meet the horizon while you're both busy at work, watching it perform its daily duty on the Pacific Coast makes for easy romance. Which is why it's hard to pick just one romantic locale. Here are three from Jennifer Miner, one of the founders of The Vacation Gals, an award-winning travel blog that covers North America and the Caribbean (thevacationgals.com).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• San Diego: “San Diego is the most cosmopolitan of my recommendations for a Southern California romantic escape, but remember – in this part of the world, cosmopolitan still means beachy, unpretentious and chill,” the California resident says. Couple-time pursuits include horseback riding,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">sailing and dining out at such ambience-rich restaurants as Candelas Restaurant (candelas-sd.com) in the Gaslamp Quarter. Spend the night in the historic and elegant US Grant (usgrant.net), Miner recommends. The four-diamond AAA hotel is also in the downtown Gaslamp neighbourhood, close to shopping and nightlife, and it's a short drive to the beach. • Newport Beach: Here, 80 kilometres south of Los Angeles, the beaches are quieter and pastimes include cycling the Newport Pier or Back Bay ecological preserve, Miner says. A highlight? Dining at intimate Pas.tu with its linen tablecloths and hurricane lamps on nearby Balboa Island (pasturestaurant.com).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• La Jolla: Her last pick? The picturesque town of La Jolla (lajollabythesea.com), near the sea and the slopes of Mount Soledad, which is just north of San Diego. “It feels completely different than that larger city,” Miner says. “The town centre is easy to stroll, with many independent antique shops to nose around in. The beaches are lovely, of course.” She recommends the Bed &amp; Breakfast Inn at La Jolla (innlajolla.com), which offers lush grounds, fresh flowers in the rooms and that other key ingredient on a romantic getaway, privacy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, without fuss, the Canadian Forces issued a new policy allowing soldiers to wear the uniform of their target gender. This means that a soldier who is transitioning from, say, male to female is allowed to dress in the uniform designated for a female soldier.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The armed services first began covering gender-reassignment surgery in 1998 and it continues to do so, as do most of the provinces: We treat medical conditions with medical practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While I think we should take the transgender community's word for it – that transitioning works to transform often excruciatingly unhappy gender-dysphoric people into contented people – there are lots of studies that back them up as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hardly something that anyone would do for kicks. Transitioning isn't for sissies, which is why it's heart-warming that our military made a practical and humane decision to accommodate transgender soldiers. And it's also why it's unfortunate that since July, 2011, a Department of Transport rule has been on the books that could prevent those same transitioning soldiers from flying home for Christmas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The existence of this rule was brought to light this week by blogger Jennifer McCreath. It states that if “a passenger does not appear to be of the gender indicated on the identification he or she presents,” that person is not allowed to fly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm prepared to believe those who say transgender and inter-sex people aren't the demographic the rule aims to catch, but that leaves me wondering who it is the authorities are trying to nab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm trying to imagine the target villain here. I guess it's a man who, driven by some combination of madness, mangled religious ideology and political motivation, decides that he must board a plane and commit a ghastly crime. We've seen this before. But this guy would have to be different.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He'd be a little more unusual than your average suicide bomber because, in order for this rule to prevent him from killing anyone, he would, for reasons known only to himself, have to feel compelled to commit this crime while wearing a dress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This guy's not travelling on a false passport – not if this rule is for him. That was already a crime. And his passport tells us he's not on a no-fly list, which doesn't say, “Cut the guy some slack if he's wearing something pretty,” so no net gain in arrests there. If he is travelling on a false passport, he skates close to the edge because, unlike every other suicide bomber ever, he's not trying to slip under the radar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No, this terrorist has added yet another layer of danger to his mission because, in getting a forged passport that marks him as a male when he presents as female, he's not only risking getting nailed by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, he's risking getting the crap kicked out of him in the airport parking garage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's inviting extra questions at Customs! Who does that? Clearly he's hoping that by attempting to commit an atrocious crime while posing as a member of one of the most scorned and misunderstood groups in society, he'll have an advantage. Because he is an idiot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Ah,” I hear you say. “But how do you know this woman with an M on her passport isn't a suicide bomber?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, I don't. But given that, statistically, trans-youth, for example, have one of the highest rates of suicide of any demographic in North America, they strangely enough represent only a tiny fraction of documented suicide bombers: In fact, none. So a rule that makes their lives still more difficult without making anyone else's life safer is wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, as the rule stands, trans people may fly if they have a doctor's letter. If they're post-op, or have an operation scheduled within the year, they may get an amended passport. However, many trans people never have gender-reassignment surgery, or wait years to do so. We don't demand that other groups get doctor's letters in order to fly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the rule is unacceptable even if trans and inter-sex people weren't intentionally targeted. Being oblivious to a minority doesn't make discriminating against them defensible. The excuse that “we didn't even consider you, and relax, this rule hasn't, so far, been enforced” isn't tolerated in other areas. It shouldn't be here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I assume it'll be amended. But, ultimately, the decent thing to do is what some other countries – Spain, South Africa and Britain among them – have done: Let's allow a transgender woman, for example, regardless of which private medical procedures she has undergone, to mark her passport “F,” and go on.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laurin Liu participated in her first political panel on national television not long ago. It was an all-female panel, and the 21-year-old rookie NDP MP from Quebec was keen to debate the issues.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What happened next took her aback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I sit down and the first thing the host says is, ‘What a hot panel we've got tonight' … and this is a male host. It's my first national panel… ,” recalls Ms. Liu, who laughs about it now. “And then it just clicked. I'm in Ottawa and this is the way it is.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sadly, this is the way it still is for women on Parliament Hill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last May, after the general election, women's groups were cheering the fact that 25 per cent of the MPs elected were female.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Liu, a McGill University student, was part of the Orange Wave that saw 59 NDP MPs – nearly half of whom are women – elected in Quebec. It was on the strength of the party's victory in the province that it was propelled to official-opposition status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the much-sought standard of 30-per-cent representation of women in the Commons has yet to be achieved, the 2011 result was considered a breakthrough. Women's representation had stagnated around 20 per cent for two decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's not just a numbers game. Ms. Liu, the party's deputy environment critic and a quick study, still sees obstacles. She says she needs to have a thicker skin than her male colleagues. She feels she has to work harder, know her facts better and be more prepared than the male MPs “to win credibility.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have seen my male colleagues interact with other male politicians,” she says. “I hate to say – it may just be just my imagination – but they seem to have an easier time at it. If you look and talk like a politician, then you are automatically given the credibility as a politician.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Liu's impressions of what it is to work as a woman in the Commons are not unlike those of women MPs from 20 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years before Ms. Liu was born, Mary Clancy was elected the Liberal MP for Halifax. She was one of only 39 female MPs among 176 men.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Re-elected in 1993, Ms. Clancy was one of 53 women MPs. This was a milestone election, too, in which female representation jumped to 18 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was good and we were delighted that we had increased our numbers but there still were amazing barriers … ” she recalls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was the female MP in 1993 who almost missed a vote because she was desperately searching around Centre Block for a bathroom. Unbelievably, there were no women's facilities close to the chamber.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Clancy and her female colleagues found a simple solution – the very large men's washroom, located just steps away from the House, was subdivided to accommodate a new facility for women MPs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was more – a female MP was mugged on the Hill, so more lighting was added, as was more security.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was things like that … very pedestrian stuff,” Ms. Clancy says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they were important victories, as was the Liberal women's success in the late Eighties in having a presence in Question Period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you want to get the women's vote you've got to give us more,” Ms. Clancy recalls telling senior Liberals. “They hemmed and hawed and they whistled and sang but they didn't do anything.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberal women boycotted Question Period one day – after that, they got their fair share of questions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women MPs may get their share of questions now but they're not getting their fair share of power – Stephen Harper's front bench isn't exactly female-friendly. His most senior ministers – Defence, Justice, Finance, Treasury Board, Trade and Foreign Affairs – are all men.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We absolutely need to ensure that women not only get elected but actually succeed and thrive in their elected positions,” says Nancy Peckford, executive director of Equal Voice, the non-partisan association that promotes women running for elected office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is confident this will happen over time, believing that over the next two elections women will achieve one-third representation in the Commons. With 407 women candidates, the most ever, running for federal office in last May's election, Ms. Peckford predicts the country is on the “cusp of a breakthrough.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Canadians are in a different place in how they relate to women in politics,” she says, noting that polling data show Canadians want more women in politics and have a “better understanding of what women bring to the table.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Liu, meanwhile, is not expecting those barriers to come down any time soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think it will last throughout my lifetime and throughout the lifetime of my kids, unfortunately,” she says. “We are making progress but it is a slow process.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How would you like to go to MIT – for free? You can now. Starting this spring, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will be offering free online courses to anyone, anywhere in the world, through its new digital arm, MITx. These courses will be much more than lectures on videotape. Students will be able to interact with other students online and have access to online labs and self-assessment tools. And here's the really revolutionary part: If you can show you've learned the material, for a small fee, MITx will give you a credential to prove it. No, it's not a full-blown MIT degree. But employers will probably be impressed.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or maybe you want to get a BA, but you're focused and self-directed and not all that interested in hanging around the campus pub. Why waste four years at the Provincial University of the Masses? There must be a better way – and there is. At the non-profit Western Governors University (founded by the governors of 19 U.S. states) – and accredited as a state university in Indiana and Texas, among others – you can get a BA on your own time and at your own speed. The tuition is $6,000 a year and covers as many courses as you want to take.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WGU, which specializes in career-oriented degrees in business, health sciences, teaching and IT, isn't one of those online diploma mills that offer iffy teaching and a degree to anyone who pays the fee. Its standards are high, yet you can get a degree faster and cheaper than at public state schools. It has 30,000 students, most of them adults in their 30s. They earn their bachelor's degrees in an average of 30 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now, online education has been regarded as the poor stepchild of the higher-education world – widely suspected of being a second-rate substitute for the real thing. But that's about to change. The digital revolution is going to disrupt higher education in the same way it's disrupted so many other industries. And it's about time. Higher learning still relies on the medieval model, when scholars gathered in one place to listen to professors lecture at them. It's increasingly expensive, and doesn't do a very good job of delivering what a lot of students want and need in a way that society can afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The digital revolution will make higher education better, cheaper, more accessible, more engaging and far more customized than anything that exists today. It'll also turn our current institutions upside down. For example, there'll always be room for the old-fashioned lecture. But do we really need 10,000 professors in 10,000 classrooms lecturing on the same subject? Why not let students watch the best explainer in the world explain calculus or physics – online, on their own time – and use local professors to work in smaller groups with students? Makes sense – so long as you're prepared to upend the entire professoriate, which is geared to research, not teaching, and is paid accordingly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the real disruption comes when you stop measuring academic accomplishment in terms of seat time and hours logged, and start measuring it by competency. As all employers know, the average BA doesn't certify that the degree-holder actually knows anything. It merely certifies that she had the perseverance to pass the required number of courses. The most subversive element of Western Governors University is that it certifies students by competency, not seat time. In fact, students don't sit in a “class” at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no prescribed curriculum. Students are assessed before each course to see which concepts they already grasp and which ones they need to master. Then they're offered a variety of “learning resources” – textbooks, videos, online simulations, conversations with a tutor – to close the gap. They can complete a course in eight weeks or 80. Routine assessments along the way – and a tough exam at the end – ensure they've mastered the material. As one graduate told Washington Monthly, which recently profiled WGU, “If you can prove your competence, why pay all of that money to sit through something you already know?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WGU was dreamed up in the 1990s by a bunch of state governors who faced the same dilemma Canadian premiers and university presidents face today: how to make higher education fundamentally affordable in an age when public money is increasingly scarce. The demand for higher education is exploding, but so is the cost. And the universities' traditional business models aren't sustainable. Non-elite universities (that is, nearly all of them) spend too many resources on research, prestige, bricks and mortar, and trying to be everything to everyone, and not enough resources on effective teaching and learning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harvard Business School's Clayton Christensen believes higher education is ripe for its great disruptive moment. “America has sought to make higher education available to all through massive spending to subsidize its cost through government and philanthropic funding,” he writes. But that model has reached the end of the line in Canada, too. From now on, universities can expect their funding to be cut, not increased. They need to disrupt themselves, or be disrupted, to survive. The years ahead will be the worst of times for higher education – but also the best.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American statesman Dean Acheson once acidly quipped that Canadians discussing foreign affairs reminded him of listening to the “stern daughter of the voice of God.” Canadians, he implied, were pious moralists, ready to give free, often unwanted advice, based on the assumption that Canadians possessed a rare insight into good and proper conduct.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, watching the Harper government, foreigners might conclude that Canadians have evolved from pious finger-pointers to truculent finger-pointers, with poses based on presumptive moral superiority toward others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost everything the Harper government does internationally is rooted in impressing domestic audiences, so the truculence that now characterizes Canada's foreign policy has domestic politics in mind. Judging by polling data, this aggressive in-your-face lecturing of others (save for China) appears to be winning some domestic favour, while, naturally, eroding our credibility abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest egregious example of truculent morality was this week's visit by Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird and Finance Minister Jim Flaherty to the West Bank. At a meeting with the most moderate leadership in Palestinian Authority history, the Canadians lectured the Palestinians on the terrible mistake they'd made in seeking United Nations membership, a bid that won strong support in the General Assembly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This unwanted lecture from afar came from a government whose ministers bragged in Israel that “Canada” is the most pro-Israeli country in the world. This is completely wrong. The Harper government may be the most pro-Israeli in the world, but the population is not. Various polls taken in recent years have shown the reverse: Israel is one of the least popular countries among Canadians, a perception that deeply worries many Canadian Jews. (A poll did note this week that nearly half of Canadians surveyed believe Ottawa's policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict “strikes the right balance.”)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Harper government insists it favours a two-state solution, but everyone knows it will do or say nothing to nudge Israel in that direction, or to chastise Israel for doing next to nothing to move in that direction. As a result of this attitude, manifested by the ministers' trip, Canada's reputation has sunk in the Arab world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The week before the West Bank lecture, the Prime Minister was telling Europeans how they should deal with their economic crisis during a speech in Davos. This likely impressed Canadians, but not Europeans. The last thing they need is gratuitous advice from a North American country that, frankly, doesn't count for much in Europe, as anyone who's lived there knows. And the advice is especially unwelcome when it's layered with self-applause by Canadians about how well their economy has done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In climate-change negotiations, the government's palpable disdain for the Kyoto Protocol, coupled with its own deplorable record of inaction against greenhouse-gas emissions, shredded whatever credibility Canada might have aspired to enjoy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Truculent moralizing also is being directed at Sri Lanka, which the Harperites accuse of turning a blind eye to human-rights abuses. This criticism delights Toronto's Tamil community (the largest Tamil diaspora outside southern Asia), whose members the Harper government is striving to mould into a Conservative bloc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a time when Ottawa tried to take an even-handed stand in that troubled country, urging reconciliation and offering help. But now Sri Lanka's Sinhalese-dominated government gets lectures – and a threat that Canada will boycott the next Commonwealth conference there. That possibility so alarmed Britain and Australia that their leaders implored Mr. Harper not to make that threat at the last Commonwealth conference in Perth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When your closest friends react badly to this proclivity for truculent moralizing, imagine what the rest of the world thinks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the Harper government, Canada lost its bid for a Security Council seat – the first time it had ever been defeated. Were a vote held today, chances are Canada would get even fewer votes.</p>

Nor would the severity of Iran's dictatorship be determined by the sensibilities of a small cluster of Republicans along some dusty road in Winnemucca, Nev.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this isn't a perfectly reasonable world. It is, for the most part, a democratic world, and when the calendar turns from governing to campaigning, tactics tend to trump reason, and the global falls to the local.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're at an unfortunate confluence: Just as the world is facing a set of crises, some of its most influential countries have entered election periods. The results are far from ideal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barack Obama and Iran:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current showdown with Iran, involving escalating threats from Washington, Jerusalem and Tehran, began in earnest when Mr. Obama's strategy of engagement and negotiations broke down after a single attempt in October of 2010. It had been a well-considered strategy: Iran was in a position of weakness both domestically and regionally, and intelligence assessments showed that its nuclear program was little more than a bargaining chip. Imitating Ronald Reagan's approach to Moscow, Mr. Obama had the pieces in place to draw Tehran away from the brink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But an election was pending, and American swing voters wanted shows of force, not attempts at détente. As a result, Mr. Obama “has permitted the debate to take place on the right's turf,” writes Trita Parsi, an Iran scholar who's just published an analysis of the President's diplomatic strategy. “In doing so, he has betrayed his own platform of pursuing ‘smart' rather than just ‘tough' policies.” We can only hope reason will return in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Angela Merkel and Europe:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The German Chancellor, I'm repeatedly told by her advisers, fully understands what needs to be done to put the euro zone back in order. It's just that she can't – not until after the next election. And in Germany these days, there's always a next election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Ms. Merkel pretends the risk to Europe is hyperinflation, and calls for spending cuts and tight money. Her response to the downgrading of debt in nine euro zone countries last month was calls for more austerity, even direct German management of the Greek economy – even though ratings agencies had acknowledged that the larger problem was balance-of-payment inequalities and flagging competitiveness. Instead of facing that, she tries to win over voters with a new minimum wage and an anti-nuclear policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">German political scientist Michael Miebach says Ms. Merkel is following “a clever strategy” in which her “Protestant poverty aesthetic” disguises a deliberate evasion of the expensive realities she must face: “The Chancellor is extremely flexible with regard to her political positions, and is able to use this to undercut opposition stances.” But her coalition's in trouble, and she needs to regain a majority. There's an election in the state of Schleswig-Holstein on May 6, then one in Saarland, and then a national vote next year. Talk of expensive realities would drive voters away. So Europe continues to hang in the balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vladimir Putin and Syria:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russia's interests in the Middle East are not, by themselves, all that different from those of Western countries. Moscow seeks functioning markets there, and wants some influence. It has different alliances but is willing to acquiesce in the name of larger stability, as we saw in last year's United Nations Security Council decision on Libya.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But stability is no longer Mr. Putin's goal. Facing a March 4 election, he's selling himself as a potential president who will fight for Slavic interests against Western intrusions – and this often means siding with foreign autocrats. We saw that clearly this week, when he ruled out not only any Security Council resolution that threatens war with Damascus (probably a reasonable move) but also any that imposes serious sanctions or even any that calls on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down. Mr. Putin seems to be resisting anything that might end the bloodshed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's in an election bind, too, with his United Russia party facing unprecedented criticism. But unlike his U.S. and German counterparts, he confronts a larger democratic threat, one he shares with Mr. al-Assad: the prospect of a grassroots protest movement bent on bringing real democracy. That may keep Mr. Putin in campaign mode long after the March vote, and put him permanently at war with reason.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The words deft and daft have been getting a workout of late.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter to The Globe on Jan. 16, Phil Ford discussed Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich, who are fighting tooth and nail to be chosen as this year's U.S. Republican presidential candidate. “I can't decide which of these guys is the most daft,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Britain's Independent on Sunday on Jan. 29, Rupert Cornwell wrote that polls showed two-thirds of voters had a negative view of Gingrich. “Were he a newcomer, a deft campaign might reverse that impression,” Cornwell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the CBC-TV show George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight, the eponymous host asked editor and publisher Douglas Gibson to give viewers a few words favoured by the Scots, in honour of Robert Burns Day. Gibson, author of the entertaining new book Stories About Storytellers, said, “It's bad news if people take a scunner to you, and it's really bad news if they call you daft, and really, really bad news if they call you glaikit.” (Glaikit, dating from the 1400s, means senseless or foolish.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's clear that deft and daft are not synonymous. Deft means skillful. Daft, which may be related to the much later daffy (from the northern English dialect daff, simpleton), means silly or stupid. The first is a compliment and the second is not, unless it's interpreted as a genial salute to one's eccentricity in the way that “you silly dope” can pass for a spousal term of endearment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet daft and deft derive from the same word in Old English, gedaefte, which seems to have had two meanings: mild and gentle, and fit and suitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The “ae” in gedaefte, written as a single intertwined character (a diagraph), was a vowel called “ash,” from a northern European runic letter that looked like a downcast F. This “ae” is believed to have sounded like the short “a” in cat, capable of producing both the short “a” and “e” in modern English. I must admit that whenever I get near such discussions I break into a cold sweat, fearful of being quizzed on the distinctions between the first vowel shift (around 600, when the Anglo-Saxons invaded Britain) and the Great Vowel Shift (early 1400s).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The general feeling is that daft (daffte in Middle English) developed from the sense of gedaefte as mild, gentle and meek. The notion of innocence and inoffensiveness grew by the 1500s into one of being simple-minded and foolish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, deft (defte in Middle English) developed from the sense of fitness or suitability, and by the 1400s had its modern meaning of dexterous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coincidentally, people have been known to grow pleasantly daft on Valentine's Day, which is less than a fortnight away. Reader James Arthur, responding to a recent column about the philtrum and Cupid's bow (both references to the upper lip), passes along the lovely word limerence. “It appears to be a creation of Dorothy Tennov to describe romantic love,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tennov, a U.S. psychologist, had a particular interest in the psychological state of someone who is romantically infatuated with another. She coined limerence to describe this state, and wrote in The Observer in 1977 that the word was entirely her own. “I first used the term ‘amorance,' then changed it back to ‘limerence.' … It has no roots whatsoever. It looks nice. It works well in French. Take it from me, it has no etymology whatsoever.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we may rule out a link to limbic, related to a part of the brain concerned with basic emotion. And, alas, we must reject a link to the limerick, even though that verse form is so often about love.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or must we? A delightful young pair in their prime/ Found each other at just the right time./ Limber limerence led/ To a petal-strewn bed/ And a cordial of lager and lime.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA – -- rmacgregor@globeandmail.com</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is something oddly, distantly familiar with what he is doing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Tavares, the New York Islanders centre who was the NHL's player of the month for January, is working the corners. He spins, he rolls off two checkers, he has his head raised like a cobra in search of opportunity. He works through traffic by keeping everything in so tight to his body they cannot stop him from slipping by. He sees an opening no one else has seen, passes quickly and, instantly, a goal is scored.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is, of course, playing The National Game … but which one?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tavares is only 21 years of age, and though ESPN recently ranked the “Top 25 NHL players under age of 25” and somehow left him off the list, he is today the talk of the league after scoring nine goals and 13 assists in only 13 games last month and rising into the top five in league scoring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is far, far from the fastest player in the game, and yet he is also unstoppable. He works corners as effectively as, but different from, the Sedin twins of the Vancouver Canucks. He has, as Ottawa Senators captain Daniel Alfredsson noted Friday before the Senators and Islanders met in Ottawa, “incredible hands and vision.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where does it come from? Winter or summer? Hockey rink or lacrosse box?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both, the young rising star says. He grew up playing both sports, both exceptionally well. His uncle, also John Tavares, is one of the greatest lacrosse players of all time, a stubborn, strong man who protects the ball as well as any who have ever played he game and is, simply, deadly from anywhere around the net.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The young John Tavares believes that lacrosse gave him talents that transferred perfectly to Canada's better-known national game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People always talk about eye-hand co-ordination,” he says, “and I totally agree with that. The one thing that I have always told people made a huge difference was rolling off checks and moving through traffic and things like that. It's really benefited me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People don't realize how strong he is,” says Islanders defenceman Steve Staios, who thinks Tavares's skills have “been underestimated” by far more than just ESPN.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I grew up always playing against guys a little bit older than me,” says Tavares, “so I had to dig in. And not always being the strongest guy [I] try and use my smarts from my hockey and my lacrosse in being successful.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His success has largely gone unnoticed, says Islanders coach Jack Capuano, as the struggling team itself has largely flown “under the radar.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going unnoticed is something that the youngster has never previously experienced. Once he decided to concentrate solely on hockey, he was a phenomenon, granted special status to play major junior hockey at 15. He was the most valuable player of the 2009 world junior championship held in Ottawa and the No. 1 pick overall in the 2009 NHL entry draft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This sent him to the Islanders, long a troubled franchise in every area from the rink to the ice. There had been some thought that he would want out as soon as possible, but then last fall he surprised the hockey world by signing a six-year contract extension, now making $5.5-million (U.S.) a year – which is approximately 200 times what a good lacrosse professional could expect to make.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was drafted here,” he says. “They gave me a great opportunity to play as an 18-, 19-year-old. That's a unique thing and not a lot of guys get a chance to do it. They put a lot of responsibility and belief in me and I see the culture and our attitude changing every day,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There was no hesitation in not wanting to be an Islander. I want to be part of the future and part of turning this thing around.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His remarkable third-year success – even if he fell short of the ESPN listing that has Jonathan Toews, Sidney Crosby, Nicklas Backstrom and Patrick Kane at the top and even includes the likes of Bryan Little and David Perron – is due in no small part to the fact that he has adapted skills picked up in another game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not by accident that every single NHL team has a group of players – North American as well as European – who gather before each match to work on soccer skills before heading out on their skates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wayne Gretzky long ago credited lacrosse with giving him the idea of going behind the net and setting up his “office” from where he could send out such effective passes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gretzky also believes that there should be no such thing as “summer hockey” – that young athletes should play a variety of games both to teach new skills and, just as importantly, to prevent early burn-out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And John Tavares, NHL player of the month, could be the poster boy for that argument. –</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty-five pounds lighter, Claude (Butch) Harmon walks into a private dining room at Ruth's Chris Steak House in Orlando. Harmon, who coached Tiger Woods from 1993 through 2004 and who works with Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Adam Scott and Natalie Gulbis, stops to inspect the wines on offer. He makes his suggestions and then sits down in the middle of a long dining table, ready to talk golf with a small group of media.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wine is poured and the conversation begins. It continues for 3 1/2 hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harmon, 68, grew up in New Rochelle, N.Y., and comes from golfing royalty. His father, Claude, won the 1948 Masters, was a semi-finalist in the 1945, 1948, and 1953 PGA Championships (then a match-play event) and tied for third place in the 1959 U.S. Open. He was the head pro at the renowned Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, N.Y., and, for years, the winter pro at the equally renowned Seminole Golf Club in Juno Beach, Fla. Harmon and Ben Hogan were close friends as well as fellow competitors. Harmon, born in 1916, died in 1989 of heart failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During dinner, Harmon speaks often of his father and his three golf professional brothers: Craig, Bill, and Dick, who died six years ago this month. Hogan came to their home for barbecues, and wanted his steak cooked just so; in fact, he grilled his own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Hogan's drink was Chivas on the rocks,” Harmon recalls. “He was an introvert. He'd sit at the table and not say much. But he was always great to us. When my dad died, Mr. Hogan was the first person I called.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was more than 20 years ago. Recently, Harmon found himself asking, “What can I leave? I'm going to wind it down. I'll always teach, but I'm not going to travel as much. My dad is gone, my brother is gone. I wanted to do one last project.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harmon's memoir of life with his father and the lessons learned, called The Pro, was published in 2006, soon after his brother died.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This “last project” is a four-hour DVD lesson package, to be released March 1: Butch Harmon About Golf. Fred Couples, Ernie Els, Greg Norman, Gulbis, Johnson, Mickelson, Scott and Nick Watney sat down with Harmon for 1-on-1 chats during an entertaining segment called From Good to Great. Woods speaks to the camera about Harmon, calling him a “great motivator,” and says he encouraged players to develop their “playing feels.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harmon has been to 63 Masters. He was 5 when he first went, the year his father won. “My mother had me on a leash because I was running all over,” he recalls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harmon, a Vietnam veteran who served for three years, has seen it all in golf. He's watched all the great players of the past 100 years, except for Walter Hagen and Bobby Jones. Arnold Palmer was his hero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I used to hitch my pants up like him,” Harmon says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If he's wearing the same pants now, he'd really have to hitch them up because of the 45 pounds he's lost since he made his legacy DVD.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I told Terry Jastrow [the producer] that I love what we did, but I'd like to redo it now that I've lost the weight,” Harmon says, laughing. “But that would cost half a million. We didn't do it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harmon's primary golf school is at the Rio Secco Golf Club in Las Vegas. He's helped design a teaching facility at the Floridian National Golf Club in Stuart, Fla., where his son Claude III is the lead instructor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harmon will again work the Open Championship this summer for Sky Sports as an analyst. He's a teacher and a keen observer. What about Mike Weir, who is scheduled to return to the PGA Tour next week at the <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span> Pebble Beach National Pro-Am?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Mike's a feisty guy,” Harmon says, comparing him to Corey Pavin. “He knew what he could do and what he couldn't do. In this day and age they're like the mongoose and the cobra. The mongoose will get you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Luke Donald [the No. 1-ranked player in the world and the leading money winner last year on both the PGA Tour and the European Tour] made a believer out of me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The subject of Woods's game comes up. Harmon had said earlier that Woods at his best was the best ever, because he had no weaknesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I like what Sean [Foley, his current coach] is doing with Tiger,” Harmon says. “He's helped him slow down his hips, which is something I also had to do.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harmon says Woods's putting is a problem now. “You watch him, and you see that he's taking more time,” Harmon noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He points out that Woods's body language on the green is of a golfer who isn't confident over the ball.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harmon was disappointed when Woods left him, but he knows departures go with the territory. One thing is certain: Harmon has stayed the course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm impressed that he's done it for as long as he has,” Foley said this week. “You can't let your identity get all wrapped up in what you're doing. Butch has always been good to me. He told me when I started working with Tiger to keep my head up and just keep doing what I'm doing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harmon's sense of humour has been an asset. According to Foley, he knows “every joke in the book. He's hilarious. That's one reason he's so good with players at majors, where they're uptight.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dinner proceeds. The time flies by, and it's time for dessert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harmon declines. He's not going to put those pounds on again. He looks at his phone. There's a text. It's from Mickelson's caddy, Jim [Bones] Mackay. Mickelson has shot 77 in the first round of the <span class="companylink">Farmers Insurance</span> Open in San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Did you see anything today?” Mackay is asking. Harmon's work is never done. He's trying to slow down, sure, but, as he says, he'll never stop teaching. He's a Harmon. Teaching is in his DNA.</p>

Or something. In the pilot he recovers a guitar stolen from John Fogerty, who appears and plays briefly. And he helps a teenager locate his father, a military pilot who vanished. The setting is the Florida Keys, which adds to the goofy, strung-out ambience. Sidekicks include a U.S. Marshal (Mercedes Masöhn) who hates but really loves him. It's that kind of show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Puppy Bowl VIII</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunday, Animal Planet, 6 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now as much an institution as, and often more memorable than, the other Bowl on Sunday, this is cuteness epitomized. What is it? A two-hour show consisting of puppies gamboling aimlessly on a fake football field, that's what. The show began as a jokingly feeble attempt to counterprogram against the Super Bowl, some years ago, but quickly became startlingly popular. Last year, more that nine million viewers in the U.S. caught it. That's only 10 per cent of the Super Bowl audience. But still huge for the channel. The commentary, which mocks all the hoopla about NFL football, is priceless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Super Bowl XLVI</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunday, NBC, CTV, 6 p.m. ET</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right, then – it's New York Giants vs. New England Patriots. Will Tom Brady win his fourth Super Bowl ring? It matters little to many people watching. The ritual of the long, long, game-day coverage, the socializing and the food matter more. What will be talked about later is Kelly Clarkson singing The Star-Spangled Banner with the Indianapolis Children's Choir and Madonna performing at halftime. The latter performing annoyingly, probably. “I have to say that over 25 years of performing, I've never worked so hard or been so scrupulous or detail-oriented,” she said the other day, saying the right things. And then there are the commercials and people in Canada complaining that they can't see the hot commercials. That's part of the ritual too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Voice</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunday, NBC, Global, 10 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NBC kicks off the second season of The Voice by giving it the plum, post-Super Bowl slot. The show, yet another singing competition, did surprisingly well last year and NBC wants it to be as big as American Idol. Here comes the next great warbler. And, you know, it really is all about the voice – the judge can't see who is singing! Viewers can see and indeed can also see what wacky outfit is worn by judge Christina Aguilera. Which is distracting. And if you are utterly unmoved by Super Bowl programs of any kind, take note that Downton Abbey (PBS, 9 p.m.) continues along merrily, with Mary – oh, swoon! – and Sir Richard going shopping for a new country estate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chong report makes a strong case for a Sheppard subway extension. The question, as ever, is how to pay for it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Gordon Chong points out in his 173-page report, Toronto Transit: Back on Track, planners have been talking about a Sheppard subway for at least three decades. A five-station Sheppard “stubway” opened in 2002 after five years of construction, but it dead-ended at Don Mills instead of going all the way to Scarborough city centre as first planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Chong, a former city councillor and vice-chair of the TTC, argues that it is time to finish the job. Toronto, he says, suffers from “an obvious and growing transit deficit.” Transit plans seem to change with every election, with a pattern of “review, delay, change in priorities, change in branding of plans, and stops put on past commitments – repeated over and over again.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be hard to find anyone to disagree with that. Toronto has dithered for decades as other major cities from Stockholm to Berlin have built comprehensive networks of mass transit. Mayor Rob Ford is right to think big about transit and Sheppard is an obvious place to start expanding. But can the city really afford it? Here, the doubts creep in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only a few weeks ago, Dr. Chong was saying that the private sector could be expected to pay at most 30 per cent of the cost of building Sheppard, leaving taxpayers to cover the rest. Now he is saying the private sector could pay up to 60 per cent. More troubling, he says he came to this conclusion only in the past week after speaking to a highly placed friend at a financial institution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It just evolved in the last week,” he told reporters on Thursday. “I'm extremely optimistic … it's a go.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using an estimate from Metrolinx, the provincial transit agency, he says the city could take the Sheppard line from Downsview in the west to Scarborough city centre in the east for $3.7-billion. That is $1-billion less than the TTC's estimate. If it's correct, great. The provincial government has offered a maximum of $650-million for the Sheppard line, and only if there is money left over from the Eglinton Crosstown project. That leaves the city with a huge funding gap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But transit projects gobble up cash like no other, and the TTC's estimates for building Sheppard have grown by leaps over the years, from $154-million per kilometre in 1986 to $351-million in 2011. Who is to say they will not leap again?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Chong's report says the city could draw on a host of revenue sources to build Sheppard, from road tolls and higher public parking fees to various development charges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But road tolls, however sensible, are the hemlock of city politics. Mr. Ford has rejected them over and over. It is hard to imagine a mayor who vowed to end the “war on the car” and killed the car-registration tax jacking up parking rates either, even if he should.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for development charges, the report assumes that bringing rapid transit to Scarborough will draw masses of condos and office buildings and that the city could tap that wealth to pay for the subway. But who is to say the astonishing Toronto condo boom will continue indefinitely or that we will see a development explosion in the low-rise expanses of Sheppard, even with a subway?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Chong's zeal to get things moving is admirable, and his report helps move the debate, but, as he freely concedes, the city needs to look closer at the money question before moving ahead on Sheppard on its own.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're actually paying more attention to football and not the Super Bowl commercials on Sunday, you'll be getting the best TV announcing crew of the 2011 NFL season.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bonus of <span class="companylink">NBC</span> coverage – no, not Bob Costas's hair colour – will be the team of Al Michaels and Cris Collinsworth calling the shots from the booth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two conference championship games on CBS and FOX on Jan. 21 might have been the worst-called major sporting events by network crews. Missed calls, no insight and a general haste to jam in network promos made the CBS team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms almost unwatchable/unlistenable. On FOX, Joe Buck and Troy Aikman were only marginally better. (When you yell, “Can't you see that?” at the TV more than five times a game, the network has a problem.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michaels is the Maserati of play-by-play guys. There's no creepy Buck/Aikman welcome-to-the-booth/boys-in-the-tree-house feel when the veteran calls a game. He modulates, knows when to get excited and when to shut up. If you play a favourite sports moment back in your head, it's probably Michaels's voice you hear, whether he called the game or not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collinsworth can get a little verbose, but, as opposed to Aikman or Simms, his patois seems real and his homework is generally impeccable. He passes the test as the “guy you'd like to have a beer with and watch the game.” Granted, <span class="companylink">NBC</span> only had Sunday nights to call this NFL season, unopposed by other games, but they were the unquestioned leaders in the field.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, <span class="companylink">NBC</span> has the best sideline reporter in Michele Tafoya, a terrific studio host in Dan Patrick, a capable analyst in former New England Patriots safety Rodney Harrison … and we're looking for something nice to say about analyst/former coach Tony Dungy, but words fail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SELL SELL SELL</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's too bad AMC's Mad Men, about 1960s Madison Avenue, won't get the chance to tackle the Super Bowl file. The marketing opportunities of the title game only gained traction in the 1970s, rising to the fever pitch the NFL now enjoys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The event began in 1967 as a football game, but that was too simple a brief for the marketing men like Don Draper. Now, the game is subsumed by a marketing monolith where commercials and promotion are the headline performers. The Patriots and New York Giants this weekend will be a warm-up act for massive product branding. (Look out below, Naomi Klein.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using satellite radio, one could follow the blunt marketing behemoth as it marched its spokesmen through a production line of programs and networks this week. Story angles were shoved aside in place of former football worthies thinly disguised as hucksters for a branded product looking to use the Super Bowl as a springboard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ESPN, the mighty American all-sports cable channel, didn't even bother to disguise the product placement, running players such as Brett Keisel, a spokesman for Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo, through every one of its programs in sequence through the day. (ESPN folk call this the “car wash.”)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so it goes with America's biggest shill-fest. It's the pigskin version of Las Vegas, as brands are leveraged to the hilt in a virtual supermarket. Even 50-ish singer Madonna, former iconoclast, goes corporate this weekend as she performs at halftime. (Most NFL owners are in their 80s and 90s, so Madonna is probably a hip young thing by their standard.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RETRO MADNESS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What helped to turn this corporate tide was the advent of the Super Bowl commercial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mad Men-like efforts of the past are now as fondly remembered as touchdown throws and missed field goals in Super Bowl lore. Perhaps the Olduvai Gorge moment featured Steelers defensive tackle Mean Joe Greene in 1980, shilling for <span class="companylink">Coca-Cola</span>, tossing his soiled jersey to a tow-headed waif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because anything worth doing in commercials is worth ruining, Mean Joe is back this year, flogging for Downy fabric softener with comedian Amy Sedaris in a piece so brazen you have to admire its chutzpah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already this week, we've had other lengthy glimpses of commercials that will run Sunday. Both the Honda and Acura commercials are, like the Mean Joe spot, retro efforts as actor Matthew Broderick pillages his Ferris Bueller's Day Off legacy while comedian Jerry Seinfeld rummages up his “Soup Nazi” past to move a few cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There will be plenty more, many of which Canadians, in another Super Bowl tradition, will not see, as host broadcaster CTV inserts its own commercials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those living near a American-border city, you can watch the U.S. feed on bunny ears, but for the rest of us huddled north of the frontier, it will be Internet peeks or waiting till Monday to see what the shilling fun was about.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than a decade now, B.C.'s teachers' union has been controlled by an internal political party that has backed a string of presidents pushing an often confrontational and obstructionist agenda.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most public-sector unions in the province have been able to conclude a series of contract negotiations with the government over that period, the B.C. Teachers' Federation has been able to finish only one. Instead it has become de rigueur for the BCTF to commence job action and for the government to legislate teachers back to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, this hasn't entirely been the fault of the union. The Liberal government deserves some of the blame too. Unquestionably, it has let the BCTF's blatant support of the New Democratic Party affect its mood at the bargaining table. Invariably, those hurt most by the union's intransigence and the government's obduracy are the students each side insists are at the heart of their concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past four years, Rick Guenther has been a member of the BCTF executive. He has sat on the executive as an independent and not a member of the Coalition, the union's internal political party that took over the levers of power in 1999 and hasn't looked back. Unfortunately, the years that have followed have been mostly tumultuous ones in the world of K-12 education and the teachers' often militant union has played a leading role in making sure that's been the case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Guenther has seen enough. Recently, he announced that he will challenge current president Susan Lambert at the party's annual meeting in March. Many inside the union were shocked. The presidents are elected to one-year terms. Since 1999, those seeking re-election have mostly been acclaimed. The last time a president was taken on was five years ago, from the floor of a convention. Not surprisingly, that test went nowhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Guenther faces long odds himself. Local union presidents around the province play the biggest role in determining the faces of the 700 or so voting delegates who will be at the convention. Many of those presidents are either full-patch Coalition members or are supporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If he has any hope of upsetting the incumbent, Mr. Guenther would have to convince many of those presidents that it's time the union headed in a different direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If those presidents are smart, they will at least give the challenger a hearing, because what he's saying is some of the clearest thinking that has come from a union representative in some time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Mr. Guenther agreed that the BCTF would have a much better chance of finding common ground with the provincial government if it dialled back the overheated rhetoric that has undermined negotiations for a decade now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think we should be looking for opportunities to talk to the government and try to develop a bit of an understanding of their position,” Mr. Guenther said. “I think if we did that it might restrain us from taking some of the positions that we have that have not helped us at all. I don't think that's being a moderate. I think that's just being pragmatic.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He went on: “It can't do any harm. If at the end of it all you agree to disagree, that's okay too. There are times when you need to take a stand and fight, and there are times when it's more appropriate to engage in conversation in a forthright and respectful way.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's absolutely right, of course. But unfortunately, Mr. Guenther's position will be viewed as heresy inside the BCTF. It will be spun as the first step toward appeasement; that if Mr. Guenther takes over, the government will take advantage of his temperate approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the public supports B.C. teachers and the job they do but has little time for the antics of their union. The union has virtually no relationship with many of the key stakeholder groups in the education community – the government, trustees, principals and vice-principals and parent advisory councils among others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, much-needed education reform has been non-existent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Guenther said power has been concentrated inside the union for too long. “And I think that always presents the danger of developing an arrogance and complacency that is not in the union's best interest and, more importantly, not in the best interests of its membership.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Guenther's candidacy holds the promise of a new, positive era at the BCTF and everything that could flow from it. It will be up to union delegates to decide whether his more enlightened, moderate approach is just too radical a concept to back.</p>

As Mark MacKinnon revealed in The Globe and Mail this week, it seems likely that Prime Minister Stephen Harper's trip to China will be sealed with the Chinese government's loan of two pandas to the Toronto Zoo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As every panda trader knows, you can't go into these negotiations with an empty sack. You've got to bring some shiny beads of your own. So, on this trip, the Prime Minister is expected to talk about both the oil and sealing industries. It's not a bad deal: Oil (may cause stains to clothing and international reputations) and seal parts (various) for two adorable, crowd-pulling, bottom-scratching, slightly strange mammals. The Edinburgh Zoo, which, like its counterpart in Toronto, had an aging infrastructure and was facing hard decisions about its future, has seen a 200-per-cent rise in attendance since Yang Guang and Tian Tian arrived in their specially designed crates in December. That arrival was breathlessly tracked by British television networks. Also, there's the revenue from the zoo's gift shop: The living rooms of the nation are now littered with panda tchotchkes of unimaginable variety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this does not come without a cost, of course. The loan of the pandas to the Edinburgh Zoo was finalized on the same day as a $4-billion trade agreement between Britain and China, the centrepiece of which was an investment deal between one of Scotland's largest refineries and a Chinese petrochemical company. Sound familiar? It's called panda diplomacy, but it might be time to change the name to bear-knuckle haggling. Animal-rights activists squawked and, more important, so did campaigners for human rights in China, but their voices were drowned out by the sound of a lot of people slapping each other on the back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bears bring other costs: The Edinburgh Zoo is paying an estimated $1-million each year to China, plus some $100,000 a year to feed them (which seems like an awful lot, but there probably aren't a lot of all-you-can-eat bamboo buffets in that part of Scotland). There was also an enclosure to be adapted for the creatures, who prefer to live, like an ursine Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter, in separate but adjoining spaces. These are all things the Toronto Zoo will have to consider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his recent book The Way of the Panda, science writer Henry Nicholls describes the heartening efforts to conserve wild pandas, and also the Machiavellian ways the bear has been used as a political tool. Because they're so popular as a zoo attraction, they immediately confer a kind of glamour on whichever politician manages to snag 'em and drag 'em home. Richard Nixon was the first to benefit from a panda bump when the U.S. was given a pair as a gift after his historic visit to China in 1972. “It's going to be a hell of a story,” he said, but it was bigger than he could imagine (although, unfortunately for him, not bigger than Watergate). There were traffic jams outside Washington's National Zoo when the animals went on show. Taiwan finally accepted a pair of pandas from China in 2008, but not everyone was happy that they were called “Reunion.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pierre Trudeau, no fool, tried to snare some pandas on a trip to China in the early 1970s in return for a handful of beavers, but, alas, Canadian beaver just wasn't enticing enough. Or maybe Canada brought the wrong shiny beads to the table. This time, if and when the pandas are put in their crates bound for Toronto, someone should examine them, with care, and see whether they come with any strings attached.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Combining immediate heartbreak with the promise of more to come, it was a 24-hour span that said all too much about the economic decline of the country's largest province.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dire outlook came first with the Conference Board of Canada predicting on Thursday that Ontario should expect no better than 1.9 per cent annual economic growth. On Friday morning came the jobs figures from Statistics Canada, which showed an uptick in an unemployment rate that remains above the national average. But it was the developments in London, around the same time, that resonated more than the raw numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the start of the day, several hundred Londoners were locked out of their jobs making diesel trains for <span class="companylink">Caterpillar Inc</span>. By noon, they were simply out of work – the U.S.-based company responded to its ongoing labour dispute by pulling up stakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For this to happen in London, among the most hard-hit of Canadian cities in recent years, could hardly have been crueller. Nor could a single event have more strongly epitomized the reasons for the wrenching cost-cutting exercise that the province's government is about to go through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Feb. 15, economist Don Drummond will release his long-awaited report on public service reform, expected to help guide that austerity exercise. His recommendations will be more sweeping and draconian than the government expected when it commissioned him last spring. That's because he sees the Ontario's economic growth prospects much the same as the Conference Board does, largely owing to the decline of the manufacturing sector. That decline involves not just job losses, Mr. Drummond noted in an interview last month, but also a push toward lower wages. The events in London, where workers were laid off because they were unwilling to accept 50 per cent pay cuts, rather neatly encapsulated both of those phenomena.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> is known for its hardball tactics, so not every case will be as extreme. But the reality is that much of Ontario, outside the Greater Toronto Area and a few other hubs, is starting to look a lot like rust-belt states south of the border – places like Indiana, where it's rumoured those Cater-pillar jobs will be going, to people willing to work for less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As provincial officials rightly point out, growth projections five or 10 years down the road are hardly reliable, so the specific numbers being put out by Mr. Drummond or the Conference Board need to be taken with a grain of salt. But take into account the province's aging population, its declining share of skilled immigrants and other pressures, and the pessimism is more than understandable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's something the province's political leadership is unlikely to accept openly. In power for more than eight years, Dalton McGuinty is reluctant to tell Ontarians their prospects have significantly dimmed on his watch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Truth be told, it's pretty facile to blame a single premier for Ontario's struggles, which have more to do with the province's relative lack of natural resources and its traditionally close economic ties to the United States. And Mr. McGuinty has done at least some of the things experts have been calling on him to do – investing in education to create more of a knowledge economy; cutting business taxes; harmonizing sales taxes; going out on a limb with a green-energy jobs strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet for now, at least, the bad news keeps coming. And neither Mr. McGuinty nor his main political opponents, who recently ran for election on the simple premise that the path to prosperity is working hard and playing by the rules, seem to know what to do about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The old model is broken,” says Peter Harder, who like Mr. Drummond is a former senior federal bureaucrat well-versed in the province's troubles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The politicians ought to know that, on the evidence available. But there's no consensus how to address it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, Mr. McGuinty effectively acknowledged that he was at a loss over the budget crunch, and sought outside help in the form of Mr. Drummond. Now, Mr. Harder suggests, it might be time to launch another commission to address the root causes of those financial difficulties – the broader economic ones – if only to focus attention the way Mr. Drummond has.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What he didn't say, but is an alarming prospect, is that for the past year the province has been studying the wrong problem, or at least the less important one. After all, the depth of spending cuts Mr. Drummond will propose – or the alternative tax increases hinted at by the Conference Board – wouldn't be necessary if Ontario could figure out how to start growing again.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're the writer/director of a movie about the parallel lives of a sweet character and an imperious one, why not keep it simple and hire a sweet actress and an imperious one?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on back-to-back interviews in Toronto with her two rising stars, that's what Madonna did for W.E., her new drama about Wally, an unhappy wife (Abbie Cornish) who becomes entranced by the story of Wallis Simpson (Andrea Riseborough). And if reviewers haven't liked the film much (it opened in select cities yesterday), her casting is beyond reproach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cornish, 29, is the sweet one. She bears an uncanny resemblance to a young Nicole Kidman, a fellow Australian, but she's dreamier, more fleshly and sensual. She speaks languidly, in a warm, throaty voice, and when she laughs it builds slowly, eventually taking both me and the other journalist in our joint interview. Cornish has worked steadily, floating seamlessly from modelling to Australian TV to films (Candy, Bright Star, Limitless) and she has at least one movie-star ex, her Stop-Loss co-star Ryan Phillippe. Her attitude, though, is one of gentle wonder. When she says, “Growing up in a valley on a 170-acre farm, I used to dream, kind of stare up at the sky and wonder what's out there,” it's easy to picture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Riseborough, 30, is the imperious one. Excellent as Mrs. Simpson, she pretty much terrorizes her interlocutors. Petite and pale, she has the dark hair and red lips of Snow White, coupled with the thrilling frostiness of an evil queen. Her intelligence is evident, her diction absolute. Raised near Newcastle, England, she trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and the National Youth Theatre. She played Margaret Thatcher in a TV movie, had succulent parts in Made in Dagenham and Never Let Me Go, and held her own opposite Helen Mirren in Brighton Rock. Lately, she's been making the awards-show rounds at Madonna's side. (I don't know why Cornish isn't with them. I hope Riseborough didn't eat her.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, our first two questions fail to impress her, and the conversation turns tense and icy, never to recover. I still haven't recovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I'm going to print some questions and responses, and let you take a wild guess who's talking. (There's an answer key at the end.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. What was Madonna like as a director? “She always said, ‘I'm here if you need anything from me,' but she gave us a sense of freedom in regards to embodying the characters. When it came to shooting, she's a very visual, detailed director. She loves blocking things out. She was specific with the way she wanted everything – the furniture in the room, how I should walk from here to there, and then look over there. Before I walked on-set, she would choose my shoes and jewellery. It was her little ritual.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Based on Madonna's reputation, did she surprise you in any way? “I don't know what most people would think. I can't answer the question.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Did you do a lot of research? “No, I just winged it. Yes, of course. There is no sound bite not listened to, no visual clip or still not looked at, and it was the same for Madonna. Those things are an historical truth, and they serve you. But when you create a character, you have to trust they're in your DNA, unzip the suit that you've acquired and leave yourself raw to the possibility of anything that might happen.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Did any particular piece of research stand out? “I was fascinated by this detail in a documentary about Edward. Later in life, when he and Wallis were living together, he would wait at the bottom of the stairs while she was dressing. After a certain amount of time, the butler would bring him a chair, and he would sit and wait. In a little more time, the butler would bring him a cigarette, and he'd sit there and smoke and wait. He'd wait and wait. Sometimes she would come down and they would leave. And sometimes he'd wait so long that he would end up in tears. I'm not sure why, but there's something about that story that hit me in my heart.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. Was it … “You're going to ask if it was fun to wear the clothes. There are five questions that everybody asks. You must know that. You must have already figured that out.” (Note: I wish I'd had the composure to ask what the five are. It would have made my job so much easier for evermore. But I was rattled.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. Okay, did the wardrobe help you to find the character? “No. Sorry, I'm playing with you now. But, of course. Ask me something I can say more than yes or no to, because I want to give you my best, I really do.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">7. What elements must a project have to make you say yes to it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A) “The work has to inspire me. I have to want to invest in that character or world. It all comes from somewhere within you and is channelled through you.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B) “I'm horribly picky. I'm looking for the best thing out there. Full stop. I want to be fulfilled; I want to explore; I want to be enlightened. Long order. I want to learn and experience, and feel the rhythm of somebody else's soul. I say no to things all the time. All the time. I've no interest in being involved in things that don't fulfill me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8. When did you know you wanted to act?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A) “I don't know. I do remember the moment I decided to go to RADA – I was shredding a duck at a Chinese restaurant. But I'd had this love affair with an amazing guy called William Shakespeare since the age of 9. And before that, with black-and-white movies on the BBC at 2:30 in the afternoon. Even when I was very little, like 3, I responded to them. Everything from Bogart to Bergman, Tarkovsky and Cassavetes. And I had a feverish want to create. I would get unbearably excited about painting a picture all day, or writing a book at age 6.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B) “I wanted to be a musician or a vet, or travel. I loved painting; my mum's a painter. Then, my first audition, I got the role, and my first day, I couldn't believe how fun it was. I called my mum and said, ‘Mum, I'm having the time of my life. Do you think I could do more of this?' She said, ‘You can do whatever you want.'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Answers: Riseborough: 1, 4, 7A, 8B; Cornish: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7B, 8A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. Sorry, I'm playing with you now. I must admit that it's kind of infectious. Of course, it's the other way around.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governments across Canada are anxiously watching the City of Toronto's negotiations with two locals of the Canadian Union of Public Employees – unresolved as of press time – as a test of the ability of all levels of government to restrain and reduce public-sector spending, and to restore the public finances of Canada to good health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On midnight between Saturday and Sunday. CUPE Local 416 – Toronto's “outside” workers, among others, garbage collectors and road maintenance staff – will be in a legal position to strike, and Mayor Rob Ford's administration will be in a position to lock them out. Negotiations with the “inside” workers, members of Local 79, and with Local 2998 (“front-line” workers in community centres) have not reached this stage.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CUPE 416 stands for the status quo. It is not asking for any wage increase over the next three years, but it is resisting management's ability to manage, which is severely constrained by the existing collective agreement. It is – or should be – the function of a government to direct and deploy its employees as it sees fit, economically and efficiently. Oddly enough, it is the city government that is proposing raises over the next three years, in the form of a series of three lump-sum payments, followed by a wage increase starting on New Year's Day, 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Ferguson, the president of 416, has said that his members' seniority rights under the collective agreement are “actually very common. Most of CUPE's municipal bargaining units across Canada contain similar protections.” That is all the more reason why this labour dispute is not merely a local matter, but also one that is nationally resonant – though Doug Holyday, the Deputy Mayor, has said that Toronto suffers “from some of the most restrictive and inefficient terms and conditions in the country.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the union is defending the status quo, it has no motive to go on strike; the outside workers can win their point by continuing business as usual. If the negotiations do not succeed, Mr. Ford, Mr. Holyday and Joe Pennachetti, the city manager, may be left in the invidious position of locking out the workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CUPE apparently prefers seniority rights and control of shift schedules to money. This is not so much a “gravy train” – a favourite metaphor of Mr. Ford's – as willful traffic congestion. Let governments, not unions, route the train.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relax, Canada. Do not be concerned that J. MONTGOMERY CAN has not flashed across scoreboards at any skeleton tracks this season.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was conspicuously absent from the men's World Cup skeleton event at the Whistler Sliding Centre on Friday, but we have not seen the last of Jon Montgomery. There are plenty of runs in his future, and possibly another gold medal, in Sochi. Why not? He will return to the sport on his own terms and with better equipment. True, he will by his estimate be, maybe, six figures lighter in the chequebook, but Montgomery believes it will be worth it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beats getting your butt handed to you every race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Montgomery followed up his gold-medal win at the Vancouver Olympics with a ninth-place finish in the 2010-11 season, his only podium position a first-place finish in the first race of the season, in Whistler. On the day of the final selection race for the Canadian team this season, Montgomery started wondering about possibly eschewing the European portion of the schedule, or maybe sliding instead on some different tracks in the Intercontinental Cup. At that point, he says, another thought “started to form in my head.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why not take the entire season off?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Knowing his equipment was no match for the stuff being churned out by the multimillion-dollar German FES program, Montgomery remembered a discussion with folks from Calgary-based manufacturing firm Standen's, which develops and manufactures steel suspension components, trailer axles and agricultural tillage tools, during a breakfast at an auto auction (Montgomery, remember, is an auctioneer). Standen's helped Montgomery with the sled that won the gold medal. Were their engineers up for a bigger challenge, he wondered? Such as helping him develop and design a sled from the ground up? Turns out the answer was yes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think the writing on the wall was actually last year, the second day of training in Calgary, when I just thought: ‘You have zero chance,'” Montgomery said in a telephone interview from his Calgary home on Thursday as he settled down in front of a computer to watch Mellisa Hollingsworth win the women's World Cup skeleton race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Montgomery, who is married to skeleton pilot and would-be Olympian Darla Deschamps, has taken a hands-on role in terms of ideas and concepts and saddle fitting. The idea is to come up with a sled that can be tuned up for different tracks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a bit like <span class="companylink">NASCAR</span>, where you need different setups for different tracks,” Montgomery explained. “I'm trying to create a sled that is at least somewhat tuneable for each track.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Montgomery's zeal for racing remains. His workout regimen consists on some days of “racing the dog in a race down the street,” but he isn't, in his words, “about to let myself go.” He has purchased a Bromley sled in addition to Version 1 of his work-in-progress sled, and says the run volume he's getting in Calgary in one day is equal to what he'd get on tour in a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Montgomery and Hollingsworth were in Toronto in November doing a round of media appearances after Bobsleigh Skeleton Canada's 20-year sponsorship arrangement with Visa Canada was not renewed. “I'd made my decision before that trip to Toronto,” Montgomery said. “But I didn't think it would be right to say anything about it. I didn't want it to be about me or my decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I believe we're a saleable group of athletes,” he added. “I think somebody will step up. I don't think it will go down to the final hour.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Montgomery, right now it's that final hundredth of a second that is the greater concern, as opposed to the final hour. “This is my new competitive outlet, building something better than what I had before,” he said. Considering the odds of a flat-lander from Russell, Man., conquering an Olympic mountain, it might not be wise to bet against him.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, did you have the over on Sunday? Did you take the <span class="companylink">New York Giants</span> and the points? What action did you have on New York receiver Victor Cruz? Super Bowl XLVI was to gambling what Simon Cowell is to bad singing. A TV magnet. An irresistible draw to millions of North American viewers to lose any semblance of human dignity in the pursuit of riches and fame.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not enough for Usual Suspects to fret over touchdowns and field goals. We're made of sterner stuff. To us, Super Bowl meant playing the odds on the stage directions of the big game. Madonna. Kelly Clarkson. Lea Michele. Yes, betting on the production values of the NBC game telecast via the proposition bets available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could the mere mention of No. 1 draft prospect Andrew Luck of Stanford by Bob Costas of NBC make us rich! (It didn't.) We started simply enough, taking the possible record American TV audience for the game. With teams from two of the top five local TV markets in the U.S. playing, the over/under number offered was a record 117 million homes. We won't know till Monday, but assuming the game would stay close, we liked the over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We finally achieved traction with Kelly Clarkson's national anthem. Would she show off her belly (+300)? Would she wear a Super Bowl/NFL shirt (+300), Indianapolis Colts jersey (+500), New England Patriots jersey (+700), Giants jersey (+1,500), anything else (-300)? How long would she take to sing The Star-Spangled Banner (over/under 1:34)? Would she go all Christina Aguilera and muff the words (Yes +225)? How long would the Texas native hold the word “brave” at the end (over five seconds -110, five seconds 130).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To prepare, we scouted Clarkson's anthem chops on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> from appearances at Game 3 of the 2010 American League playoffs and the NBA final in Dallas. Both times came in at 1:33. “O say can you see …” the under? Likewise, Kelly's a pro, not prone to draw blanks on “the rockets' red glare” so we passed on the Aguilera factor. We did jump the under-five seconds on the word “brave.” Because it's the anthem, we thought Kelly would opt for a conservative wardrobe, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How did it go? If you had no tummy, no Aguilera moment, “the brave” at under five seconds, you're a winner. The entire thing at 1:34 was a push (tie). Like Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers on the pregame show, Clarkson did a great job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Madonna was the halftime fare (after referring to herself in the third person with Bob Costas). How would she accessorize? Blonde (-250)? Yup. Another hair colour (+250)? Nope. Would she start the show using a headset (-300) or hand-held microphone (+200)? Headset, folks. The Material Mom stumbled around and looked lame, but there was no prop for that. We wished there was a prop on whether she'd flown in on Virgin Airways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How many times would Tom Brady's wife Giselle Bundchen appear on camera? (First sighting, six minutes into the first quarter.) Would their son be wearing a Brady No. 12 Patriots jersey? No sign by halftime. This being Indiana, would homeboys Larry Bird, David Letterman or Bobby Knight make live appearances (yes: -120; no: -120)? Again, no signs by the half. Betting on production cues is a funny way to make a living on Super Bowl Sunday. But if you took a run at the unders on TV props, you probably had a good night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proud as peacock</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NBC leveraged its coverage across every one of its platforms. Every NBC sitcom was represented against the Super Bowl logo. David Feherty's Golfchannel show was live in Indy. Alec Baldwin of 30 Rock hosted the NFL Awards. The judges from The Voice broke out their cliches, and every NBC face monkey took a turn in a faux-musical number called The Brotherhood of Man. All worth it, however, to hear Tina Fey say, “Is a Clydesdale going to kick a beer at Betty White or something?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tweet surrender</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twitter was made for Superbowl. Of the thousands out there, here are our favourites:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• @Kenny_Mayne: “This whole thing is as big or bigger than the Grey Cup.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• @darrenrovell 36 per cent of kids under 25 said they'd prefer to be “hooking up” instead of watching SB.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• AlbertBrooks: “Jews don't celebrate the Super Bowl so we'll be going to Chinese restaurants.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• @SteveMartinToGo: “Since coin toss ceremony is such a highlight, why not hold it after the game to hang onto viewers?”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to the office, studio and temporary fundraising centre of CICV, a community station found at 98.7 FM on the dial. They call themselves The Lake. “We're lake-oriented up here,” said Michael Bishop, chair of the station's elected board of directors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can find the station in a white, two-storey building surrounded by a picket fence at 37 Wellington Rd. West in Lake Cowichan, “one block from the United Church,” the station website helpfully explains, “on a plot of land where the E&amp;N railroad used to run.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building is a former forest rangers station. With a gambrel roof, it looks like an old barn. The antenna outside stands just 14 metres tall. On a good day, it sends the signal as far afield as Mesachie Lake, about six kilometres to the west. It does not always get as far as Honeymoon Bay, another four kilometres down the road, or across the lake to Youbou, both of which are in the shadow of Bald Mountain, a peak on a peninsula that juts into the lake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The staff suggests attaching old-fashioned rabbit ears to a home radio to improve reception.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five watts – count 'em, five – only gives you so much juice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even that pipsqueak voice is under threat. The station approaches a deadline in August by which time its temporary broadcast licence – a learner's permit is how Mr. Bishop describes it – will expire. They need to raise at least $5,000, and perhaps as much as $15,000, to complete an engineering study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We only have two little things to overcome,” Mr. Bishop said. “Time and money.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cash is a heady sum for the station, which depends on volunteers and whose greatest asset is the goodwill of a listening audience whose numbers they cannot even afford to count.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If they raise the money and succeed in hiring an engineering firm to complete a technical report for the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, the station intends to apply for a 50-watt licence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're hoping to get it done on the cheap,” Mr. Bishop said. “We're in a small community and we want to stay here.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If they fail, then such shows as The Psychedelicatessen (Randy Liboiron's pick of weird music from 1960 to '75) and Grandma Grace Storytime (during which Grace Bond reads children's stories) will fall silent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The station first hit the airwaves two years ago with items like a fisherman's report highlighting cutthroat hot spots on Cowichan Lake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current schedule features lots of music – none of it appearing on the current Billboard 100, as dictated by the station's licence – and old-time radio dramas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the programming is like leaning over the back fence to chat with the neighbours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The station airs 13 local programs, beginning the broadcast week sharply at 9 a.m. Sunday with Animal Health Care, a husbandry show hosted by the aptly named Elaine Nurse. This is followed in the afternoon by Gary's Gospel Mix with Gary Dyck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday and Thursday, local writer Catherine Dook presents Dock Diaries, featuring anecdotes about misadventures as a houseboat habitué. Mr. Bishop hosts his own show, too, called, not surprisingly, Open Mike, featuring a mix of “news, views and interviews.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The airwaves are open to just about anyone with a willingness to don headphones and speak into the ether. Just the other day, Lindsey Hartshorn, the local high-school drama teacher, presented a radio drama written and performed by her pupils.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The station regulars now hope some of the teens might develop a regular show of their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The station currently reaches about 5,000 residents, a population that grows in summer, when city dwellers flee the Capital District and the Lower Mainland to enjoy the lake's icy waters. Even so, Mr. Bishop estimates the listening audience numbers in the three figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, The Lake can be heard streaming on the Internet at cicv.streamon.fm, thanks to the sponsorship of a Victoria company that offers hyperbaric treatments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SOS (Save Our Station) campaign is off to a slow start, but the volunteers are hopeful, especially since Island Savings and Credit Union is accepting donations at any branch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The station takes its responsibilities Foreign Minister says. They want to stay on the air at least to be able to provide information should the area face a disaster, such as an earthquake or forest fire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a good day, the staff even dream about some day moving the antenna from the shadow of Bald Mountain to its peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just one thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't drop your coins in the glass jar near the microphone when the red light is on.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Prime Minister Stephen Harper visits China this week, many Canadians will be wondering how he will deal with the human-rights dimension of the Canada-China relationship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent Asia Pacific Foundation survey of Canadians professionally engaged with Asia found that 72 per cent perceive China's human-rights record to be “poor.” Many also view Canada's record of action on human rights in the region to be ineffective, with 62 per cent believing that no real difference was made. Many Canadians believe that serious human-rights problems persist in China and that we need to engage, yet feel uncertain about how to proceed.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's performance of international human-rights standards has been conflicted. Beijing has incorporated many of these standards into its constitution and domestic legal system. Yet, persistent and credible reporting on violations continue, particularly in the repression of political dissent, harassment of lawyers and human-rights advocates, and suppression of religion and ethnic minority cultures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are also good news stories on human rights in China. Its recent Human Rights Action Plan commits the government to improving a broad array of human-rights conditions, ranging from economic and social development to political participation. Targeted government policies in health care, poverty alleviation, education and labour relations suggest a broad commitment to improving people's daily lives. And revisions to China's tax system reflect the government's efforts to redress human-rights issues of income disparity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many other countries, China has found that human-rights protection is not a matter of abstract ideals but rather an essential dimension of economic and social development. Canada's relations with China should proceed from an appreciation of these complexities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mindful of the contradictions in China's human-rights performance, our engagement with Beijing should appreciate that human-rights issues are inseparable from economic and trade relations. Recalling that human rights include social, economic and cultural rights as well as political and civil rights, we should acknowledge that economic relations and human rights are mutually supportive dimensions of our mature relationship with China. Human-rights standards on labour relations, health care and sustainable development, for example, have a direct impact on productivity and hence on economic and trade ties. Similarly, trade standards on transparency and the rule of law support not only trade relations but more open and inclusive civil and political relationships generally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada should emphasize the importance of China's performance of its domestic and international legal obligations that support both human rights and trade. Mindful that a government that sidesteps its own laws in attacking lawyers and writers who stray from official orthodoxy may also be tempted to ignore local and international legal standards on trade, we should continue to emphasize legal compliance. This is not about preaching “Western values” but about encouraging compliance with China's own laws and international obligations. Canada can constructively encourage Chinese leaders to promote compliance with China's domestic laws and international commitments that require human-rights protection while also supporting economic and trade relations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, there are human-rights issues such as political expression and religious freedom where sensitivities may inhibit free discussion. But it would not be unreasonable to suggest that more open debates about governance can work not only to satisfy civil and political rights standards but also promote better policy-making, while more openness on issues of religious belief and practice can support stated goals of social harmony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building a mature relationship with China is in Canada's interest. Such a relationship depends on China's compliance with its own laws and treaty commitments that promote economic and trade co-operation together with human-rights protection. The Prime Minister should encourage an integrated approach to trade and human rights to further human-rights protection while also promoting economic and trade relations.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A warmer-than-usual winter has been bad news for ski bums, but great for cyclists who have so far seen little reason to hang up their wheels. Still, even snow-deficient conditions don't negate the need to winterize. Some easy to execute instructions below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reinvent your wheels</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot of people assume knobby mountain bike tires are best for slushy conditions, when in fact the opposite is true. Jon Carroll, a bike mechanic at The Bike Joint in Toronto, says that slick tires are always best for city riding, particularly in winter, when they cut through slush or snow rather than riding on top of it. Plus, the lack of grooves means they won't get clogged up with salt and gravel, which can diminish life span.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If your wheels are best suited to off-roading, Mr. Carroll recommends a swap, and a second set of city wheels is a relatively cost-effective investment. You should also be equipped with front and rear fenders, to minimize slush spray soaking your duds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Give yourself a brake</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When tires are wet, which is generally the case in winter, braking can take a few extra milliseconds, which might not seem like a lot, but anything that makes the ride safer is obviously worth your attention. Mr. Carroll suggests ensuring that your brake pads are not in need of replacing (most pads have a wear point that indicates it's time for a new set). This as well as all other upkeep-related issues should be addressed at your annual tune-up, a springtime tradition for any serious cyclist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be a rust buster</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chain is one of the most common casualties of winter riding, thanks to damp conditions and corrosive salt. Ensure that your bike's life-force stays well oiled and rust-free by applying cycle-specific winter lube once a week. And don't try to save a buck by using the WD40, because it's not the same thing. To protect the frame, get in the habit of wiping down your bike after every ride and if possible store it in a dry, indoor environment. If not, pick up a bike cover or let your summer barbecue cover pull double duty: “It's cheaper and just as good,” says Mr. Carroll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Use bright lights in the big city</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even an unseasonably warm winter doesn't protect riders from the early nightfall, which makes biking home from work significantly more perilous. Canadian law requires that all two-wheelers be equipped with a light on the back and on the front, but not all bulbs are created equal. Mr. Carroll advises bikers to invest in the brightest light possible (this will set you back less than a case of beer). Lights on your helmet and reflective wardrobe options such as vests and leg bands are also a great way to make sure that your presence on the road does not go unnoticed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wasn't riding a bike just to ride a bike. I was doing it to enter the Church of the Wheel, where supplicants are a happy lot, if you believe the catechists.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The happiest cities all have a high number of cyclists, John Helliwell, a renowned happiness expert and economist at University of British Columbia, explained to me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denmark routinely tops the list of the happiest countries in the world. In Copenhagen, one in three people cycles to work or school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this country, a survey of more than 6,000 people found that 66 per cent of those who walk or bike to work say they're very happy with their commute. That compares to only 25 per cent of public transit users and 32 per cent of drivers, according to the Statistics Canada report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I just wish it didn't feel so suicidal. Cyclist fatalities may be relatively low in Toronto – averaging three per year – but there are 1,200 collisions, the highest percentage by population among major Canadian cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Let me know when you arrive safely,” my partner said as I set off in the morning. I waved goodbye as if I were headed for the Far North, not to pedal 10 blocks to the south.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I had ditched the stylish purse and heels. “Take my backpack,” suggested my son, who is visiting from Europe. I put on ugly, warm gloves. I squished a woollen hat on my head. I donned the dreaded puffy coat. He was impressed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I walked 15 minutes to the nearest Bixi kiosk, the bike-sharing enterprise in Toronto, launched last May. Bixi has 1,000 bikes at 80 stations in the downtown core. I opted for a 72-hour pass, $12 (there are four payment options), thinking I would commute back and forth to work for two days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's recycling on wheels,” said Dr. Helliwell. “You're doing something for … future generations.” The station is solar-powered. The Canadian company started in Montreal in 2009 and is now in Ottawa and London, England.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I felt as virtuous as a dieter who can resist chocolate cake; good and honest as Jack Layton. It would be just me, my legs and two tires among the throng, making my way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe I could be cool, too. I watched my soon-to-be biker comrades sweep into the station. They jumped off their ride effortlessly. Their bikes were like horses they hitched to a post. Off they strutted to their appointment; latter-day urban cowboys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I joined the asymmetrical flow of traffic. Other bikers swept past me. We exchanged looks at stop signs, a silent acknowledgment of our purpose and our plight. Cars were schoolyard bullies, and we were the innocents. I remained steady, as a car drove a little too close for comfort. I steered carefully around a stopped bus, wobbling only slightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was trying for a Mary Poppins effect. There is a woman I sometimes see in my neighbourhood, who rides her bike through the traffic down Yonge Street, seated upright in her saddle, her purse in the basket. Smiling and helmet-less, she is fearless and graceful as a swimmer doing a steady crawl through a choppy sea. l like what it suggests: that you're confident, oblivious to the chaos, trusting in others' goodwill and courtesy, at one with your bike. From the comfort of a car, it looks like an existential statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I had an ulterior motive. Maybe I could achieve a mental void into which a column would write itself. Imogen Heap, an eccentric British singer who wears odd clothes and feathers, ribbons and butterflies in her hair, told me once in an interview that she pedals her bike to and from her recording studio in London as a creative exercise. Lyrics come to her as well as snatches of music.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Penn told me the same thing. He's the author of It's All About the Bike: The Pursuit of Happiness on Two Wheels. Now 44, he gave up a law career in his 20s to ride around the world on a bike. He owns six bikes; his family of five owns one car. “What's important is the rhythm of riding a bike. That rhythm is happiness. It's meditative,” he told me on the phone from Wales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Within 10 minutes of being on a bike, things that are immediately worrying you – that piece of work you haven't finished – have been dismissed. Ride for 45 minutes and you hardly know what you were thinking about and then something else drops in – a line from a poem or something your child said.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a mild winter day, almost spring-like. I liked being on the level of the street, moving in a river of humanity, contained between the buildings, all of us together but each with a destination only he or she knew. That sounds kind of Zen, no?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was watching on an intimate level: the way one driver ignored me, the way another waved me on to go first. My bike was a perfect observational platform. I could stop when I wanted to. I could retreat to the safety of the sidewalk when the traffic was too treacherous. Maybe I shouldn't have, but I didn't care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And into my head came an image of the time when each of my three boys first wobbled off on his two-wheeler, unassisted. My hand is gently on his back, steadying him, as I run along beside him, then I pull the hand away. “Oh, there you go! You're doing it all on your own!” I shout after him. And he disappears around the corner, on his own journey, independent. It is what life asks of all of us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I arrived at the kiosk station nearest the office and docked my bike. I felt great. No need to go to the gym that day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That evening, I unlocked another Bixi and rode it uptown toward home. Alas, no mental void this time. I was actively telling myself why I should be enjoying the ride – the fresh air, the proximity to green spaces (Dr. Helliwell said that was a key to bike happiness), the stirring of blood after a long, sedentary day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was cold, and the traffic was heavy. Nevertheless, I was still feeling okay. I rewarded myself by stopping to meet my son and partner for a beer in the local pub. I was exhilarated. By riding a bike to and from the office, I felt I had reclaimed some personal time from work life. I had some control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next day, it all fell apart. I started off in the same way. I walked to my local Bixi and I swiped my credit card to get my unlocking code. It didn't work. I called the toll-free customer service. Wait 10 minutes, a woman explained. I did. I sent some e-mails on my BlackBerry. I tried to unlock a bike again. Still some problem. I looked at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that's when I did it. I hailed a cab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wasn't Zen. I had a deadline.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I told you Sun News was high comedy. Non-stop hilarity in the pseudo-news racket. Was I right? Now, I'm thinking musical. Or light opera. Everybody's doing it. There was a recent one-time performance of an opera about Toronto Mayor Rob Ford. There's Mulroney: The Opera.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The kookiness of Sun News is ideal material. In the “let's put on a show” tradition came let's create a loony news channel idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now is the time for the musical version. Agitated TV anchors dancing across the stage. (Krista Erickson already has the arm-ballet movements down.) Government ministers genuflecting at the altar of Ezra Levant. Bureaucrats playing real people in news bits. What larks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And everyone loves a musical. Perks us up. Singing and dancing is all over television right now. From American Idol and other singing competitions (The Voice takes up two hours of real estate on NBC and CTV tonight at 8 p.m.) to Glee. Little wonder. Sources of joy are needed and sought out in these hard times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smash (NBC, CTV, 10 p.m.) is the latest in a wave of shows about music. And, boy, is it big, broad and gloriously good. This is a drama about musicals, about grown-ups addicted to the thrill of the stage, the joy and abandon of a well-executed musical number.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pilot episode tonight is an extraordinarily graceful celebration of the American dream of stardom, and an ambitious and flagrantly approving story of the addiction to performance. It opens beautifully with a young woman singing Over the Rainbow. That's the opening nod to the rapture of the American musical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then comes the contrasting grim reality of auditions. We meet the producer character Julia (deftly done by Debra Messing) and, by the by, somebody says of Marilyn Monroe, “I think she'd make a great musical.” The reaction is “been there, done that” but a seed is sown. There's a singer, Karen (Katharine McPhee) who says, “I'm not sexy enough, I'm the girl next door.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stuff happens. There's another singer, Ivy (Megan Hilty), who is more experienced and more of a Marilyn type. Julia's husband says, “I hate the theatre, I really do.” There's the central tension – the addiction to show, to music, to joy, always clashing with the mundane world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over and over it happens, this clash. Karen's dad says, “Sometimes dreams just don't mix with reality.” But he's wasting his time. We see the hard grind of rehearsals but we are taken smoothly from rough rehearsal to imagined glory in the finished stage musical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are thrown into backstage machinations. Big-time producer Eileen (Anjelica Huston) is trying to prove herself away from her ex-husband in the midst of a bitter divorce. And along comes the nastiness and spite that is the other side of showbiz genius – that's all embodied in the magnetic character of Derek (Jack Davenport), the Brit director who is all cut-throat competitiveness and adept at creating power dynamics that suit him. A scene tonight between Derek and Karen is an exquisite exposition of all the viciousness that can accompany the elation of performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two young women are potential Marilyns. That's the hook in the drama that unfolds. The unknown willowy brunette Karen. The more experienced and skilled blonde Ivy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a showbiz hook, but the real attractiveness of Smash is its lyrical expression of the romanticism of the musical. This showbiz world is a garden of delights and simultaneously the gates of hell. And the thrill of performance transcends everything. (The series is created by playwright Theresa Rebeck and co-written by Rebeck and Scott Burkhardt.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smash is an ingenious drama, all charm and substance too. It's not Glee for grown-ups, as some reviews have suggested. It's better than that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ah, the kicks and pleasure of the musical. And please think about it – Sun News: The Musical is sure-fire entertainment. Hope the idea inspires somebody.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also airing tonight</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underground Railroad:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The William Still Story (PBS, 10 p.m.) is a fine and often chilling new doc about Sill, a Philadelphia clerk who was a key figure in the network of people who arranged for runaway slaves to travel to Canada. He spent 14 years helping the Underground Railroad and about 800 former slaves made it to Canada thanks to his work. Unlike others involved in the dangerous work, he kept secret notes and records that are now an invaluable portrait of just what happened, and why. Although the program is a documentary, it features Stratford actor Dion Johnstone as Still, speaking Sill's own words, and it's a powerful performance.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal between the city and its outside workers is a big win for Mayor Rob Ford at a time when he needs one badly. Last month, he faced a revolt over his budget cuts. This month, he is facing another over his transit plans. Things are getting so far off track that some critics were calling him a lame duck only 14 months into his four-year mandate.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now he appears to have wrung important concessions out of a major city union. What is more, he has done it without a work stoppage that had come to seem almost inevitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ford is famous across the country for vowing to “stop the gravy train” and cut waste at city hall. He has made it perfectly clear since coming to office in December of 2010 that he thinks city workers are part of the gravy, that the city has far too many of them and that he would be demanding more from everyone. Governments around Canada have been watching the dispute, expecting it to set a tone as they look for sacrifices from public-service unions in a time of deficits and austerity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The assumption since last fall is that the city would be locking out its workers to enforce a deal. City departments from garbage to city planning had been training managers to step into the shoes of unionized workers in the event of a work stoppage. The union, for its part, had been saying publicly until very recently that it believed the city was not bargaining seriously and that Mr. Ford simply wanted to make it the whipping boy in his cutback campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now this: a dramatic 12th-hour deal that came after an all-night bargaining marathon. Mr. Ford called it “fantastic” for taxpayers. “We do not have a strike and we're going to keep this city moving.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The irony is that a conservative mayor who rails against an overstuffed public service managed to get a deal that eluded his left-leaning, union-friendly predecessor. David Miller took a bitter 39-day strike from the same union in the summer of 2009. “Is it true the union could break Miller's heart, but they couldn't break yours?” one reporter asked Mr. Ford Sunday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2009 dispute helped lay the ground for this one. The strike drained public sympathy for the city unions, making it difficult for them to plausibly use the strike threat again. They have been saying for weeks that they had no intention of striking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city, for its part, reacted to the events of 2009 by moving to force matters to a head early. The city is most vulnerable in the summer, when a walkout by garbage workers would mean smelly garbage piling up in heavily used public parks. The deputy mayor, Doug Holyday, said that the city would not let the union employ delaying tactics to drag out the talks till the summer again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of locking the union out, the city said that unless a deal was struck, it would simply impose new working conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That put the union in a fix. Going to work on Monday morning under new, city-imposed conditions might have seemed like a tacit acceptance of them. Suddenly calling a strike in protest at the city's hard-ball tactics would have been equally tough for the union, given they had insisted they had no strike plans. Local 416 president Mark Ferguson called the city a “bully” for making the threat but stayed at the bargaining table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We don't yet know what that deal contains, but Mr. Ferguson said he had been forced to make “numerous” concessions. If so, and Mr. Ford has managed to secure big gains from a tough union rival without even an hour of strike or lockout, then it will be a significant victory indeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The timing could not be better. A posse of city councillors is coming after Mr. Ford over his costly insistence on putting most of the Eglinton Crosstown transit line underground. Even if he loses the looming fight over transit expansion, though, the core of Mr. Ford's message is the claim that he, and only he, can bring a businessman's discipline to city government. Taming the city's old-school unions was always part of that agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ford can now argue he has helped bring city hall down from cloud cuckoo land and closer to the world where most of us work. That can't fail to help him if he faces voters again in 2014.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, your muscles can no longer get enough oxygen. It's an immutable physical limit that kicks in during any sustained physical exercise and tells your body: “This fast – but no faster.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least, that's the theory we've been working with since 1923. But a controversial new study from researchers on three continents suggests that the famous “VO2max” – the maximum amount of oxygen that you're able to deliver to your muscles during hard exercise – isn't really a maximum at all. Your heart and lungs don't call the shots after all; your brain does.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept of VO2max was first introduced by Nobel Prize-winning physiologist A.V. Hill, who found that the amount of oxygen consumed by his muscles increased as he ran at a steadily increasing pace – up to a point. Eventually, his oxygen consumption would plateau, even if he continued to run faster and faster until he reached exhaustion. That plateau, he argued, represented his body's “maximal oxygen uptake,” or VO2max.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the decades since, VO2max has become a standard tool to assess aerobic fitness. Researchers measure it using an incremental test to exhaustion: On a treadmill or exercise bike, subjects start at an easy pace, and get faster every minute or so until they're unable to continue, having reached a plateau in oxygen consumption shortly before failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what causes this plateau? In the conventional view, there are three possibilities, according to Fernando Beltrami, a researcher at the University of Cape Town in South Africa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“One is that the heart can't pump any more blood,” he says. “The second is that the muscles are unable to extract any more oxygen from the blood. And the third is that the lungs can't extract any more oxygen from the air we breathe.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the decades, debate has raged among physiologists about the ultimate location of the bottleneck: heart, muscles or lungs? But the new theory, proposed by physiologist and author Tim Noakes (who is also Mr. Beltrami's university adviser), suggests that the limit may not be physical at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Dr. Noakes's “central governor” theory, your decision to slow down or stop during self-paced exercise isn't the result of an absolute physical limit. Instead, your brain applies the brakes proactively to prevent you from reaching these limits. After all, if you really did run to the absolute edge of your physical limits, Dr. Noakes is fond of pointing out, you'd be dead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month's issue of the British Journal of Sports Medicine contained eight different studies that, in various ways, offered support for Dr. Noakes's still-controversial views. The most significant was a study led by Mr. Beltrami, with collaborators in Norway, Britain and Australia, that turned the standard incremental VO2max test on its head and used a “decremental” test instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Beltrami's 26 volunteers started by performing a conventional incremental VO2max test. Then, on a separate day, half of them repeated the incremental test while the other half performed a decremental test. After a brief warm-up, the decremental test ramped immediately to a speed higher than the maximum speed reached in the previous incremental test. After about a minute – just before the subjects were about to fall off the back of the treadmill – the speed was decreased by one kilometre an hour. This process was repeated over and over, with the speed being lowered just before the subjects reached failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the group that did two incremental tests, VO2max scores remained the same; but in the decremental group, VO2max scores increased by an average of 4.4 per cent. In other words, the subjects were suddenly able to transport more oxygen to their muscles, simply because the test structure was altered – a clear indication that it wasn't a fundamental property of the heart, lungs or muscles that created the initial plateau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers reasoned that, since the subjects knew that the decremental test would become progressively easier, their brains would be less likely to pre-emptively apply the brakes in self-defence. Since emotional stress can affect blood flow and metabolism, that knowledge alone could alter their physiological response to exercise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was one further surprise: When the subjects did a final incremental VO2max test at the end of the experiment, the group that had previously performed the decremental test maintained their new higher max – a result that left even Mr. Beltrami puzzled. Whatever additional exercise capacity was unlocked by the novel decremental protocol somehow persisted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the study raises more questions than it answers. But it suggests that some of the limitations we encounter during hard exercise may actually be self-fulfilling prophecies – and that knowing your VO2max is less important than believing that you can go a little faster or a little farther.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alex Hutchinson blogs about research on exercise at sweatscience.com. His new book, Which Comes First, Cardio or Weights?, is now available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN IS VO2MAX NOT MAX?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maximal oxygen uptake, or VO2max, is usually measured on a treadmill or exercise bike with speed increasing incrementally until the subject can't continue. By flipping the test around to start at high speed and then slow down, South African researchers were able to produce “supramaximal” oxygen uptakes that exceeded the max value from conventional tests.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, as Stephen Harper arrives in China, a delegation from Japan begins talks in Washington that could affect Canada's trading future far more than anything that gets signed in Beijing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Japanese badly want to join the Trans Pacific Partnership, an ambitious set of trade negotiations between the United States and eight other Pacific nations that have gone far farther, and faster, than most observers expected. Australian Trade Minister Craig Emerson said last week that he expects to see “something substantial – not a finalized agreement, but substantial – by around July.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't leave much time for the Japanese to get in, or for Canada, either. This country is also eager to join the TPP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But membership has its costs, and some may not be aware how high those costs could be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All nine member countries within the TPP talks – the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Peru, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore and Brunei – must agree before any country can join the talks at this late stage. The Japanese are in Washington to secure the Obama administration's support, but the Americans are demanding a very high price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They want Tokyo to scrap regulations that keep American cars out of the Japanese market. They want the Japanese to eliminate their prohibitive tariffs on rice and other agricultural imports. Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Wendy Cutler has declared that her country will tolerate no exceptions if Japan wants America's support for entry into the TPP. The Japanese, desperate to revive their flagging manufacturing sector, appear willing to agree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that's what the Americans want from the Japanese, it's easy to project what they will want from Canada: an end to the supply-management system that protects dairy and poultry products; an end to restrictions on foreign investment in banks, telecommunications firms, cultural industries and airlines. The talks also aim to harmonize intellectual-property laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One senior official, speaking on background, suggested that Canada's signature on a TPP treaty would amount to a whole new free trade agreement between Canada and the United States, stripping away all of the protections the Mulroney government secured in the original talks, with all the other members of the TPP having access as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if that weren't enough, Nkenge Harmon of the Office of the United States Trade Representative, pointed out in an e-mail exchange that the administration would “want to ensure we have Congressional support … before finalizing a decision about Canada's entry.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What are the chances that the Harper government would agree, even in principle, to scrap supply management, eliminate restrictions on foreign investment – when the Prime Minister himself said recently that he doesn't want to see foreign ownership of such sensitive companies as <span class="companylink">Research in Motion</span> – and surrender sovereignty over copyright law, all for the sake simply joining the TPP talks? One is tempted to reply: zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet officials remain optimistic. International Trade Minister Ed Fast is jetting off to Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore this month, followed by Vietnam in March, to secure the consent of those TPP members. As for the United States, the Canadians are confident that it would be geopolitically unthinkable for the U.S. to support Japan's admission to the TPP while opposing Canada's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And on the question of concessions, officials say the government is prepared to put everything on the table, but only after Canada actually gets admitted to the TPP table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever happens, if the TPP turns out to be as ambitious as everyone involved says it is, joining it would end decades of protection in sectors of the economy that no Canadian government has ever dared tamper with. It will be a brave prime minister who signs his name to such a deal.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time the race is more interesting because right now it encompasses the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s Feb. 27 trade deadline as well as the playoff race. Most of the teams involved – the Florida Panthers, <span class="companylink">Washington Capitals</span>, Winnipeg Jets and Tampa Bay Lightning – could well decide to become sellers rather than buyers in the days leading to the deadline because they could fall quickly out of playoff contention. Or all of them could become buyers because the playoffs are so tantalizingly close thanks to the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s rule that gives the division leaders the top three playoff seeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Florida Panthers lead the turtle race with 59 points, which vaults them all the way to third in the Eastern Conference. But take away their status as division leaders and the Panthers would sit eighth, barely clinging to the final playoff spot, one point ahead of the Capitals, who are officially ninth in the conference standing. Winnipeg and Tampa sit 10th and 11th in the conference with 54 and 51 points, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such is the dilemma that faces the general managers of these teams. One day, you're sitting third in the conference and the next day you're out of playoff contention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The temptation to gamble at the trade deadline must be powerful for three of those GMs. All three – George McPhee of the Capitals, Dale Tallon of the Panthers and Steve Yzerman of the Lightning – are under much pressure to make the playoffs to appease their fans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Panthers have not made the playoffs for 10 consecutive seasons and desperately need a postseason appearance to have any chance of reversing their attendance woes. The Capitals have to find a way to stop their two-year slide from the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s most exciting young team to also-ran and the Bolts have to do likewise after a surprise run to the conference final last year sent a warming trend through their disaffected fan base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only the Jets can afford to miss the playoffs, although capping their honeymoon with the Winnipeg fans with a playoff berth would be nice. However, GM Kevin Cheveldayoff is close-mouthed about his plans for the trade deadline, although it's obvious the Jets need a scoring forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With three offensive-minded defencemen on the roster in Dustin Byfuglien, Tobias Engstrom and Zach Bogosian, the Jets are in position to get the scorer they need. Cheveldayoff also has seven pending unrestricted free agents among his regulars, including goaltender Chris Mason and defenceman Johnny Oduya, as ammunition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheveldayoff will get an indication of what he should do this week. The Jets, who are six points behind the eighth-place Toronto Maple Leafs, have three games this week against teams ahead of them in the race, including the Leafs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Capitals and Pittsburgh Penguins are the other opponents and the Jets need three wins to realistically stay in contention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Capitals have the most control over their own destiny. They have 11 games left within the Southeast Division while the Jets have 10, the Panthers nine and the Lightning eight.</p>

The Lightning won the first one, 6-3 over the Florida Panthers, and will meet the Los Angeles Kings on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, since the Bolts are nine points out of the last Eastern Conference playoff spot and eight points out of the Southeast Division lead, Yzerman's decision should be easy. His most important work should come around the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> entry draft and free agency rather than the Feb. 27 trade deadline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lightning's greatest need is goaltending, which will be a tall order to fill at the deadline. Yzerman is taking calls on winger Ryan Malone and centre Dominic Moore. Malone is a big winger who would be attractive to a contender. Moore is a pending free agent who should attract a decent price because he's a reliable two-way player.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Count Minnesota Wild general manager Chuck Fletcher as a buyer in the next few weeks. The Wild need a playoff appearance to placate an increasingly unhappy fan base. The trouble is, unless prices come down quickly, Fletcher may be stuck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Carolina Hurricanes forward Tuomo Ruutu would fill the Wild's need for a top-six forward. He's also a close friend of Wild captain Mikko Koivu. But Canes GM Jim Rutherford's asking price includes a first-round draft pick so it's unlikely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on Fletcher's shopping list is a top-four defenceman who can move the puck. That would be the same commodity on just about every other GM's list, so good luck with that unless Fletcher is willing to package one of his goaltenders, Niklas Backstrom or Josh Harding. The latter goalie, by the way, will be an unrestricted free agent July 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SITTING PRETTY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Brian Burke has his eye on a top-six forward, as always, with James Van Riemsdyk of the Philadelphia Flyers, Jeff Carter of the Columbus Blue Jackets and Tuomo Ruutu of the Carolinia Hurricanes the prize quantities. Throw in Ryan Malone of the Tampa Bay Lightning as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Carter is out with a separated shoulder, he may not be at the top of Burke's list depending on how close to the Feb. 27 <span class="companylink">NHL</span> trade deadline a deal is made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Burke has more ammunition than he has ever had since becoming the Leafs GM in late 2008. Most of his peers are looking for an experienced defenceman and Burke has several of those, plus a few forward prospects, that he could deal for the right player.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also forwards Nazem Kadri, Matt Frattin and Joe Colborne to consider if the deal is a big one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GAGNER secure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't expect to see the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s hottest player, forward Sam Gagner, to be part of any trades the Edmonton Oilers may or may not make. He followed up his eight-point night last week with three points against the Detroit Red Wings, keeping his name bubbling in trade rumours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Gagner, 22, remains part of the Oilers' core of young forwards even though he was having a mediocre season until his heroics last week. Ales Hemsky remains the most likely Oilers player to be moved if general manager Steve Tambellini can get a decent price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But one name to watch is winger Ryan Smith, who is enjoying a good season with 36 points in 52 games. He is not keen to leave Edmonton, since he engineered his return last summer for family reasons, but might be talked into something. Smyth becomes a free agent this summer so a deal could be struck if he agrees to move to a team that agrees to a strictly rental deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIVE GAMES TO WATCH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oilers at Maple Leafs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edmonton forward Sam Gagner carries his streak of 11 points in two games into the Air Canada Centre with Toronto looking to squelch him and keep its two-game winning streak going. Monday, 7 p.m., Sportsnet Ontario, Sportsnet West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blues at Senators</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">St. Louis goaltender Brian Elliott had a bitter parting with Ottawa last season when he was sent to the Colorado Avalanche at the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> trade deadline before landing as a free agent with the Blues. He should be the starter against his old team. Tuesday, 7:30 p.m., Sportsnet East.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maple Leafs at Jets</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a big game for both teams, as Toronto holds eighth place in the Eastern Conference and Winnipeg is gunning for it. Tuesday, 8:30 p.m., Sportsnet Ontario, TSN-Jets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flames at Sharks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary started the week four points out of the last playoff spot in the Western Conference but is on the rise with a 6-3-1 record in its past 10 games. A win over San Jose would show there could be something to this run. Wednesday, 10 p.m., TSN.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canucks at Flames</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As noted above, the Flames need to start knocking off the better teams in their conference while the Canucks are trying to get back into first place. Saturday, 10 p.m., CBC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All times Eastern</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Question</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am in excellent health and rarely require any medical treatment. I last saw a doctor two years ago. But should I need care that requires a wait in Canada, I would opt to pay for care in the United States. Other than asking my family doctor, where else can I go?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A wait, as you know, doesn't necessarily spell a worse medical outcome – many patients can safely queue for certain tests, procedures and operations – so your question is largely about wanting timely medical treatment or at least having a Plan B should you seek a diagnosis in a pinch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., patients with cash are king: Many hospitals there have the opposite problem of Canada – they have excess capacity. So for those institutions, having a patient in a hospital bed at a lower rate is better than an empty bed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another thing you should know: No one pays the rack rate; expect about a 30-per-cent price cut if paying cash for a procedure. Given the downturn in the economy, I would negotiate hard for an even bigger discount. Don't feel you necessarily have to be in big medical centres of New York and Boston; hospitals in Oklahoma and Montana may pleasantly surprise you with equally impressive outcomes for routine procedures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a tendency to overtreat patients in the U.S. Back surgery is heavily marketed and it can be seductive if you are a Canadian patient facing a one-year wait to see a spine surgeon. But what they don't know is that as many as 90 per cent queuing for that first consult with the surgeon later learn they are not surgical candidates in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be cautious of experimental treatments; you want care that is based on the best medical evidence. The only exception is if you have a relatively rare condition – where you will need to find a world-class physician who specializes in that area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot of care can be found online. One website operates a medical-bidding service, allowing Canadian and American patients to post the medical procedure they seek, such as second opinions, diagnostic procedures, knee-replacement surgery or even a new cancer treatment. U.S. doctors come back with custom quotes and their credentials; patients take their pick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others patients hire medical brokers, some of whom have good connections and special provider rates with certain U.S. hospitals. But beware: A recent five-year study of medical-tourism companies that operated in Canada found that about half – 25 businesses – had ceased operations by March, 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Quite a number arrived on the scene then disappeared from view,” said Leigh Turner, associate professor of the University of Minnesota's Center for Bioethics, School of Public Health and College of Pharmacy. “If someone goes through a medical tourism company, they may get a better deal and they may not.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you choose a medical broker, make sure it is an established one that has been around for years. And don't be afraid to shop around; there are huge deals to be had.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Did Quebec's social services fail the Shafia women? In hindsight, it's easy to say yes. But the real question is whether, at the time, there was enough reason to remove the teenagers from their family.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contrary to some press reports, there were no “repeated cries” for help. Over the course of two years, the Montreal child-protection system was called only twice. Each time, the social workers reacted promptly, but what they saw provided no sign there was a child at risk. The Shafia girls were well-dressed and healthy. They didn't even wear veils. They hadn't been molested. None of the signs associated with child abuse (alcohol, drugs, sexual promiscuity) were present.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their basic complaint was that they were afraid of their father. But how many teenagers growing up in repressive households aren't? Another complaint – that they didn't have enough freedom – was again typical adolescent behaviour. And two of the girls recanted their accusations – again, typical behaviour from ambivalent immigrant kids caught in cultural and generational conflicts, torn between rebellion and submission, anger at and love for their parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much has been said about the fact that, at the time, Quebec had no provincewide registry of the various agencies' interventions. Would it have raised a red flag if the second team of social workers had known of an earlier intervention? This is far from certain; in Quebec at least, child protection agencies and the courts are extremely careful when it comes to removing a child from their natural environment. Breaking up a family and sending kids to foster homes can be much more damaging than keeping them in a dysfunctional household.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any case, who could have foreseen that a father could coldly engineer the murder of three daughters? The only people who intuited that Mohammad Shafia might have criminal intentions were relatives of his first wife, Rona Amir, who had confided to her sister that she feared for her life, as well as relatives of his second wife, Tooba Yahya, who'd testified they'd heard him say that Zainab, the 19-year-old daughter, was a “slut” and that he wanted to kill her. They had personal contact with the family and knew about the oppressive atmosphere in the family home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These people were from Afghanistan, and they knew about the “honour code.” But even they apparently couldn't envision the monstrous scenario that would take place. A cousin of Zainab who lives in Montreal told the National Post that the worst he feared for her was that she would be forcibly sent to Dubai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These relatives, even with their knowledge of Afghan culture, couldn't really believe Mr. Shafia would act on his threats. But when they learned of the “accident,” they instantly knew something was wrong, and Rona Amir's sister contacted police.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the aftermath of the Shafia tragedy, the social agencies will undoubtedly refine their ways of dealing with communities whose cultures are steeped in medieval “honour codes,” but the people who can best prevent the repetition of such crimes are those who live within these communities: friends, relatives and community leaders.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Battle of Ontario is back – on paper, anyway.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem was translating it onto the ice Saturday night as the <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span> – looking alarmingly like last year's stumbling team – were routed 5-0 by the Toronto Maple Leafs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should never have gone this way, given that both teams are barely hanging on to playoff positions and the falling Senators, having lost five games in a row heading into the match, needed to put some distance between themselves and the rising Leafs. Seventh-place Ottawa went into the contest with a three-point lead over the Leafs, who held down the eighth and final playoff spot. Now Ottawa stands but a single point in front, with the Leafs having three games in hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senators, the great surprise of the NHL during the first half of the season, showed this night why some are saying they might also be the surprise of the second half – only in the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We just have to play with emotion instead of going through the motions,” said a disappointed Jared Cowan, Ottawa's young defenceman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That was disappointing,” centre Jason Spezza added. “We've got to find a way to start winning some games.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senators played much of the night as if they were, once again, the discombobulated, confused Senators of a year ago, when management decided to blow up the roster heading into the trade deadline and start the current season with multiple new faces, a new coach and new resolve. Up to recently, it had worked wonders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, through two early power plays, Saturday's Senators were incapable of sustaining pressure in the Toronto end. The best scoring chances went to the short-handed Leafs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're pretty confident on the bench,” head coach Ron Wilson said of the Toronto penalty kill. “It's an entirely different feeling now.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto went ahead 1-0 when Phil Kessel swept down the left side and fired a hard shot that Ottawa defenceman Matt Carkner blocked. Kessel, however, picked up the rebound and fired a hard wrist shot to the far side of the net past goaltender Craig Anderson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wilson said when Kessel gets a quick start to his game, as happened this night, “you can feel it. He had a lot of energy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto went ahead by two on their own power play when Kessel threaded a brilliant pass to pinching defenceman Dion Phaneuf and the Toronto captain quickly beat Anderson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kessel, clearly the star of the night, later made a seeing-eye pass half the length of the Scotiabank Place ice surface when he sent Tyler Bozak in alone in the second period and Bozak flipped the puck over a falling Anderson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Playing his 16th straight game, Anderson looked tired at times, though he was ill served by his teammates, who seemed unable to attack and at times had trouble defending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The game should have had for more intensity, given the reality of the standings and the air of expectation that greeted the players as they skated out for the warm-up. The sellout crowd of 20,500 seemed split almost perfectly in half. Early scoreboard close-ups of Ottawa captain Daniel Alfredsson, as beloved as North Korea's Dear Leader only a week earlier in the all-star game, produced loud, drawn-out booing by the thousands of blue-and-white jerseys in attendance. Ottawa fans, of course, cheered just as loudly in retaliation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The game itself, however, failed to live up to that early billing. The best hit of the night was on the scoreboard, when a small youngster encouraged by his mother to swing his mini-stick, clobbered the fan sitting directly in front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the Senators could not score, even though they were using real sticks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luke Schenn, with his second goal of the season, raised the lead to 4-0 for the Leafs when he was sent a cross-ice pass by Bozak, walked in and fired a hard wrist shot past Anderson. It was Bozak's third point of the night. Joffrey Lupul had sent the puck to Bozak, giving Lupul his second assist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later in the third period, Cody Franson scored when the Ottawa defence, baffled by themselves, allowed the defenceman to slip into the corner of the net, where he calmly wrested the puck into the short side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Reimer, playing only as required, had the easy shutout despite the clock claiming he saw 49 shots. Few were dangerous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It looks like he's found his game,” Wilson said of his previously struggling goaltender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reimer was understandably delighted with his shutout. “I wish I could take credit for it,” he said, “but we had guys who played unbelievable.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kessel-Lupul-Bozak line had eight points in the game and led the charge in this Battle of Ontario that so badly fizzled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're chasing these guys,” Lupul said. “It's a team that we marked. We want to pass these guys.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senators played like marked men this night as they dropped their sixth straight game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Was that all-star game really only a week ago?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney thinks the United States is in permanent economic disarray. At best, it will take the country years to recover. At worst, it will never recover. “It's going to take a number of years before they get back to the U.S. that we used to know,” Mr. Carney told CTV's Question Period. “In fact, they are not in our opinion ultimately going to get back fully to the U.S. we used to know.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, perhaps. He could be right. (U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke appears to agree with him.) But he could be wrong – as noted historian and political science scholar Charles Doran, for one, would readily affirm. In a January musing on Canadian-U.S. relations, he said: “Misjudging either the vitality of the American political system, or the capacity of the U.S. economy to recover, is a fool's game.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prof. Doran, an American, is a professor of international relations and director of Canadian studies at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. He developed the “power cycle” theory of the rise and fall of great states – the latter of which, he says, almost always ends in great wars. On this basis, we must hope Mr. Carney is wrong. A never-ending American recession would surely imply a cataclysmic “power cycle” event of one kind or another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prof. Doran understands why people think the U.S. is in decline. “Oh America!” he writes. “Still buried in a painful recovery from recession, while coping with record 9 per cent unemployment levels, the United States appears unable to reach conclusive decisions about a strategic path for recovery. At least to outsiders, the two-party political system seems fatefully polarized. … The United States seems less dominant on the world stage.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it would be a serious mistake to underestimate America, he says. “Still by far the largest and richest economy in the world, possessing the most flexible and massive military capability, which remains the backstop of global order, the United States enjoys a diverse and balanced economy marked by a capacity for innovation and entrepreneurship.” The invention of shale gas “fracking,” he says, is only the most recent example. The coming U.S. recovery will be based on a stronger foundation than ever: the highest labour productivity in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further, the U.S. political process is not as dizzy as it appears, Prof. Doran says. “Politics in the time of James Madison was no less turbulent than it is today. … Despite the noise and contention, the bills do get paid.” Watch for a return to sanity after the November election, he says. Whoever wins, the Keystone XL oil pipeline will be approved – and everyone knows it. “Washington has not given up on the 21st century – far from it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carney's pessimistic prediction implies turbulence for Canada – whether the U.S. recovery is merely prolonged or whether it's permanent. In an average recovery, he notes, American GDP would already be 2.5 per cent higher and Canadian exports would be 6.5 per cent greater. This weak U.S. recovery means that Canadian businesses have lost $30-billion in export sales – so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Extrapolate this slow recovery across a decade, Mr. Carney says, and the cumulative loss of income could equal $30,000 for every man, woman and child in Canada. Canadians would be well advised to pray for a speedier U.S. economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not to despair. Economists who predict the future are frequently wrong. Historians who predict the future are frequently wrong, too. In neither profession does prognostication imply predestination. But chances are that Prof. Doran is more apt to be right on American manifest destiny than Mr. Carney. Prof. Doran's expectations are shaped more by the character of the country than by thousands of statistical data points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For his part, Prof. Doran anticipates that history's next “power cycle” peak will coincide with wrenching economic turbulence in China – the country Mr. Carney thinks essential to safeguard Canada from U.S. decline. Prof. Doran sees an abrupt end to China's “accelerating rise up its power cycle.” When China's economy hits the wall, he says, the country will enter a period of social collapse and national paranoia that will require major U.S. help – “beyond trade and commerce” – to survive. He could be wrong. But he could be right.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I want a beach vacation – and I want to leave this week on a last-minute sale to escape winter. What vaccinations really matter? What can I do to minimize my risk for diseases?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting sick while travelling can certainly put a damper on the relaxation planned, so it's good that you're thinking ahead for a healthy trip. In general, I suggest reviewing your health needs a month or two prior to leaving on a trip as it will allow sufficient time to get any needed vaccinations. That said, even though you're leaving within the week there's still some preparation you can do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take food and water precautions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traveller's diarrhea is unpleasant and avoidable with a couple of easy tips. If you're travelling somewhere that it is unclear if the water is safe, drink strictly bottled water. Watch out for ice cubes too unless it is indicated that they are made with distilled water. Contaminated food that isn't boiled or cooked can also harbour bacteria that make you sick. For fresh fruit and vegetables, eat those you can peel and avoid the skins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Get vaccinated</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Depending on where you're travelling, different infections can be common. Prior to travelling, check out the Public Health Agency of Canada's website for country-specific recommended vaccines or travel advisories(phac-aspc.gc.ca/tmp-pmv). In general, it can take time for vaccines to take effect to help your body build immunity. Plan to get vaccinated about four to eight weeks prior to leaving. If you're leaving in a shorter period, there are some accelerated options that you can use. In addition to travel vaccines for hepatitis A and B, it would be prudent to update your tetanus vaccine and get the flu shot if it's flu season when you're travelling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take a small first aid kit</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minor cuts, scrapes, skin infections and diarrhea are common and can be managed with some over-the-counter medications; pack some of these important supplies so you're not left without or have to pay high fees. Consider bandages, antibiotic ointment, pain, anti-diarrheals and something for nausea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Protect yourself from bug bites</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're going to an area where malaria or dengue are present, use insect repellent with 30-per-cent DEET. Wear long pants and long sleeves to avoid bug bites and sleep using a bed net if malaria is a concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sleep and eat well</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may be hard to maintain your regular schedule, but eating well, hydrating and getting good rest will help combat jet lag, keep your immune system strong and help you stay healthy on a trip.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today marks the 60th anniversary of the accession to the throne of Queen Elizabeth II, and so also represents a milestone in the life of Canada. In 1951, Princess Elizabeth declared, “We belong to Canada.” The following year, she was Queen of Canada, and in the intervening years we have all been witness to the truth of that statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Queen has shared in major moments in the life of the country. She opened the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959 with U.S. president Dwight Eisenhower, during what's been called the last great royal progress, a 45-day tour that saw her, with Prince Philip at her side, travel 15,000 miles across Canada. The Queen attended Expo 67, opened the Montreal Olympics in 1976 and the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton and in Victoria in 1994. She proclaimed the Constitution Act, 1982, on Parliament Hill, and helped raise the country's spirits after the failure of the Meech Lake Accord in 1990, saying she was “not a fair-weather friend.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed she has not been.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Crown is inextricably part of Canada's national identity, representing Canada's traditions and all those old virtues, duty, loyalty, service and community. But the Crown also represents Canada's present, its democratic institutions and the respect for the rule of law, and if the enormously enthusiastic crowds last summer for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are any indication, it represents Canada's future as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Queen has served this country with dignity, graciousness and wisdom, and she is deservedly held in great esteem by Canadians. Not many Canadians remember a time when she was not there, and many hold personal memories of the sovereign over those six decades. In many respects, what the poet Ted Hughes once wrote is true, that they see in this Queen “their life.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the first of 60,000 Canadians will be honoured by the Queen and the country, with the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal. The medal is deeply meaningful, in that it comes from the monarch and is also in commemoration of her. So we pause to reflect on the young woman whose accession occurred in Kenya, at 25, and her notion of devotion to service, loyalty and larger values of community, which has remained unaltered throughout her life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are in the sunset years of what is likely to be our longest, and perhaps most successful reign. Even agnostics might on this occasion be tempted to say God Save the Queen.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My feet pronate when I run. What can I do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ankle should primarily be a hinge joint that brings your toes toward and then away from your shin. During pronation, the foot points out to the side, and the inner arch rolls in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you pronate while running, the muscles of the knee, hip and back have to alter their recruitment patterns to compensate for the pronation, and over time this can cause injury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help retrain the muscles of the foot and ankle, try this exercise to improve foot alignment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Sit in a chair with your feet bare, parallel and shoulder width apart. Equally distribute your weight on your big toe and both sides of your heel. Lift up your arch and create space between it and the floor. Imagine you are forming a dome with your arch. Hold for five seconds. Repeat five-10 times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Stand on your right leg in front of a mirror so you can watch your form.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, make sure your weight is evenly distributed on your big toe and both sides of your heel. “Dome” the foot while standing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Watch for two things in the mirror:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't let your knee cave inward; keep your knee cap in line with your middle toe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Watch your pelvis, and make sure both hip bones are level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aim to hold perfect alignment for five seconds. Work up to holding for 30 seconds. Repeat on left leg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trainer's tip</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you pronate, most likely your peroneal muscles (which run lengthwise up the outside of your lower legs) are tight. You can use a foam roller to help release them. Lie on the floor on your side, legs stacked together, with a foam roller tucked perpendicularly under the bottom leg. Use your arms to prop up your upper body (like a plank position) and then propel yourself in a head-to-toes motion. The roller will move up and down your leg, massaging the muscles. Flip over and repeat for the other leg.</p>

It will spark more talk about possible changes to Old Age Security, but it should also help people ponder another social program under siege: medicare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians are living longer, with more diseases. A growing number are developing multiple chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure and kidney disease. Many of these are not sexy illnesses; you will never see the image of an arthritic hand on a hospital building, as you see a heart.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimated 16 million Canadians live with at least one chronic condition. They go from specialist to specialist and take several drugs. Some lack proper care until a medical crisis hits. Others are dubbed frequent fliers for their large number of emergency department visits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only is their care inefficient and inconvenient, it's costly: one per cent of the population consumes about 50 per cent of health costs, due to both hospitalization and home care. They also require a high proportion of readmissions to hospital – a matter of particular concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report by the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences more than a year ago suggested that patients with chronic health conditions should be able to access care with a team of clinicians who can co-ordinate those services throughout their lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some institutions have acted on this. Women's College Hospital in Toronto opened a centre last summer that provides a form of one-stop shopping for patients. There, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, dieticians and other health-care providers are in the same area to treat patients with multiple medical conditions. This common-sense, low-tech health innovation has so far treated 590 patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada faces an enormous demographic shift. Some time between 2015 and 2021, there will be more people aged 65 and older than those 14 and under. Some of these seniors will be spry and healthy, while others will have numerous medical problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The aging demographic will be a test for Canada's health care. It should be seen as an opportunity for a transformation in which innovations put patients first. Unless hospital and health-care providers adapt, we will be doing a disservice to future generations.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Ontario Health Minister Deb Matthews unveiled “An Action Plan for Health Care” in a speech to the Toronto Board of Trade.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was an hour of grand ideas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who could possibly take issue with a plan to make Ontario health care more patient-centred, community-based, efficient, cost-effective, accessible, and sustainable?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who doesn't want health care delivery to be faster, safer, cheaper, better? Who doesn't want a seamless system, from the birth of every child by a midwife through to a gentle death in palliative care, with care delivered in the community by a team of loving health professionals at every stage in between?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our goal is to make Ontario the healthiest place in North America to grow up and grow old, by making sure families get the best health care where and when they need it,” Ms. Matthews said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we've been served these bromides so many times before that they have lost their fizz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When are we going to see specific, concrete goals? When are we going to see large-scale action rather than an endless series of grand pronouncements and feel-good pilot projects? For example, instead of vague talk of birthing centres, why doesn't Ontario set a specific target of half of all babies being delivered by midwives within five years? (It is a perversity that the leading cause of hospital admission in this country remains childbirth. Where is the evidence to justify this practice?) Every province and territory faces the exact same challenge: reining in health spending. And they have all responded the same way: with banalities and more of the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report released last week, the Conference Board of Canada put Ontario's challenge in stark terms, saying if the province wants to balance its budget by 2017, it needs to limit program spending increases to 0.7 per cent a year. Ontario has limited health spending increases to this level only once in its history. (We will come back to the how of this in a moment.) There are really only two ways to control health spending: 1) Reduce the services covered by public health insurance – which doesn't reduce overall health costs but shifts them to employers and consumers; 2) Deliver existing services more efficiently (read: cheaper).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In her speech, Ms. Matthews addressed the first point briefly, saying: “If there is not evidence to support a procedure or a test, we don't want to pay for it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nice sentiment but how are you going to do it concretely? How are you going to determine what's in the medicare basket of services and what's out? Health Quality Ontario has helped examine the evidence but it doesn't have any real power to determine what services are listed or de-listed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Medicare – public health insurance – is supposed to pay only for “medically necessary” care but, in reality, the list of services covered is virtually open-ended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, news reports suggested, for example, that Ontario would no longer pay for elective cesarean sections, a perfectly sensible policy. There was an outcry and the minister quickly backed down. So the province limits itself to delisting trivial things like vitamin D tests. That's hardly going to wrestle to the ground a $47-billion annual health budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So let's look at how to make health-care delivery more efficient and cost-effective. One of the pillars of Ms. Matthews's plan is to ensure “the right care, at the right time, in the right place.” She promised to do so with a series of initiatives:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Better access to primary care: The minister said everyone should be able to get an appointment within a day. How? That's not really clear;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Stand-alone surgery clinics: Build clinics that do specialized surgery like cataracts or hip replacements and move these procedures out of hospital. A good idea, one that's been the norm in some countries for decades;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* More home care: Ontario will offer three million more hours of home support to get patients out of hospital sooner. Again, nice on the surface, but the reality is that home-care services available to any given patient are quite limited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not enough to say you want to shift care to the community without addressing the flip side of the equation. Community care will only save money if you close hospital beds or, more to the point, entire hospitals. But Ontario is building new hospitals not closing them. How does that jibe?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When action plans are announced, as they are routinely, the elephant in the room always remains unaddressed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In health care, almost two-thirds of all spending goes to wages. This is not, in itself, outrageous. Health care is and should be labour-intensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the early 1990s, when overall health spending fell, the goal was achieved brutally, through massive layoffs of nurses and support staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2003, Ontario has added 3,000 physicians, 12,000 nurses and 1,000 nurse practitioners to its payroll. That's what's driving health spending, not an aging population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are layoffs in anybody's action plan? The only alternative to cutting staff is to ensure every health professional works to their full scope of practice – meaning, practically, that we stop having highly-paid health professionals do what lower-cost employees can do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contract talks with the Ontario Medical Association are imminent. Will the province be able to chip away at doctors' turf protection and hold the line on salaries? History tells us no.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, a 1 per cent increase in physician compensation costs as much as home care for 30,000 seniors. That is just one example of the stark tradeoffs that await.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until politicians realize that their calculators have a subtraction key, health-care spending will never be reined in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Action Plan for Health Care to have any meaning, there has to be action at the bargaining table, not just soothing words at the Board of Trade.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experience of signing up for Pinterest can be disorienting, especially if you're not into rainbow-knit socks. One minute, the Internet is a comfortable place for those whose interests run toward, say, spaceships. The next, it's all cookie-dough brownies, sheep-shaped cupcakes, bamboo kitchenware and stencilled floor patterns for the back patio.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pinterest is a newish social network that lets users bookmark and share links. But instead of using words, like so many bookmarking sites before it, it uses pictures. Having seemingly emerged from nowhere, it is now being described as one of the top 10 social networks, and a potent new force in online sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's one other factor that sets it apart: Unlike previous web phenomena that emerged from the male-centric world of technology, or the youth-heavy world of youth, Pinterest is a social network that – without many signs of conspicuous catering – has been chiefly populated and powered by women. It's reported that almost 60 per cent of users are female, between the ages of 22 and 44, but in practice, that feels like a lowball estimate. (For now, you have to request an invitation to the site, which only took a few days for me.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's how it works: As users browse the web, they might happen to see things they like, be it rainbow socks, a nice stool or a picture of an actor. With the click of a button that Pinterest pops into your browser toolbar, you can take any image and “pin” it onto a digital pinboard. Every picture on the pinboard links back to the website it came from, like a visual bookmark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, users can have as many pinboards as they like, to organize their links however they choose: One for cats. One for furniture. One for goods they'd (cough, cough) like to acquire, and so on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, it's a way of sharing links: Pinterest users “follow” each other, just as one would follow someone on Instagram or Twitter. Users spend their time browsing each others' boards and “repinning” things they like, which reposts the image their own board, propagating the image. More often than not, these images are of products; so Pinterest also becomes a popularity-contest bazaar, where millions of people mill around objects of desire, iterating and reiterating their desire for each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is difficult to assay a social network until you've had the chance to find your niche there. Opening a Pinterest account is a jarring experience if your tastes do not line up with its natural inclinations. At present, its natural inclinations are twee. Despite my professed interest in design and architecture, my screen filled up with pictures of rainbow socks (and rainbow-sock-type items), recommended by contacts that the site had produced for me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I started asking around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's kind of a woman's' thing, and I don't want to say it's a woman's thing,” said Lesley Pysklywec, a kindergarten teacher in Toronto. Ms. Pysklywec has been on the site for a year, and uses it as a bookmarking tool, clipping out items to use in class. “For someone who's a visual person, it's brilliant. I can see exactly what I pinned and why.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, she said, Pinterest is also attracting communities of interest around shared interests like favourite actors (the name Benedict Cumberbatch – elfin star of the new Sherlock Holmes series – came up).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there's the shopping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I buy a lot online. I'm always bookmarking stuff on my browser, but I'm always forgetting about it,” said Claudia Lemire, a corporate public relations worker in Calgary, who cheerfully explained that she'd taken to buying things she never knew she wanted until she saw pictures on Pinterest. (Japanese bento boxes: “Completely addicted!”)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure enough, a lot of these bookmarked product images come from – you guessed it – online shopping pages. So one click of an appealing object on a pinboard can easily land you at a checkout page, from which a purchase is a mere click away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wondered aloud whether we'd soon be reading stories about people with Pinterest shopping addictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Oh, yeah,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a novel thing, for the technology-oriented male to find himself on the wrong side of a new social network. So many web phenomena were incubated in the world of tech-friendly nerdery that it's eye-opening to find the (vintage) shoe on the other foot: This must be what it was like for people with no interest in social media or gadgetry to venture onto Twitter in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, the gender imbalance suffuses the site with a weirdly explicit demarcation of “what girls like” and “what boys like.” Faced with the screen of rainbow socks and their ilk, I hunted around the site to find users who were posting picture-links that were more up my alley. I found a guy who collected, say, wartime naval photos, and followed him. Suddenly my screen was full of flaming destroyers – and rainbow socks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps some realties of gender-specific marketing are coming home to roost on an Internet that likes to think itself above such things. But there's also no reason to assume that Pinterest will remain as it is today. It's a fun site, with a compelling premise that's broadly appealing. As more users arrive, it will evolve away from the communities of interest that have powered it so far, and into an ecosystem with a more robust, less twee cultural offering. I can only believe that men and women alike have a limited appetite for the feeling of being trapped in the world's largest Muskoka gift shop.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The justice system is the main tool Canada has for curbing the mob behaviour seen in the Vancouver riot last spring, and putting television cameras in the courtroom during the riot trials (as proposed by the Crown) would make that tool more powerful and effective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who else can urban centres depend on to fight mass hooliganism? The police can't control 100,000 or more people raging through the streets. Shop owners can't defend their shops, and vigilantes can't (or at least shouldn't) patrol the streets. Internet shaming, using video or still photos, probably doesn't have much deterrent effect. The courts are the most important line of defence.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Vancouver riot that followed the Stanley Cup final on June 15 was a peculiarly public crime, an attack on the notion of safe public spaces. Putting cameras in the courtroom would help the public reassert itself through its institutions, regain control of its city and defeat the mob. That is the notion of a public justice system. There is really nothing revolutionary about a TV camera. It enhances the public nature of the courts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The riot was about anonymity, or at least an illusion of anonymity, granting individuals licence to destroy, apparently for fun. The TV cameras are about lifting the anonymity, about showing the mob as individuals, human after all, and each capable of judgment, each with an ability to understand right and wrong. (They are not really about shaming the guilty, though they may accomplish that.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision on the TV cameras falls to the trial judges hearing the cases, beginning this Friday. Those judges should be wary of handing a veto to defendants, as set out in guidelines written by the B.C. Supreme Court for requests to allow TV cameras in court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guidelines are not rules. The B.C. guidelines say that “any witness, counsel or other participant” who objects to being identified or shown on TV “must not be recorded.” It is hard to square that “must not” with age-old ideas of publicity being the soul of justice. TV cameras would help fulfill the promise of a public, fair-minded justice system with the power to discourage a repeat of the attack on Vancouver.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the B.C. government unveils a new budget later this month, many will be looking to see what it does to address the deepening crisis in the court system. A day doesn't go by now that a judge or veteran lawyer isn't issuing apocalyptic warnings about its imminent collapse as a result of a lack of funding.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of it is overstated rhetoric, but much of it is not. The facts on the ground are real.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of cases on the edge of being thrown out because of unreasonable delays sits at more than 2,500. These involve defendants charged with everything from attempted murder to drug dealing to drunk driving. In some cases, the accused have committed other crimes while awaiting trial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 109 youth and criminal cases stayed in 2011, which is almost double the number from the previous year. Despite hiring 14 new judges in the past two years, the province is still 17 judges short of 2005 levels, which is helping create historic backlogs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, only the Vancouver Canucks' win-loss record gets as much air time as those numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things are so bad that the usually taciturn Robert Bauman, chief justice of the B.C. Supreme Court, has said publicly that the system is “going over a cliff in slow motion” as a result of funding cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in an apparent attempt to grab the public's attention on the issue, one judge recently raised the spectre of a serial child sex offender going free as a result of systemic court delays. As damaging as those comments were, worse for the government was the story in a Vancouver tabloid about how an over-burdened justice system ignored the case of a little boy whose puppy was shot by a hunter. Readers were incensed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those are the kind of tales that make governments tremble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There isn't anyone connected with the legal system who doesn't think it will only get worse. The B.C. Criminal Justice Branch, in charge of all criminal prosecutions in the province, has been asked to trim $6-million from its budget this year. Meantime, the province's legal-aid budget has been hacked by 35 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of this, obviously, is good news for the government of Liberal Premier Christy Clark. It's no secret that the defeat of the harmonized sales tax blew a $1.6-billion hole in the province's finances, and if the government is going to meet its commitment to balance the books by 2013-14, it has to find savings somewhere. Good luck trying to slash health-care spending – which inhales about half of the treasury each year. Ms. Clark has the other 50 per cent of her budget with which to work, which includes the court system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it's inconceivable the government won't find some new money to address the ever-alarmist concerns being expressed about the sorry state of the legal system. Remember, Ms. Clark and her party trail badly in the polls and are being particularly damaged by the resurgent B.C. Conservatives. Claims that they are disregarding an over-burdened and underfunded court system leave the Liberals' right flank even more exposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the party doesn't own the law-and-order agenda, the likelihood of recouping the critical support leaking to the Conservatives diminishes greatly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that said, it's difficult not to have some sympathy for the government on this matter. Funding is but one part of the problem when it comes to the slow crawl of justice in B.C. The many delays are also the result of the system itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has become a complex, legal morass. Lawyers working every angle help ensure that cases move along haltingly. Many of our laws, especially those concerning evidence and disclosure, only add to a judge's burden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For evidence look no further than the infamous <span class="companylink">BC Rail</span> case, which took more than six years. Only a small fraction of that time was spent on the actual trial. Most was gobbled up in pretrial hearings, fighting about issues like disclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Money isn't the cure to all that ails our legal system in Canada. Sure, governments can ding taxpayers so we can hire more judges and more lawyers and give them the raises they are demanding. But that is not dealing with the greater underlying cause of court delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major reforms of our legal system are needed. Everyone seems to agree on that. Unfortunately, it's not a problem you can fix simply by throwing money at it.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I want to travel but I don't want to volunteer. What can I do to be more respectful of the local culture on a regular vacation?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ANSWER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the depths of Canadian winter the appeal of a warm, sunny holiday is undeniable. If your concept of getting away from it all includes volunteer labour, that's cool, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just by being a tourist, you're contributing to what in many places is a major source of a community's income. Strive to maximize that effect by choosing locally owned hotels, restaurants, tour operators and shops as much as possible. That means doing some online digging ahead and asking around when you arrive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be a respectful tourist, remember to ask before taking pictures, learn a few words and key phrases in the local language, be environmentally conscious, and research local customs regarding issues like appropriate dress, bargaining, tipping and public displays of affection. Some experienced travellers suggest picturing yourself as a guest in someone else's home, rather than a tourist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For us, respecting another culture means learning about it. We enjoy a beach holiday every once in a while, but people's perspective of Latin America and the developing world shouldn't end there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A couple years ago we took a holiday to Cuba. We hopped in a taxi, paid the driver for the day, and asked him to take us on a scavenger hunt of sorts that would allow us to explore the hidden gems of Havana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our first stop was our last. We asked for help finding a place that sells old maps (we're really into maps – perhaps a side effect of having teachers for parents), and soon we were in a small bookstore chatting for hours with the owner as we pored over his collection. Some dated back to the 1600s, some had the south of the world on top, and others had large swaths of South America blank because they had yet to be explored. It was a map-geek's paradise that we would have never found on the beach or within the all-inclusive comfort zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For us, on that day, it was maps. Sometimes it's African masks or books by local authors. For you it may be architecture, music or theatre. Wherever we go, we try to learn more about the culture around us – seeking conversations.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The extent to which the Conservatives' propaganda machine will go was illustrated last week by the news, courtesy of The Canadian Press, of the staging of a Potemkin-village-style citizenship reaffirmation ceremony.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only three bona fide new Canadians could be found for last October's event, so at least six federal bureaucrats suited up as imposters for the PR show broadcast by Sun TV. In a control-freak kingdom, this one – “a full North Korean,” as one wag put it – is hard to top.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News of the charade came on the heels of Stephen Harper's proclamations in Davos on the wonders of the Canadian economy as piloted by a Finance Minister who, he said, is the greatest on Earth. The Prime Minister's musings on the need for pension reform were reasonable enough. But his ever-soaring estimations of his economic record are starting to be challenged by many observers, as well they might be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 2007 to 2011, Canada's economic performance put us in the middle of the pack in GDP growth among 34 industrialized countries. Our unemployment rate is currently rising and nearing the U.S. level. It's true that, comparatively speaking, we're doing well on a number of other economic indices. But given the advantages the Conservatives enjoyed when they took office – the big surplus, the well-regulated financial sector, the natural-resource-laden riches – how much of an accomplishment is it? When you start a race a lap ahead of the field, how hard is it to be among the leaders?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To talk of the Tory economic record, we might first address the reddened state of our treasury that's occasioning the cuts in the coming budget. A pertinent question is whether our deficit is the result of natural economic factors or whether it owes itself to vote-getting political expediency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this context, let's recall a few things. Let's recall the two-point GST cut that tore a giant hole in the revenue base, accounting for a good deal of the deficit. Let's recall the prerecession spending – having inherited a $13-billion surplus, the Harper/Flaherty team spent so excessively that we were close to a deficit by the time the recession began. Let's recall the slashing of corporate tax rates and the government's easing of mortgage rules and backing of risky loans that further bled the treasury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Put it all together and what it shows is that, with more prudent fiscal management from the same guy who lectured other countries on debt in Davos, we could have coped with the recession without driving our treasury into a large deficit hole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some other things should be recalled. In the fall of 2008, when the economic crisis hit, was the dynamic Harper/Flaherty duo on top of things? Or were they still saying that the budget would remain in balance and that there was no need for stimulus spending, and bringing in a foolhardy budget update that almost brought their government down?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the opposition parties putting a gun to their head, they introduced a stimulus package that virtually every other country was doing. With the exception of Tory logos on cheques and Tony Clement's G8 spending boondoggle, it was not badly administered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Flaherty has performed more ably in the past couple of years. But what's in his record that makes him the greatest finance minister in the world?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the coming squeeze the Tories talk about on health care and Old Age Security, is it smart economic management to commit a staggering $30-billion to increasingly discredited F-35 warplanes? It's nice that, on trade diversification, the government is waking up to China. But how many years did Ottawa ignore it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was talking to a plugged-in guy at the Finance Department the other day and asked him what the Tories have done that's so wonderful. “The PR,” he responded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hard not to agree. It's been a great shell game. Their propaganda has masked a middling economic performance.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 DONALD FEHR / THE NEGOTIATOR</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Donald Fehr's previous employers, hits were the competitive coin of the realm. They can be career-ending for his new constituents in the National Hockey League Players' Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fehr, executive director of the NHLPA, is No. 1 on The Globe and Mail's Power 50 for 2012, because of the significance accorded negotiations on a new collective agreement with the National Hockey League, and because his reputation after leading the Major League Baseball Players Association for 23 years suggests NHL commissioner Gary Bettman might not want to assume any more that he is the brightest guy in the room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current collective agreement expires Sept. 15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Make no mistake, economic issues will dominate collective bargaining, with owners attempting to claw back more hockey-related revenue from the players. That, plus the need to restore integrity and unity to an organization that went through three leaders in five years, is why the NHLPA hired Fehr, a 63-year-old native of Prairie Village, Kan. It did not hire him to be a point man on concussions or formulate some big-picture response to what has become the defining issue for a generation of hockey players, whether or not they realize it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the former head of the baseball players' union, Fehr stood for privacy principles in fighting drug testing. Concussions present an issue that is not as clear-cut. Fehr's instinct is to follow his constituency's lead, and in an interview in the NHLPA's offices in Toronto last month, he made it clear he believes collective bargaining is only one area in which the issue can play out. His prescription is co-operation, through the NHL's concussion working group and the competition committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That shouldn't come as a surprise. Fehr sees his role as representative, as opposed to taking grand stands for public consumption, and professional athletes, regardless of sport, are a conservative group, unwilling to make what seem to be relatively logical changes – wearing helmets during pregame warm-ups, or visors or batting helmets with ear-flaps – because the existing system is the one they know best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That includes players who owe their position to their ability to inflict physical damage on opponents, something Fehr never had to deal with in the baseball players' union. “Different players view physical interaction differently, depending on experience, age and what their role is,” he explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not the only difference in constituencies. Fehr has found European hockey players, for example, tend not to be of one mind as much as Latin-American baseball players. Hockey players are also a younger group, and more likely to feel bulletproof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In public statements, Fehr has made the link between baseball's labour peace and the absence of a salary cap, suggesting to many that he will push for an overhauled system of revenue sharing and a luxury tax in the NHL. That will be a tough sell to owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What might be an easier sell – and this will come as a blow to a generation of hockey fans who have become used to NHL players in the Olympics – is the notion of a World Cup of hockey, modelled on the joint partnership that resulted in the World Baseball Classic. Fehr is a former member of the United States Olympic Committee, which has given him a respect for, and a wariness of, the International Olympic Committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“To the extent that we are able with the NHL to work out agreements that are consistent in the operation of the league that year, then that's great,” Fehr said. “I am not prepared to say that in all years and under all circumstances, it's something players should do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“One of the things I think would be really good would be for the NHLPA and NHL to agree to a long-term establishment of a World Cup type of tournament,” he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Fehr's time at the head of the baseball players, Major League Baseball's revenue grew to $6-billion (all currency U.S.) a year, and the average player salary increased to $3.24-million from $289,000. Fehr guided the players through a court-ordered settlement in which the players received a $280-million collusion deal from the owners. He was also at the helm for a players strike that killed the 1994 season and, of course, baseball's steroid scandal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College in Chicago, says Fehr's legacy in baseball is mixed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“On balance, it's very positive in terms of the work he did for the players,” Zimbalist said. “It's more complicated because of the steroid issue. He was stalwart making sure the players didn't have their privacy rights infringed upon, and there's a significant sentiment that he was too forceful in that issue, that he was too much of the traditional trade unionist, defending his workers under all circumstances, instead of looking out for the benefit of the game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But as a negotiator, there's not much you can say that is not superlative,” Zimbalist said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labour armageddon was predicted the moment Fehr took the NHLPA job, and with lockouts in the NFL and NBA in 2011, and the NHLPA's decision to shoot down realignment, there are those who believe the ground has already been salted. Rubbish, according to Fehr.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The labour climate in football and basketball was one in which management was bound and determined to get major concessions from their union and players, and they did,” Fehr said. “It's similar to what happened in hockey in 2004-2005 and, obviously, when that's the case it makes for difficult negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But I don't necessarily think that because something happened in football or basketball it means it will happen in hockey, or that because they got through everything great in baseball's recent negotiations – where they have no salary cap – that it's all going to happen here. The economics of the four sports are different, the issues are different and the things that players care about are not the same things.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zimbalist doesn't think working within the confines of a salary cap will be a strategic edge for Bettman or deputy commissioner Bill Daly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“First, Don's always willing to listen to people about things he's not fully expert in,” Zimbalist said. “Second, the salary cap in the NHL has a range of $16-million [salary cap and ceiling between lowest payroll and highest payroll teams], so it's not nearly as tight as the cap in football or basketball. You'll have exceptions and loopholes and my guess is you can look for Don to find every nook and cranny to crawl into. There's really a tremendous amount to bargain over.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zimbalist said Fehr's biggest challenge will be “understanding the real financial circumstances of the league, and getting the players the best deal within that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Whether or not you're in favour of salary caps, he had a position against them just like Marvin [Miller, Fehr's predecessor as head of the baseball players' union] had a position against them, and he held it,” Zimbalist said. “He was the only one to have a position and make it stand on the biggest issue of all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The results of these negotiations will be driven largely by those objective financial circumstances, but it will be on the more favourable side for the players because Fehr is there.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Bettman</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NHL commissioner would presumably improve hockey's image by outlawing dangerous head shots. His challenge is to convince owners, primarily those of U.S. franchises who connect ticket sales with violence, to take sterner action. On the labour front, Bettman goes into labour negotiations with owners lined up behind him. There are some blots on his résumé – the Phoenix Coyotes and Atlanta Thrashers, for two – but the owners aren't complaining publicly.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Charles Tator, Paul Echlin, Robert Cantu, Karen Johnston, Brian Benson, Michael Cusimano, Chris Nowinski, et al.) Concussion doctors have spurred the campaign to bring awareness of the traumatic effects of head injuries to athletes and the public. Massachusetts-based Cantu has published 28 books on neurology and sports medicine and, since 1986, has had a grade-rank system for concussions. Echlin launched an online library of concussion cases in 2011. Johnson, Tator and Cusimano, among Canada's top neurosurgeons, speak out regularly. Calgary-based Benson is a researcher and educator on concussions in the winter sport hotbed. Nowinski isn't a doctor, but the former World Wrestling Entertainment wrestler works with Boston University to persuade athletes to donate brains to science.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shawn Flannigan found out a week ago what happens when banks get more careful about lending money.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He received a letter from <span class="companylink">TD Canada Trust</span> telling him the interest rate on his unsecured line of credit will rise to 9.75 per cent from 6 per cent on April 2. “This is going to hurt people, especially in this economy,” said the resident of Peterborough, Ont. “Do they really need to make more money off our backs?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the banks facing some challenges right now, the answer to that question has to be yes. The federal government has urged banks to tighten their lending rules for mortgages and credit lines, and at the same time the economy has turned soft. Revenue gains are hard to come by in today's world, and that's where Mr. Flannigan comes into the picture. He'll be paying more to his bank, and so quite possibly will you in the months ahead through either higher rates or higher fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of some TD line of credit customers, they'll be paying quite a bit more. At a time when the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span>'s overnight rate is 1 per cent and the major banks' prime is 3 per cent, borrowing at 9.75 per cent seems like a blast from a distant past of much higher rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“At <span class="companylink">TD Canada Trust</span>, it is important to us to be able to provide a wide variety of products, services and features to suit a range of customer needs,” the bank says in explaining the rate change to clients. “In order to do this, we regularly review our accounts and sometimes, we adjust our pricing.” Note: I am posting the letter on my <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> personal finance page: tinyurl.com/6uhkyfj).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government's concern about bank lending has focused on mortgages and home-equity credit lines, which differ from unsecured credit lines in that you pledge your house as security on what you borrow. It's all about cutting risk – the risk that people will be swamped by debt when interest rates rise and the risk that the housing market will overheat and then fall sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Controlling risk is also behind TD's new line of credit pricing. TD spokeswoman Barbara Timmins wrote in an e-mail that it reflects a “risk-based” approach that factors in a clients' credit situation and relationship with the bank, specifically the amount borrowed and the investments held.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Changes do not apply to all customers,” she wrote. “For those customers experiencing a change, 60 per cent will see their rate go up and 40 per cent will see their rate go down.” Rate increases range from 0.5 to 3.75 per cent and decreases range from 0.5 to 3 per cent below current rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flannigan's experience shows you can be a good TD customer and still get whacked with a big rate increase. He and his wife have chequing and savings accounts with the bank, a Visa card and a car loan. Two of his sons have student lines of credit with the bank, and another son has a car loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I've had my line of credit for five years and I've paid my interest and never missed a payment, he said. “Getting that letter they sent, I blew a gasket.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even at the best of times, banks raise fees on their chequing and savings accounts. Recently, though, we've seen a wide variety of new and higher charges. A quick survey includes the introduction of a $260 fee at <span class="companylink">Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</span> to close down a home equity line of credit, and <span class="companylink">Bank of Nova Scotia</span>'s move to increase the fee for debits that go beyond the amount included in your monthly account charge. The cost will rise to $1 from 65 cents. (Scotiabank is also making changes that expand free banking for students and youth.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be alert for fee increases when reading your monthly account statements on paper or online. Let me be an example to you of what happens when you let your guard down. I set up an online savings account at President's Choice Financial back in fall 2009 with $20 in it. After paying a penny in interest each month going back a long while, PCF last month stuck me with a $20 dormant account fee that left a balance of 26 cents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fellow at PCF's call centre informed me that I couldn't just dump money in the account and leave it there. I thought that's what savings accounts are for, but what do I know?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TIGHTENING CREDIT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">TD Canada Trust</span> customer Shawn Flannigan recently was told the rate on his unsecured line of credit will rise April 2. Here are the details, compared with TD's rate on a home equity line of credit. Home equity credit lines are cheaper because they're secured by the client's home. Note: TD's current prime rate is 3 per cent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first year, they identified five women in shelters they could help. Since then, two more female dentists have joined the initiative. Last year, they took on seven cases among them. The goal is to get more dental specialists involved so that more patients can be treated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The only way to deal with the pain of losing him [her brother] was to do something profound. The pain is inconsolable,” Dr. Meisami explains calmly and dispassionately, as though diagnosing her own emotional state and prescribing something to ease the grief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seated on sofas and chairs around Dr. Meisami are her colleagues, who donate their services to the foundation. Several tell the stories of the women they have treated and the transformation that ensues. “Depression and anxiety issues can sometimes be solved by doing something as simple as fixing someone's teeth,” says Maureen Fenn, a family dentist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the patients are single mothers. “They put their children first, and they're on the back burner,” Dr. Meisami says. “We are all care providers,” she adds, looking to her colleagues. “There's something in all of us to want to take care of people and please others.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She points out that “these are women who because of their situation are not used to being looked after. But this says to them, ‘I matter. My needs are relevant.' It's empowering them to be confident again.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many get jobs. They enter into healthier relationships. “The face is the centre of the human being,” Dr. Meisami explains. “People assess you by how you look. And there's a stigma associated with someone who has teeth that are missing, discoloured or broken.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interest in women's issues comes from her background, growing up in Tehran, where she was born. “It's very matriarchal. My mother ruled the household,” she laughs. “Iranian culture admires women. It's not what you see on TV,” she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With her parents and brother, she immigrated to Toronto in 1983. “My brother at 16 would have been enlisted for the [Iran-Iraq] war. And so my parents quickly got us out.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her father, Iraj, now retired, was a gynecologist. “He always used to say to me, ‘You get to be a mother!' He knew how great that would be. In Iran, we have an expression that means, ‘Heaven lies beneath a mother's feet.'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her brother was sympathetic to women's causes. “He taught me all my feminist ideals,” she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In his teenage years, he saw the revolution in Iran in 1979. He was socially aware and such a compassionate person. He was deeply affected by seeing people in oppression.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time of his death, he had an 18-month-old daughter. “She will never have the chance to know him,” Dr. Meisami says, “which is why we wanted to do something. This is who your father was.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the female dentists and orthodontists who work with her – Dr. Fenn, Josie Marciello, Shiva Shadmand, Renu Varshney, Yasmin Mawji and Amelia Deliakis – knew her brother. But they also have an interest in promoting women's issues for professional reasons. “We're all in jobs that are dominated by men,” one says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While more and more women are studying dentistry in schools, there are still challenges for women in the field. “You're looked down upon as a female medical resident. You don't complain about menstrual cramps or anything like that. We all feel fortunate because we had supportive families,” Dr. Meisami says as the women nod in agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The foundation gets in-kind donations from suppliers of dental materials such as implants, but otherwise the doctors cover the costs of their services themselves. They are hoping to enlist the help of the Canadian Women's Foundation to identify abused women in need.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is no [government] program to help with dental needs for this forgotten group of women, many of whom fall easily into poverty when they're in abusive relationships,” Dr. Meisami notes, referring to typewritten notes to outline the statistics of violence against women in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On average, every six days a woman in Canada is killed by her intimate partner. On any given day, more than 3,000 women, along with 2,500 children, are living in an emergency shelter to escape domestic violence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever diligent and willing to help, Dr. Meisami ends the interview by handing over her notes. “So you have the spelling for everyone's name,” she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then she notices that my pen has been leaking on my hands. “All over your nice red nail polish,” she observes with both doctorly and feminine concern. “A little bit of alcohol will fix that, you know.”</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The talk of the town last week was the <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> initial public offering (IPO). Well, actually it was the filing of the paperwork for the IPO that will take place a few months from now. But between now and then, you'll be hearing a lot more about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No doubt your friends will be sharing links about it, polls will be asking if you want to become an investor, and there will be some pretty divided opinions. But there is some speculation that Mr. Zuckerberg, whose company helped redefine social interaction, might try to redefine the IPO process. Or maybe kick-start an idea that has never really taken off: offering a piece of the action directly to users. (Note: The IPO is only available in the United States, but once shares starts trading on the open market, Canadians will be able to buy and sell the stock.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob Pisani, a reporter with CNBC, notes in his blog that <span class="companylink">Boston Beer</span> offered shares of their IPO to customers in 1995 by including subscription coupons in six-packs of beer. Fill out the coupon, get some stock at the IPO price. It was wildly successful as they had to turn away two out of every three people who wanted in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fast-forward 17 years where many people bank and invest online routinely; offering users a slice of the pie directly is no longer a stretch of anyone's imagination. Besides, with Google+ (a competing social network) recently reaching 100 million users, investors would have a reason to stick with the incumbent and become great(er) ambassadors of the brand. They would have a vested interest in promoting <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> over Google+ or any other future competitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by that logic, investors who were also users would have to balance the right for privacy with a desire for profitability. And since <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> makes a lot of money by knowing as much as it can about you and monetizing that through selling targeted ads, in addition to taking a cut from third-party applications (think Farmville and <span class="companylink">Zynga</span>), as an investor you would applaud attempts to extract more information and money out of yourself and your friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a user, however, you may be less than thrilled. Any long-time <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> user has seen the rants about ever-changing privacy guidelines and policies. If you shared those notes or links on your timeline in the past, would you continue to do so if you were an investor? The tones are anti-<span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, but apparently not anti-<span class="companylink">Facebook</span> enough to get people to cancel their accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you forego owning the stock, do you think you would want to know if any of your friends were investors? Would that change how you view their opinions on privacy issues or invitations to get bitten by zombie mob lords?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine your children charging you to access pictures of your grandchildren. Okay, I got a bit carried away with that last line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while I don't think mixing business with pleasure is going to turn <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> into the anti-social network, it certainly changes things. Everyone's relationship status could simultaneously change to “It's complicated.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The magnificent convenience of electronic communication should not be ruined by the nuisance known as “spam”: the indiscriminate bombardment of people's e-mail inboxes. But the well-intentioned federal statute commonly known as Canada's anti-spam law overreaches, unduly hobbling electronic commerce, and potentially affecting many Canadian companies – including The Globe and Mail, in its interactions with readers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CASL became law in late 2010, and will probably come into force this year, but its regulations – which could add some welcome flexibility – have not been definitively settled.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The core of the act is a prohibition against sending a commercial electronic message, unless the addressee has already agreed to receive it – either explicitly, in writing, or implicitly. The act limits that implied consent; by far the most common form it could take would be “an existing business relationship,” such as a continuing contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Internet age, that is a very narrow criterion. Large numbers of people may frequently visit a website without having a contract – such as a paid subscription. In order to do business in the 21st century, companies legitimately want and need to engage and communicate back and forth with their customers and their potential customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acts of the U.S. Congress are often more drastic than their staid Canadian equivalents. CASL is an exception. Where the U.S. anti-spam law enables consumers to opt out of getting a company's message, the coming Canadian regime requires companies to send people a request for permission to send them e-mails. And the companies won't be allowed to ask that consent by e-mail; presumably, they will have to resort to the post office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the penalties can be huge: up to $1-million for an individual, and up to $10-million for a corporation – seemingly for each violation. All this adds to the already heavy regulatory burden on Canadian companies, putting them at a disadvantage to foreign spammers, the real culprits – who are untouched by CASL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the government's draft regulations offer little or no relief from this draconian scheme. The apparent hesitation to proclaim CASL in force may be encouraging. The Canadian economy would benefit from a more balanced, accommodating approach to the commerce of the future.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Poor, poor Demi Moore. There she is, on a trashy magazine cover, staring sorrowfully out at us, as if pleading from the gaunt recesses of her heart: Help me – I am so very desperate and alone.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moore is currently in treatment for “an eating disorder and addiction issues” at a Utah rehab centre, according to E! News, after a reaction to having smoked “something … similar to incense” Jan. 23 put her in hospital briefly for “exhaustion.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, she is thin, and, yes, smoking things like incense is worrisome. And while seeking help sounds like a plan, this publicity is the last thing the publicly pitied actress needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moore's “downward spiral” is currently ricocheting through the entertainment media. Of the Bambi-eyed, Lorelei-haired devil in red couture, Us Weekly magazine writes, “Wild parties with her daughter, chasing boys younger than Ashton. Terrified of growing old, Demi turns back to drugs and self-destructs.” Other mags have her “barely eating,” “tortured by insecurities,” even suicidal – “LIFE IN DANGER,” reads the headline in People.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The backstory here (at least in the tabloids) seems to be the sexual misconduct of Moore's much-younger husband Ashton Kutcher (who turns 34 Tuesday). The news created a huge scandal last fall – leading Moore to announce that she was ending the marriage because of “certain values and vows that I hold sacred.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But is losing Kutcher grounds for the actress's alleged breakdown? Or are commentators far and wide merely lining up to humiliate – in the terrible guise of concern – the woman who always seemed to have everything?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commentators on Moore (most likely hangers-on) have spoken at length about feeling “embarrassed” for her. A video of her filmed more than 25 years ago, kissing a playful 15-year-old boy, went viral last week, as if it spoke to some sad predilection on her part.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But observers quoted in tabloids are transparently self-serving. When Moore apparently gave some lucky nobody a free lap dance, a “source” called this “uncomfortable to watch.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another source, close to Kutcher, commiserates with him, saying, “She was not the person Ashton fell in love with any more,” citing her neediness and terror of aging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is her aging – the best Charlie's Angel on film will turn 50 this year – that lies at the root of all of this counterfeit distress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moore has often been characterized as being obsessed with looking young, yet her face doesn't look like her actress friends' swollen, filler-jacked faces, and her body, if toyed with a bit, is scrupulously maintained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is we who are obsessed with her age, with her freakishly young looks, blithe, wealthy life and, until recently, hot, younger husband.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hot in a himbo way. Is it so hard to understand why Demi Moore, who is, after all, a rich, beautiful movie star – just cherry-picks whomever she likes to replace him? Isn't Wilmer Valderamma (Ashton's co-star on That '70s Show) single?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the media drip toxic honey all over Moore – as if being 49 and single is a fatal, and unusually disfiguring illness – she is holed up in rehab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or is she plotting? When she and that other cad, Bruce Willis, split in 2000, she retreated to her Idaho ranch, raised her daughters, grew her hair long and dated the local talent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She came back six years later, looking better than ever, ran around in a tiny bikini, snagged Kutcher, did a bit more film work and relaxed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until Kutcher began flaunting his tawdry dalliances, Moore was best known as “Mrs. Kutcher” (her Twitter name) and as an political activist for exploited children and Kabbalah devotee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's likely a good thing she has had to step out of the new Linda Lovelace biopic (that she has been replaced, in the role of Gloria Steinem, by Sarah Jessica Parker speaks volumes about the film's artistic values).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moore will use her latest crisis to focus – to look in a mirror, or, as she so often does, put on a revealing bathing suit and photograph herself in the mirror.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like any number of great screen goddesses before her – Joan Crawford, let's say – she will, as Crawford did, mouth the word “Yes.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, she will say. I am almost 50 and stunning. I starred in Ghost and St. Elmo's Fire, A Few Good Men and Striptease. I am Vanity Fair's greatest odalisque.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I will rise again, and be better, still.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She will say these things as she uses a jewelled pair of manicure scissors to cut Kutcher's face out of her family pictures. And as she does this, the world will follow suit: In 20 years, he will be a Jeopardy! question, and so will she: This screen legend once married a man who played “Randy” in a film called New Year's Eve.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But officials at Westminster in search of good advice from Canada might be surprised – indeed, puzzled – to find that, some two decades after the deaths of the Meech and Charlottetown accords, no new generation of thinkers, practitioners and “stars” has yet emerged in Canada to lay claim to sure-footed stewardship of the question that has suffused most key debates over the Canadian project since Confederation.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Canada has progressed into this new century, the law schools have ceased to produce great young scholars of federalism, prime minister-chaired first ministers conferences no longer take place, and a new coterie of politicians has moved to the fore with precious little familiarity with, immersion in, and instinct for the Quebec question and its peculiar nuances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, on the Quebec question, there has been no passing of the torch or changing of the guard. In Quebec political circles, the repli sur soi is nearly perfect: The social imaginary abstracts brutally from the idea of a larger Canada. In Ottawa and other Canadian political capitals, professional and personal relationships with the next generation of important Quebec political actors and thinkers are perfunctory at best, and non-existent at worst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A combination of scar tissue from past battles and the supposition – self-fulfilling or not – that the old dances around the Quebec question can only issue in pain (for one or more sides) have led to an awkward conspiracy of silence in our national political discourse: Everyone knows that the Quebec question exists, and that it has a certain import, but no one wishes to discuss it openly or often. Of course, over time, people forget how to speak about the question altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's wrong with silence if it keeps the country together? Answer: problems of judgment and problems of system. Far from being certain about the wisdom of their silence on the Quebec question, new-generation political actors with no felt history on the issue, or deep friendships with “the other” to tap, will have great difficulty making proper policy assessments on matters of state ranging from national unity to immigration, regional development, language policy and institution-building. And on constitutional matters – Quebec-centred or not – political and intellectual virginity on the Quebec question can only result in incompetent weighing of the pros and cons relating to particular amendments. The consequences of such incompetence are notorious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The systems critique of this silence is as follows: Without Quebec in the mix, and notwithstanding the recent economic rise of the West, few policy initiatives of pan-Canadian scale and impact can be realized. In a complex federation with ever-complex, new-century issues, the pretension to each level of government living blissfully within its own solitude is, in the end, a recipe for Canadian stasis and underperformance vis-à-vis other more dynamic political units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Great projects require the dynamism of the whole, and Quebec, with its vast geography, demographic weight and unique vocation – has always been a key impulse in that whole. Indeed, in addition to the major Canadian policy achievements that have near-direct Québécois inspiration (bilingualism and the Charter, for example), it's the very instinct to engage in, and be master of, the Quebec question that has driven successive generations of political leaders to deliver results, by proxy, in analogous areas such as majority-minority relations, social policy and even foreign policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The antidote to an impoverished national politics is the deliberate fostering of a new generation of top thinkers and public practitioners that engages, head on, the Quebec question on its own terms. This generation must be identified (or must self-identify), and it must frame the Quebec question in a way that's true to the times and challenges before us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Brits – the Scots perhaps chief among them – and many other countries will be taking careful notes, and praying we have something interesting to say.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We speak, instead, of the playoff stretch drive that officially got under way with the cessation of all-star festivities and will last through April 7, 2012, when regular-season game No. 1,230 will be played in San Jose (Sharks versus Los Angeles Kings). All 30 teams are scheduled to play that Saturday, with 14 of them destined to play golf on Sunday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world collection of conspiracy theories is long – Napoleon's poisoning, John F. Kennedy's assassination, George W. Bush's hand in 9/11, the alien cover-up in Roswell, the Royal Family's role in the drug trade, Y2K, Hitler's old age in South America, global warming, Barack Obama's birth certificate, the moon landing taking place in Sudbury, Princess Diana's car crash, the fake Paul McCartney, car engines that run on water, Elvis sightings – and the hockey world is hardly immune to wild plots and thoughts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ottawa Senators, currently on a six-game slide that has fans biting their nails to the quick, are wondering if the league had it in for them by assigning the same referee, Dan O'Rourke, to three of four games during the skid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The O'Rourke Conspiracy got its start in a 2-1 Ottawa loss to the Anaheim Ducks, when the official refused to call a tripping penalty in the final minute because the dumped Ottawa player in question, Erik Karlsson, was a known “diver.” It was the first anyone in Ottawa had heard this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In subsequent games, Ottawa gets too many penalties, the other team gets too few, the other team gets an unfair penalty shot and the Senators lose a third-period goal to goalie interference that would have tied another game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obviously, there is a plot line here – or so the postgame radio show callers, even those not slurring their words, claim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senators, of course, are hardly the sole victims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadiens lose to the New Jersey Devils when Montreal forward Eric Cole is hooked off the puck and the game-winning goal is scored on the turnover. The league, of course, is anxious to see the Devils make the postseason so the revenues will offset the millions the league has been advancing the financially troubled franchise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kings score a final-second goal to beat the Columbus Blue Jackets and replays distinctly show that some hand has hit the pause button on the clock. The Kings, you see, are in a tight playoff race and need every possible point to ensure this vital broadcast market joins the Devils in the postseason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Canadian teams, everyone knows the league cannot bear the thought of insignificant small markets like Ottawa, Calgary and Edmonton, advancing deep into the playoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hard to believe in 1993, New York Islanders head coach Al Arbour was the one accusing the league of a conspiracy to ensure an all-Canadian final between Montreal and the Toronto Maple Leafs. “They've got their own rules,” Arbour claimed. “They seem to look the other way.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Vancouver Canucks can certainly relate to that. As the last Canadian team to reach the final, the Canucks lost the 2011 Stanley Cup to the Boston Bruins when the officials went back to calling games – or not calling them, if you prefer – as they had in the prelockout days of whistle-in-the-pocket hockey rodeo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides, everyone knows NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and Bruins owner Jeremy Jacobs are close friends. … And <span class="companylink">NHL</span> senior vice-president Colin Campbell's son, Gregory, plays for the Bruins. … And NBC needed an American-based team to stage a comeback if it was going to hold a hockey audience in June. …</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">See how it works?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter what happens to your team in the coming weeks, it will be because the league is engineering it all from the top.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if they deny it, that only proves it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mayor has one idea about transit, the chair of the Toronto Transit Commission another. City councillors are feuding among themselves. The TTC commissioners are split on the question. A bewildered public wonders who on earth is running this show.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If only we had an impartial, professional agency to settle disputes like these. An agency with a mandate to oversee transit planning in the Toronto region. An agency that could stand above the political fray, look decades into the future and decide what kind of transit we need.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, wait, we already have one. Metrolinx was set up in 2006 “to provide leadership in the co-ordination, planning, financing and development of an integrated, multi-modal transportation network.” But where is Metrolinx now, when its leadership is most needed?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As civil war broke out at City Hall on Monday over two very different visions of the city's transit future, the provincial government agency remained weirdly passive. Chief executive officer Bruce McCuaig won't say which vision he supports: Mayor Rob Ford's for a mostly underground crosstown line along Eglinton, or TTC chair Karen Stintz's plan to get a bigger bang for the transit buck by using more above-ground light rail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Mr. McCuaig summoned journalists to the Metrolinx headquarters on Bay Street to deliver a presentation, featuring 19 slides, to “provide information” and “restate principles.” On the one hand, it said, burying most of the Eglinton line would move more people, more quickly. On the other, putting most of the line in a tunnel would raise the cost from about $6.5-billion to about $8.2-billion, meaning that “limited provincial funding is available to other projects.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good to know – in fact, already known. This has been the nub of the argument for the past year. You might think that, instead of blandly restating the pros and cons, the agency in charge of regional transit might express an opinion on which project suits Toronto's needs best. The Eglinton line, after all, is to be owned by Metrolinx and paid for entirely with provincial funds. If it's their project, not the city's, then surely they should take a stand on what shape it takes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No such luck. “I'm not advocating for one direction or the other,” says Mr. McCuaig.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Slide 13, titled Going Forward, Metrolinx states that it is simply “seeking a single position” from city hall. “We remain committed to delivering transit” – good to know again – “but clarity is required.” In other words: You decide. Then we might make up our mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That kind of bureaucratic waffling is sadly typical for Metrolinx, the transit heavyweight that looks more and more like an empty suit. When Mr. Ford first declared he was ripping up the Transit City light-rail plan, Metrolinx and its parent, the provincial government, could simply have told him to buzz off. At the very least, it should have asked him to seek approval from city council, the city's sovereign democratic body, before throwing out years of planning and millions of dollars worth of work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead it held closed-door talks with the mayor's people and agreed to a whole new plan. Bowing to the Mr. Ford's blind prejudice against putting rails on city streets, no matter how wide, it said it would put the whole $8-billion of provincial funds into one buried line: Eglinton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past year, Metrolinx has been proceeding as if that were a done deal, ignoring rising opposition on city council and disregarding a clause in the memorandum of understanding between the city and the province that made it clear council had to approve the deal. Now things have gone off the rails, as Ms. Stintz has been warning Metrolinx and the mayor's office for months that they would.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A stubborn mayor got us in this mess, but a spineless transit agency didn't help.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm writing this on Monday. Now, Mondays scare some people. They get the heebie jeebies on a Sunday night just thinking about it. That's why a lot of Sunday-night TV is a comfort blanket of stuff to reassure viewers that everything is peachy in the world.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others are scared by getting older. Increasingly, it's a reasonable fear. It seems we'll all end up as working seventysomethings and dropping like flies before we see a penny of the pensions we paid into. Apparently when somebody told Our Glorious Leader about the cost of pensions, he screamed like a banshee and ran away to Switzerland in fright.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people are scared by spiders. Or birds. Or ghosts and goblins. The brother is known to be afraid of soup. Go figure. I read the other day that 19.2 million adult Americans have specific phobias. The dark, creepy-crawlies, that kind of thing. And if TV coverage of the Republican primaries is any guide, millions more are terrified of health care, public transport and people who speak French. Again, go figure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The River (ABC, CTV, 9 p.m.) is promoted as being totally terrifying. You are told that you'll be on the edge of your seat, white-knuckled and then, possibly run from the room bawling for your mom. From the ads it's pretty clear that some mysterious thingy that goes “whoooooosh!” will terrify you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not so. The show is no such thing. It's really about a nice family that needs some healing. It's about mom, dad and the kids being united as a happy family. Now, there's always the possibility that some viewers are terrified by shows about nice happy families. If that's the case, be forewarned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyhoo, here's the gist of the story – a famous TV explorer, Emmet Cole (Bruce Greenwood) goes missing on the Amazon while filming a show called The Undiscovered Country and his family wants to find him. Usually Emmet took the family along on his travels but this time he didn't. He's presumed dead when a signal from his missing boat is detected. His wife Tess (Leslie Hope) agrees to participate in a search as part of a documentary about the missing husband. Emmet's son Lincoln (Joe Anderson) reluctantly tags along too. Later, the daughter of Emmet's missing cameraman turns up to join the search.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You will not be surprised to learn that everybody keeps a secret and hides an agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we get in The River is a show within a show. Often what we're watching is either footage from Emmet's TV show or footage from the documentary being made about the search. This is meant to explain all the jerky camera work and choppy editing. We also get unsubtle commentary about television. “I'm the cameraman. I don't save people!” one character barks. Yeah. Take that, reality TV. In our face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moving along, Emmet's boat is located and weirdness ensues. Nature, it is revealed, is both lovely and threatening. The viewer reels, no doubt. Next thing you know, there's some badass force upsetting people by making “whoooosh” noises accompanied by a throbbing beat on the soundtrack. Some characters stand around and talk about “the thing,” “the ghost,” “the soul,” “an angry soul” and before you can shout at the screen, “it's a hobgoblin, a hobgoblin, I tell you!” somebody else is yakking in about “a shaman.” Jiminy, do ya think there's something mystical going on, or what?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in The River we are shown clips from Emmet's famous and family-friendly TV show. His catchphrase was “There's magic out there!” At the end, a certain person in his family says, wait for it, “There's magic out there!” On this basis we are meant to tune in for all eight episodes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's odd about The River is that there is scariness in the premise, but not in the execution. The blame can be put on one Steven Spielberg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show was created by Oren Peli, the writer-director of the indie movie Paranormal Activity, which was genuinely chilling, done in a more authentic verité style than The River, and grossed almost $200-million (U.S.) worldwide. He pitched the idea for this TV series and Spielberg liked it and backed it. (The River is made by Spielberg's production company.) In interviews, Peli has spoken about Spielberg's enthusiasm – “At one point, he says, ‘You know, we should really do a TV show together. There's nothing like this, something very raw and visceral, on TV.' ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there's the rub. Almost every Spielberg production is about a family and family unity. In his movies Spielberg is obsessed with uniting families and creating the idyllic dynamics of the perfect American home. Starting with Sugarland Express in 1974 – the story of a couple who lost custody of their child while in prison and want him back – so many Spielberg films are about the glory of family and the urge to create, re-create or heal a solid family unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus The River is neither scary nor macabre in any way. It might best be re-titled, Finding Dad.</p>

According to a recent Angus Reid poll, 66 per cent of women think there should be laws governing whether a women can abort a fetus solely because of gender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem isn't going away. Sex selection is practised in both India and China, two of Canada's biggest sources of immigrants. Cheap and portable ultrasound technology is now available everywhere. In Punjab, one of the most prosperous areas of India, the ratio of baby boys to baby girls has reached 120 to 100. (A normal birth ratio is 103 to 107, nature's way of compensating for higher boys' mortality.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's unlikely that more education and development will be the answer because, in India, sex selection is more popular among the affluent. Gendercide is also on the rise in China, where the ratio of boys to girls increased to 119 by 2004. (In some regions, it's more than 150.) Leading demographer Nicholas Eberstadt calls the rising tide of sex selection “a global war against baby girls.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada, of course, gender-based abortion is completely legal. University of British Columbia economist Kevin Milligan, working with Douglas Almond and Lena Edlund of Columbia University, used census data to determine its patterns among immigrant groups. They published their findings in a 2009 paper, Son Preference and the Persistence of Culture. Although they didn't try to put numbers to their findings, the data clearly show that sex selection is culturally specific and persists into the second generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most revealing evidence of boy preference shows up with the third-born children of parents who had two girls first, Prof. Milligan says. The ratio of boys to girls among third-born children (when the first two were girls) was 139 among families of Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese origin. For families from India, it was 190. For Sikhs, it was more than 200 – in other words, the third child was more than twice as likely to be a boy than a girl. The data show that son preference is just as strong among second-generation immigrants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, the study found that families from the Philippines (which is largely Catholic) have normal sex ratios. So do Canadian families here a few generations. Christians and Muslims, whose religions have strong prohibitions against infanticide, also have normal sex ratios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When consulted on this issue, medical ethicists tend to say that family planning is nobody's business, and that the rest of us should butt out. Maybe that's the price we've got to pay for not reopening the abortion debate. But it's ironic that the hard-won right of women to control their reproductive futures has become a weapon for the ultimate discrimination against girls. And I'm afraid this is just the start. Some day soon, our marvellous new technologies will let us know not just the gender of our fetus but also her IQ and nose size. As tough as they are now, our moral dilemmas are about to get a whole lot worse.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My goodness but Krista Erickson of Sun News has a lot of middle-aged male apostles.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By “a lot” I actually mean a handful, but they are noisy media types – pundits who are online and barking, sniping at her detractors and rising to her defence with alacrity. Justin Bieber could only dream of such ardent Internet warriors launching scathing attacks on persons unmoved by his alleged charisma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At issue is the decision, released on Monday, by the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council in relation to complaints that Erickson mistreated Canadian dancer Margie Gillis during a notorious interview broadcast on Sun News last year. Erickson hectored Gillis about public funding for the arts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CBSC received 6,676 complaints about the interview from people who took the view that Gillis had been treated most unfairly. The council usually gets about 2,000 complaints in an entire year. It concluded that, in the interview, there was no violation of the agreed standards of ethics. Erickson was aggressive but had licence to act in this manner and Gillis had the opportunity to articulate her views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am exhorted by Krista Erickson's apostles to report that she has been “cleared” by the CBSC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right on. Nobody should be surprised that the CBSC failed to find fault in Erickson's approach. She was obnoxious. There is no regulatory mechanism for the censure of obnoxious behaviour on TV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who felt they could gain justice for Margie Gillis were naive. The obnoxious have triumphed on TV here. If being obnoxious was a disqualification, then Don Cherry and Kevin O'Leary would have disappeared from the airwaves many years ago. They didn't. They prevailed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insult comedy, a genre so elastic that it includes the livid hatred of Andrew Dice Clay's act and the much more benign slap-downs of Bernie Mac, gave way to insult coverage of politics on TV and any issue considered vaguely political. In the United States, the style of Fox News is rooted entirely in the tactic of insulting those who disagree with the views of its right-wing pundits, reporters and anchors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tactic, copied with gusto on Sun News, is an insult to the intelligence, but it does not diminish its popularity among those whose oxygen is resentment. That is, resentment of the poor, the unionized, the altruistic, the charitable and, in the case of Erickson's attacks on Margie Gillis, the talented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a fact that Erickson and her colleagues at Sun News have a tiny audience and no method of obtaining impact except by being all big-mouth obnoxious to people such as Margie Gillis. They are squirts shouting insults at people of substantial achievement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is also a fact that exhortations to publicize the CBSC decision come when Sun News is in desperate need of distraction from the revelation last week of a bogus citizenship ceremony that aired on the channel. The laughter aimed at Sun News stung (rightly so), and the upshot is hope that brave Krista Erickson's triumph with the CBSC decision will save the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her passel of middle-aged male apostles hope so. Presumably they number among the 49 people who “like” the Krista Erickson page on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. It's strikes me that “49” is a rather sad number for a TV personality of such alleged fame and impact. But Canadian fame is a strange kind of fame, isn't it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You know, blaming television for the triumph of the obnoxious is as foolhardy as expecting a regulatory body to condemn obnoxious behaviour. The rise of insult coverage of political and social issues on TV paralleled the rise of social media such as <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and Twitter, universes that thrive on narcissism and nastiness. But users, not the medium, establish that tone. Just as preening pundits throwing insults can find an audience only if somebody watches and encourages them on TV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are apostles of the obnoxious out there, noisily tweeting and braying. Margie Gillis isn't. She doesn't need to, and her apostles know that, no matter what the CBSC decision says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wine &amp; Spirits inbox has swelled in recent weeks with enticements from alcohol merchants attempting to leverage Valentine's Day to drive sales. There are many ways to say I love you, but apparently just as many to say, “I want to get you drunk.” Pink wines for your Valentine, neon cocktails for your radiant love, icewine for chocolate – that sort of thing. Funny, it's the day of passion and seductive dining, and all I get is cold spam.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the suggestions are a bit of stretch, I might add. As in: Brunello di Montalcino (it ages gracefully, like your relationship); cabernet sauvignon (chock full of aphrodisiac notes like “plum, warm spice and vanilla”). One brand of low-calorie flavoured vodka is plugging “skinny” cocktails for the big day. To which I might add: Is there a less-romantic message than implying that your Valentine could stand to shed a few pounds?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But enough cynicism. You're in love, or hope to be. Far be it from me to pour ice water on the day of wine and roses. As many of you will be dining out rather than looking for bottles to lavish as gifts, I have several suggestions on that score. And I guarantee these meditations come straight from the heart, not the promotional literature of any alcohol purveyor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pink aperitifs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The colour is a Valentine cliché, but I happen to like many pink drinks. There are ways to work with the hue while steering clear of cloying neon cocktails. <span class="companylink">Campari</span> and soda is a splendid start to a meal. Bitter-sweet, glowing-red <span class="companylink">Campari</span> liqueur from Italy stimulates the palate while channelling your inner Latin lover. Aperol, a pink-orange aperitivo, is similarly glorious with soda or on the rocks with an orange slice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Champagne</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter how perfunctory the occasion can be for a marriage with mileage, consider ordering a glass, if not a bottle. Luxe bubbles might even manage to distract you from the fact you're missing Glee on Fox at 8 p.m. It need not be true-blue Champagne, just good stuff, such as Segura Viudas from Spain, Sumac Ridge Steller's Jay from British Columbia, Henry of Pelham Cuvée Catharine from Niagara or any “cremant” from France. Order it before the meal, not with dessert, a fatal collision for dry sparkling wine. At home, you might want to infuse it with half an ounce of sweet cassis liqueur for a kir royale cocktail. If mixed properly, the shade will match the cheeks on Caravaggio's depiction of Cupid in Amor Vincit Omnia. Translation: love conquers all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beaujolais</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think of France's light, fruity red as a white wine in disguise. Based on the crisp, low-tannin gamay grape, it pairs reasonably well with fish as well as many vegetarian and meat courses. The last thing you want on Feb. 14 is a sparring match over the wine list should your Valentine order salmon while you opt for steak. Best of all (and this could be your personal secret), Beaujolais is the great unsung bargain on any wine list. Ask for a 2009, if available; it was a superb vintage. The sommelier will commend your discernment, and this is the day you want that to happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chardonnay</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The popular white wine tends to go by other identities in France, where vineyard location takes precedence over grape names. The most relevant alias for Feb. 14 is Chablis, a district of Burgundy that specializes in crisp, mineral-laden chardonnays ideal for raw oysters. Lean muscadet, made from the melon de Bourgogne grape near the French oyster capital of Brittany, is the bargain alternative. Fuller-bodied, buttery New World chardonnays can be romantic, too, if deftly paired with popcorn and a stay-in movie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your best video options: Before Sunrise or its equally good sequel, Before Sunset, starring Ethan Hawke and French lovely Julie Delpy. If any movie can, either of these one-day-love-affair gems will convert your Neanderthal tough guy into a Kleenex-hogging hugmuffin, especially after enough chardonnay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cognac or Armagnac</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">France's two great brandies trump all other post-prandial drinks in the sophistication department. For chocolate, the tongue-tingling oak supplies a better counterpoint, I think, than sweet wine, whose fruitiness and sugar can steal the show. (No bona fide chocolate lover wants that fate to befall the almighty cocoa bean.) Warm, velvety and brimming with richer aphrodisiac notes of spice and vanilla than most cabernets, good brandy will put natural blush in your cheeks after the fake stuff wears off by evening's end. Plus, brandy snifters are less precarious in the bedroom than wine stemware.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of Dalton McGuinty's Liberals have taken pleasure in watching Karen Stintz stand up to Rob Ford. To Toronto MPPs, in particular, it looks like a bully – one who once threatened their own re-election prospects – getting his comeuppance.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if Mr. Ford's own transit chief succeeds in derailing his subway plans, the Ontario Premier might feel compelled to help the mayor save a little face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's provincial dollars that are supposed to fund new transit lines in Toronto, and the Liberals will start feeling heat if there's more stalling in building them. So while Mr. McGuinty has tried diligently (some would say too much so) to stay out of the civil war at city hall, all signs point to provincial officials attempting to engineer some sort of compromise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Ms. Stintz's motion before council passes on Wednesday, ostensibly resurrecting Transit City, some Liberals will argue that Mr. McGuinty should simply sign back on to David Miller's old plan for above-ground light-rail lines. The dominant view at Queen's Park, though, seems to be that moving forward with that model would be untenable as long as the mayor is vehemently opposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It remains to be seen if Mr. Ford will sign on to anything other than the below-ground plan that he campaigned on. After all, the blowup with Ms. Stintz occurred because he was unwilling to accept the hybrid that she proposed, which would have seen portions of the new Eglinton light-rail line built above ground to free up money for other development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if Ms. Stintz proves she has both the guts and the votes to scupper the mayor's plans entirely, a middle ground could look more inviting. And the province could make it all the more so by threatening to pull back some of its $8.4-billion commitment if the city can't get its act together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's increasing speculation about whether that's become Mr. McGuinty's most enticing option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liberals insist otherwise, and having already scaled back their original commitment in the final year of Mr. Miller's reign, they seem reluctant to further invite backlash. Instead, their ideal scenario seems to be saving money by not burying the entire Eglinton line, then resurrecting plans for a new above-ground line on Finch Avenue West – a development they reluctantly abandoned last year, when Mr. Ford seemed to hold all the cards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In return, the Liberals could maintain their promise to put up to $650-million toward the extension of the Sheppard subway line, once Mr. Ford showed he'd secured enough other funding, as opposed to the light-rail line there that Mr. Miller had championed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Russian democratic opposition leader Boris Nemtsov woke up on Feb. 4 and saw that the outside temperature in Moscow was minus 22 degrees, he was worried. Mr. Nemtsov had put great store in the planned demonstration against Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Moscow's Bolotnaya Square that day. But, given the extreme cold, he figured only 10,000 to 15,000 people (a much smaller number than at the protests in December) would show up. “Thank God that I was seriously mistaken,” Mr. Nemtsov wrote in a blog. “Muscovites turned out to be more decisive, stronger and more determined than I thought.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimates on the numbers depend on whether the source is the police or the organizers, but it is safe to say the turnout for the protest was well over 50,000. And, by all accounts, the crowd was in a buoyant mood. According to one participant, the acclaimed Russian writer Lyudmila Ulitskaya: “In Russia it is customary for people to be afraid of the regime. … Now the time has come when people laugh at the regime … this laughter on the street is a very dangerous sign for the political authority.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the growing public discontent, it is still likely that Mr. Putin, as the candidate put forth by the pro-Kremlin United Russia Party, will manage to get the slim majority he needs to win the presidential election on March 4. If Mr. Putin were not to get over 50 per cent of the vote, there would be a runoff with the second ranking of the four other candidates on March 25. This is a scenario the Kremlin wants desperately to avoid, so it has pulled out all the stops to ensure Mr. Putin's victory in the first round. Recently, for example, the Central Election Committee ruled that Grigory Yavlinsky, the presidential candidate for the democratic party Yabloko, could not be on the ballot because he did not have enough valid signatures to be registered. And on the day of the Bolotnaya protests, Russian authorities staged a huge rally in support of Mr. Putin, reportedly paying people to attend, giving state workers the day off and even threatening some with sanctions if they did not show up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the Kremlin could always resort to tampering with the ballot boxes. But such efforts could backfire given the public outcry over what was seen as widespread fraud in the December Duma elections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the Kremlin's concerns about the March election, the real problem for Mr. Putin will be to hold on to the presidency in the longer term. He has thus far managed to maintain public support by providing economic benefits to rank-and-file Russians (thanks to high oil prices) and by convincing people that they need a strong leader, rather than a democratic one, to preserve Russia's stability. Mr. Putin and his supporters have also played on the pervasive anti-Western sentiment in Russia, accusing the democratic opposition of being funded by the U.S. government. But an economic downturn in Russia, coupled with continued protest demonstrations, could chip away at Mr. Putin's support, especially given the general public awareness of pervasive corruption in the Kremlin elite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to the protests, Mr. Putin has lately been saying that he recognizes the need for economic and political change. Yet if Mr. Putin is truly advocating change, it is illogical that he, the undisputed ruler of Russia for 12 years, would be asking the Russian people to elect him for a third, six-year presidential term. As Russian journalist Nikolay Svanidze wrote this week: “Tackling the issues that have been haunting Russia's political system and institutions would largely require a critical reform, if not a demolition of the very system of governance that Mr. Putin himself has created.”</p>

That would discourage companies from investing in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The closing – after a lockout – of Electro-Motive Diesel Inc. in London, by its owner, <span class="companylink">Caterpillar Inc</span>., which bought it in June, 2010, was the occasion for Mr. McGuinty's statement on Monday. “If your intention is merely to buy an Ontario business so you can shut it down and strip out the jobs and the intellectual property,” he said, “that's not on.” He directly attributed such an intention to <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span>: “This company, we have learned, had no sincere interests in a long-term presence in that community.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it happens, Electro-Motive Diesel Inc. has always been a subsidiary of American corporations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real trouble with the Investment Canada Act was seen in the federal government's finding, in November, 2010, that the proposed purchase of <span class="companylink">Potash Corp</span>. by <span class="companylink">BHP Billiton Ltd</span>. was not of “net benefit” to Canada, in the midst of many claims that the potash deposits of Saskatchewan were a strategic Canadian asset – a phrase absent from the ICA. That led to an uncertainty about Canada in the international investment world, which needs clarification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McGuinty seems to think the ICA should routinely require foreign applicants for takeovers to commit themselves to stay in business for some fixed term – come what may.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 2007, Canada set some such conditions on the takeover of <span class="companylink">Stelco Inc</span>. by <span class="companylink">United States Steel Corp</span>. It proved hard to comply with these in changing economic circumstances. Though the federal government was right to sue <span class="companylink">U.S. Steel</span> for breaking its promise, it was also right to eventually settle the dispute, in December, 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loss of 450 jobs at EMD, in a region that has already lost many manufacturing jobs, is tragic. But the changes that Mr. McGuinty wants to the ICA are not viable. A government agency in Ottawa cannot impose business judgments on real businesses.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Canada's ambassador to the United Nations from 2000 to 2004, I had a front-row seat for the march to war in Iraq. Now the target is Iran, and I have the sinking feeling I've seen this movie before. The ending isn't happy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2003, I saw Americans adding exclamation points to intelligence assessments where question marks were appropriate. Now, the most dire possible interpretation is made of an International Atomic Energy Agency report on Iran's activities. Israeli deputy prime minister Moshe Yaalon has even claimed that Iran is producing a 10,000-kilometre-range missile capable of reaching the United States. Shades of Tony Blair's dodgy dossier!</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pentagon argued in 2003 that a war in Iraq would have to be launched by March, before the hot weather made fighting impossible. Now, Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak asserts that “Iran's nuclear program is … about to enter an ‘immunity zone' ” after which military action would be unavailing. Although Israeli intelligence leaders are openly skeptical of the idea's wisdom, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made no secret of his interest in an attack on Iran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in the day, Mr. Harper wrote to The Wall Street Journal that the Liberal government's decision to stay out of the Iraq war was a “serious mistake” and that disarming Iraq was “necessary for the long-term security of the world.” Now, he has said it is “beyond dispute” that a goal of the Iranian nuclear program is “the development of nuclear weapons,” and that the Iranian world view means they would have “no hesitation” to use them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The IAEA does have “serious concerns about possible military dimensions” to Iran's nuclear program, but it does not say it believes Iran has a nuclear weapon. In his 2011 Threat Assessment, U.S. National Intelligence Director James Clapper said, “We continue to assess Iran is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons … should it choose to do so.” Defence Secretary Leon Panetta recently said the Iranians are not building a nuclear weapon, but rather a capability to build one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iran has repressed its own people, suppressed democracy, threatened Israel, sponsored terrorism and evaded the crucial UN Non-Proliferation Treaty. The question is not whether its policies should be opposed, but the most effective way to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is different now from back then is that the U.S. administration does not want war. Mr. Panetta has reportedly, surprisingly, forecast an Israeli attack in the spring, possibly deliberately giving the game away. Although the U.S. commitment to Israeli security is said to be rock-solid, the extent to which that guarantee would be exercised would depend on Israeli actions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iran is capable of directly attacking Western military forces in the Persian Gulf and Afghanistan, and of using proxies like Hezbollah and Hamas. It could impede the shipment of the 40 per cent of the world's oil that transits the Strait of Hormuz, causing prices to spike and damaging Western economies. At the UN, Russia and China would likely veto any military action and might even come to Iran's aid. And another Western attack on a Muslim state would likely trigger further Islamist extremism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps Israel's sabre-rattling is designed to force the pace on sanctions. Perhaps it is meant seriously. Our government should explain to Canadians whether its increasingly common characterization of Israel as an ally is purely for domestic political consumption or intended to have actual military consequences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acquiescing in Iranian development of a nuclear bomb is hardly palatable, either. A nuclear-armed Iran would be free from attack, allowing it to dominate its neighbours, foment terrorism and export religious extremism, while triggering a regional nuclear arms race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Israel, the United States and the like-minded have two choices: To bomb Iran in the hope of destroying its nuclear capability and weather the negative international reaction, or to persevere with sanctions, diplomacy and deterrence. Deterrence has long been the operating principle governing relations between the West and the Soviet Union, the United States and China, and Pakistan and India. And while no one can guarantee the Israelis that a nuclear Iran would not attack Israel or hand weapons to third parties, doing so would be suicidal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We should not allow ourselves to be stampeded into supporting a war on arbitrary timelines and hyped intelligence. Those who cannot remember history are condemned to repeat it.</p>
