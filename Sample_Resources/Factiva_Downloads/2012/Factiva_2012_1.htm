<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Author and past president of two Canadian liberal arts universities</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the new year begins and humanities and social science undergraduates across Canada return to campus, they will face the usual robust combination of academic pressure, parental anxiety over their future employability, nervousness over mounting debts and the inevitable recitation of that tired and toxic mantra: “How many sociologists do we need, anyway?”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They will have been steeled to face the scrutiny of their professors and the apprehension of their parents. However, the incomprehension and parochialism of the commentators, policy wonks and self-labelled enlightened pragmatists who call into question the validity of their studies is both dispiriting and frustrating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unpersuaded by the compelling philosophical and social arguments that undergird the continuing relevance of a liberal arts education, and determined to place utility and rationalization of services as the premier determinants of higher education, the critics can easily assail the productivity value of a traditional liberal arts education. They simply point to economic data that shore up theirs as the only common-sense position in a time of global upheaval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, reading Schopenhauer, exploring the relationship between Freud and Jung, studying patterns of exile in the new breed of Canadian novelist or probing the sublime beauty of a late Beethoven piano quartet are nice, but indulgent – a waste of taxpayers' money and a dereliction of responsibility at a time when the economic engine requires nothing higher than entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But here's an idea: a social sciences and humanities education as corrective to political tyranny.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent deaths of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and former Czech president Vaclav Havel provide an arresting example of the formative power of education. Mr. Kim and Mr. Havel were dramatic contrasts in style of governance, liberality of mind and openness to new thinking, but they can also serve as case studies of the myopic and deadening education of the technocrat as opposed to the expansive and liberating education of the playwright-essayist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Admittedly, being a technocrat is not a bad thing; the governments of Greece and Italy have replaced their respective prime ministers, George Papandreou and Silvio Berlusconi, with technocrats Lucas Papademos and Mario Monti. But the latter are economists and not party functionaries like Mr. Kim, who was adept enough to charm former U.S. secretary of state Madeleine Albright and others with a self-deprecating manner and a familiarity with pop culture, all the while remaining a dangerous political fantasist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A liberal arts education is not an automatic guarantor of an emancipated intellect or an enlightened sensibility. You have to work at it. In fact, Mr. Havel was prevented from studying the humanities at university for political reasons, an early indicator for him that the authorities appreciated the subversive potential of such an education. But the capacity of a writer and political thinker like Mr. Havel to usher in a new and bloodless era by symbolizing the conscience of freedom-enamoured Czechs would be unthinkable were it not for his exposure to a tradition of learning that is not subservient to a prevailing political ideology, that is deeply humanist in its core, steeped in the writings of extraterritorial thinkers not held hostage to the orthodoxy of the moment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North Korea's Dear Leader may have been an obsessive devotee of Hollywood B movies, thereby giving him a mite of aesthetic relief from the grey madness of Pyongyang, but Mr. Havel brought down an oppressive system through his art and witness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, when next a young sociology undergraduate is critiqued in the manner of Peter Shaffer's Austrian emperor in Amadeus, who observes to a puzzled Mozart that his just-debuted work has “too many notes,” the student might respond that there are as many sociologists as it takes to keep us free.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada paved its first highway, from Toronto to Hamilton, a century ago. Film footage shows gangs of workers dumping wheelbarrows filled with gravel or cement onto the roadbed, then, on their knees, working elbow to elbow, using trowels to make a smooth and level surface. <span class="companylink">Google</span> “First Paved Highway 1912” for a two-minute documentary glimpse of this historic event. You can count 20 or 30 workers in a single gang, showing why this kind of shovel-ready work became such a favourite of governments. In the beginning, at any rate, paving roads employed a lot of people.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada now has something approaching 900,000 kilometres of paved roads, the United States 6.4 million kilometres – taken together, a vast expanse of heat-absorbing surfaces. Yes, road building has changed. Work crews are smaller, paving machines bigger; and highways are faster and safer than ever. But highways fill essentially the same single, simple function they filled a hundred years ago – roads without bumps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This could soon change. This year, U.S. inventor Scott Brusaw will build a small prototype of the world's first solar-powered, electronically controlled, glass-surfaced highway on a parking lot near his lab in the small community of Sagle, Idaho.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. government will fund the experiment, which will cost a mere $750,000 – less than the cost of paving one kilometre of road. Mr. Brusaw, an electrical engineer, will seek to demonstrate that his smart solar road panels have the capacity to convert the U.S. highway system (and, by extension, Canada's) into a huge power generator theoretically capable of producing three times as much electricity as the U.S. now consumes – and almost as much as the entire world now consumes. By Mr. Brusaw's calculations, this highway-based power generator would produce so much electricity that highways could be heated, all winter long, to 40 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could solar-powered highways really mean an end to snowplows and icy roads? Mr. Brusaw says they could. He cites the rear window in cars: A glass plate is embedded with a heating element that can “crank up to 85 degrees Fahrenheit” to clear the window of snow or ice. His solar-heated highway would be permanently heating (during winter months) at 40 degrees Fahrenheit. meaning snow wouldn't accumulate in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brusaw's solar panels measure 12 feet by 36 feet. Mimicking the rear window in a car, the surface level is made of translucent glass, textured for traction. (Glass is 75-per-cent sand, a common enough raw material.) Beneath the surface are heating elements and an array of LEDs, light devices that move electronic data and activate sensors. At the bottom of the panel, a “base plate” distributes power as required – to the road-surface information systems, to the pavement-warming systems and to transfer of surplus electricity energy storage tanks and to the continental grid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the motorist, the sensor devices inside the glass panel would “paint” illuminated lane-passing lines to guide traffic and would “print” warning messages – stop, slow down – on the roadway ahead as conditions required. The messages would be calculated and confirmed every 12 feet of distance travelled. This isn't as improbable as it sounds. IBM has already shown the use of roadway sensors to deliver road-condition reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on an assumption of only four hours of sunlight a day, and only 15 per cent efficiency in the capture of solar energy, Mr. Brusaw says a continental installation of smart roadway panels would generate enough electricity to power the U.S. 24 hours a day. Much of the country's highway system is massed on the East Coast and the West Coast. Thus the “lit” (day) portion of the continent would generate enough excess electricity to power the “dark” (night) part.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brusaw's vision is intriguing. The technical credibility of the concept itself has been demonstrated. The 2012 prototype will assess the economics of “commercializing” it. Mr. Brusaw thinks a solar-powered kilometre of highway could pay for itself in six years – but, deeply in debt, governments can't afford the up-front investment. Governments will need to take highways private – or quasi-private – to produce super-smart, solar-powered roadways. The real barrier, after all, is neither scientific nor financial. It's institutional – and, lamentably, ideological.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hawkeye State accounts for a mere 28 of the almost 2,300 delegates who will anoint a Republican presidential candidate at the national convention in August. Yet the 100,000 or so Iowans expected to turn out for Tuesday's GOP caucuses could make or break the candidacies of several of those vying for the nomination.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk about a power trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The direction the Republican race takes after Iowa is directly influenced not only by who wins the caucuses, but by who does not. How the candidates place will determine who has the momentum heading into the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries later this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's what to look for on Tuesday night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is the Santorum surge for real?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rick Santorum, who lost his Pennsylvania Senate seat in 2006, was never supposed to be a contender. But without the money or staff for a national campaign, he was forced to spend nearly all of 2011 in Iowa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is now paying off. Evangelical Christians made up more than half of Republican caucus-goers in 2008, when former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee ran away with Iowa. If they turn out again on Tuesday, Mr. Santorum could be the surprise winner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fiercely anti-abortion and anti-gay marriage, he is the only candidate to experience a last minute surge in the polls. Mr. Santorum has two major shortcomings, however. First, he is no Mr. Huckabee, whose warmth made him instantly likeable. Second, his Senate loss remains a reflection of just how much he alienates mainstream voters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he has become a better politician since then. He showed that on Sunday's Meet the Press, with this clever comeback: “Who goes from losing their last Senate race to winning the presidential nomination? The answer to that was Abraham Lincoln.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can Romney hold on?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitt Romney has spent the entire campaign playing down expectations for Iowa, where his 2008 bid for the nomination met its effective Waterloo. But with polls now showing the ex-Massachusetts governor in first place in the state, he must perform extremely well on Tuesday or face growing concerns that anti-Romney sentiment in the party is too strong for him to overcome. That would damage his chances in South Carolina and Florida and possibly resuscitate the candidacies of Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consensus viewpoint is that Mr. Romney does not need to win Iowa. But he must place at least a strong second or be among a cluster of candidates at the top. With at least 40 per cent of likely caucus goers saying they could change their minds by Tuesday, Mr. Romney will need to rely on recruiting supporters to twist the arms of fellow voters when Iowans caucus in almost 1,800 precincts on Tuesday night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will independents choose Paul?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democrats are also caucusing on Tuesday night. But with President Barack Obama not facing a challenger, it frees up thousands of independent voters to participate in the Republican caucuses this year. Voters can change their party registration right up until the last minute in order to join in the GOP discussion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, libertarian candidate Ron Paul is counting on thousands of unaffiliated voters, especially college students, to propel him to the top.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A week ago, it looked like the Texas congressman might just get his wish. But he has been losing momentum in recent days as he faces attacks from the other candidates about his isolationist foreign policy and electability in a national race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will Iowa be the end of the road for Perry and Gingrich?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas Governor Rick Perry and former House of Representatives speaker Newt Gingrich both need to exceed expectations in Iowa to have much hope of mounting a comeback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Perry, a failure to rally more than 10 per cent of caucus-goers would likely spell the end. A score of 15 per cent or more would signal that enough Republicans are willing to give him a second look as the search for an anti-Romney continues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Perry, who raised nearly as much money as Mr. Romney while he led the field last summer, has the war chest to carry on. Iowa will determine whether he has the support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Mr. Gingrich, he has been in such a freefall in recent days that any result below 15 per cent would make it hard for him to become a contender again – though he has insisted he is staking everything on a win in South Carolina.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will Michele Bachmann call it quits?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Minnesota congresswoman has lurched from one gaffe to another since winning last summer's Ames Straw Poll, an early test of strength in Iowa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She blew her comeback chances in September, when after deftly skewering Mr. Perry over his Big Brother-like effort to force adolescent girls in Texas to get the HPV vaccine, she went on to suggest a link between the shot and “mental retardation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She wasted her last days in Iowa accusing her former state campaign chairman, who jumped ship to Mr. Paul, of making the switch for money. She has gone through staff like paper towels, raising questions about her temperament.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is, however, stubborn. As long as she remains in the race, she will able to count on a core of die-hard supporters. That, too, would help Mr. Romney in the long run.</p>

This is to be applauded, particularly as it will yield better access to good Canadian wine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though hard to believe, Canada has a Prohibition-era law that makes it illegal for individuals to take wine into another province without going through their liquor control board. Someone from Ontario can ship home a case of Californian shiraz after touring the vineyards, but it is illegal to do the same after tasting merlot in Kelowna.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Albas, a Conservative MP for Okanagan-Coquihalla whose riding includes many British Columbian vineyards, introduced a private member's bill in October to amend the outdated 83-year-old law and allow for free flow of wine for personal consumption. It passed second reading last month. Currently, all “imports” of wine from one province to another must be made by a provincial liquor board or designated private company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That law makes it illegal to ship boxes of wine across provincial borders for individuals or wine clubs, and it prohibits wineries from marketing and shipping direct to consumers in other provinces. “If someone travels to Gatineau [Que.] and purchases wine, the moment it is brought back to Ottawa, the person has broken a federal law,” Mr. Albas says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Quebec, 2011 was a strange political year – a year when voters abruptly turned their coats, leaving party activists terrified and pundits confused. A year that saw an uncharismatic former businessman without a party become the most popular politician in Quebec, not to mention the sudden collapse of the sovereigntist movement, which had dominated the province's politics for half a century.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the federal election, people flocked to the polls to vote for candidates they didn't know anything about, which resulted in the election of 59 Dippers who were the first to be startled by a victory they didn't foresee and had not planned for, since most of them were just stand-ins filling the NDP's candidacy slots. Some of the instant MPs now bestowed with a salary of $157,000 a year were still students. And some didn't even speak French.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bloc Québécois's Gilles Duceppe, who seemed to be a permanent fixture in Parliament and liked by the voters, was sent packing. He spent the following months at home, dourly contemplating the desolation: His party, the dominant federal force in Quebec since 1993, was devastated by the “orange wave” and left with just four seats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, though, the NDP's popularity has sharply declined, while, as in a game of see-saw, the Bloc is regaining some support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the bizarre story of what happened to the Parti Québécois. For the first half of the year, the PQ was poised to form the next provincial government, although leader Pauline Marois was little more popular than Premier Jean Charest. At the party convention in April, Ms. Marois won a confidence vote with a resounding 93.1 per cent of the vote. But then, all hell broke loose, and by June, the Péquistes, including many MNAs and party officials, were openly grumbling about the leader they had so enthusiastically supported two months earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four PQ MNAs resigned, triggering several other defections and an uninterrupted period of infighting that is widely expected to resume after the holiday truce. Unsurprisingly, the PQ started to go down in the polls. Who wants to vote for a leader contested by her own troops? Were the Péquistes trying to commit political suicide? The only rational explanation is that after the Bloc's unexpected rout, panic settled within the PQ ranks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, François Legault, the head of a virtual party that had no formal existence until last December, no high-profile supporters and a half-baked platform heavy with clichés, was climbing in the polls, his main strength being that he promised to stop talking about sovereignty for at least a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1960s, Quebeckers had their <span class="companylink">Quiet Revolution</span>. Now, they were quietly burying the ideal of sovereignty. First they killed the Bloc, then they started to turn against the PQ. Mr. Legault is reaping the benefit of this shift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So here are the questions for 2012. Will Pauline Marois be able to hold on to her position? If not, will Gilles Duceppe succeed her? How long will Mr. Legault live up to his standing in the polls now that he's heading a real rather than a virtual party and has become a real rather than a hypothetical party leader? Will Jack Layton's successor be able to revive the NDP's fortunes in Quebec? If not, will the Bloc re-emerge from its ashes?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the tumultuous events of 2011, only a fool would dare predict what's in store for 2012.</p>

Didn't happen. As recently as two seasons ago, a trio of Russian players were all finalists for the NHL's most valuable player award. The projected top pick in the entry draft this year is Nail Yakupov, and Russia had a goalie, Andrei Vasilevski, that stopped the first 100 shots he faced in the world junior tournament until faltering late Saturday night in a stirring game against Sweden.</p>

After a nice little run following the breakup – Olympic gold for the Czechs in 1998, an unexpected world championship for Slovakia in 2002 – the countries have fallen on harder times of late, with seemingly no Jaromir Jagrs or Zdeno Charas in the pipeline.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They have a strong team, but if we play disciplined and don't take many penalties or stupid penalties, if we play like a team – and hard – then we can win,” said Mrazek, who will likely need to the difference maker for his club. “I think the Russians and Czechs, both teams could go to the semi-finals.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jiri Fischer, a former NHLer and one of the Czech Republic's assistant coaches, concedes that while the Czechs continue to prosper at the senior men's levels internationally, “In the younger groups, we have a lot of work to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is a difference in the mindset of parents, and how they raised their kids,” Fischer continued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“[Costs] can certainly be one of the excuses, but I'm not a fan of excuses. It always comes down to motivation and holding kids accountable and showing them how to work, first with the parents and then the coaches.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slovakia's continuing presence in the tournament is even more unlikely than the Czechs', requiring as it did a massive third-period comeback against the Swiss last Saturday. That was then followed immediately by Sweden's inspired comeback against Russia, proving once again that, in junior hockey, at this level, where the passions run so high, momentum changes can come with dizzying and unexpected frequency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Latvia and Denmark were out of their league at the tournament this time around, but after that, it was a wild ride throughout the preliminary round.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who knows?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The way things have gone, there may be more upsets along the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We knew we had strong team,” said Slovakian right winger Tomas Jurco, who played with Canadian Justin Huberdeau on the Memorial Cup champion Saint John Sea Dogs last season. “We haven't gone to the quarter-finals the last couple of years and we don't know if the next generation is going to make it, so we tried really hard and we were very happy we did it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The winner of the Slovakian-Finnish game meets Sweden in the other semi-final, also Tuesday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arena opened to great fanfare, a ticket sold for every seat, the standing room area packed to the building's timber rafters.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A band struck up the national anthem as the lieutenant-governor entered the building. The hockey teams then skated onto the ice, the home side first, followed by the visitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vice-regal officer stepped onto ice made hard and cold by an ingenious system of pipes beneath the surface. Thomas Wilson Paterson, a railway contractor and former politician, dropped the puck for a ceremonial opening faceoff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One hundred years ago today, on Jan. 2, 1912, the exciting sport of ice hockey made its professional debut on Vancouver Island at a new arena built in Oak Bay, just outside the city of Victoria's boundaries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The sport is all it was cracked up to be and more,” trilled the Daily Times after the game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“With all due reverence to cricket, we think hockey is a trifle faster.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seems hard to imagine a game now so deeply associated with Canadian identity needed any introduction at any time in the Dominion. Hockey was played in the province, especially in the mining towns in the frozen valleys of the Kootenays, but fair weather on southern Vancouver Island permitted only the occasional children's game of shinny on a frozen shallow pond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On that day a century ago, the seven players of the New Westminster Royals sailed across the strait to play the Victoria Senators in the inaugural game of the three-team Pacific Coast Hockey Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The modern arena with artificial ice, as well as the three teams and the league in which they played, were the creation of Frank and Lester Patrick, ambitious and far-sighted brothers who had made a fortune with their father in the lumber business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brothers played pro hockey back east. They figured another fortune was to be made in promoting the sport in the booming Pacific port cities. They intended to challenge for the Stanley Cup, which even then inspired fevered dreams of hockey glory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Vancouver, they built a grand $175,000 arena on Georgia Street overlooking Coal Harbour. The Denman Arena, as it came to be known, boasted a seating capacity of 10,000, making it the largest in the Dominion. Incredibly, the city's population was just 120,000, though it had doubled in five years and the Patricks anticipated further growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Victoria, they built a more modest, but still modern, building of wood. It stood at the corner of Cadboro Bay Road and what is now Epworth Street. (The arena burned to the ground in the early morning hours of Remembrance Day in 1929. The flames, first spotted by a passing milkman, lit up the night sky. The site is now occupied by a pair of three-storey apartment blocks across the street from the Oak Bay Secondary sporting grounds.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world-class arenas helped lure to the coast some of the best-known names in hockey, including Newsy Lalonde, Harry Hyland and Tom Dunderdale. (The Vancouver Millionaires also employed a 19-year-old player called Silent Jack Ulrich, as he was deaf and mute.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Royals wore black and orange sweaters, while the Senators sported a red, white and blue combination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sportswriters wrote in purple.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Every moment provided a fresh sensation and never while playing was going on was the blood given time to cool,” ran a report in the Daily Times. “As the puck darted hither and thither with such dazzling rapidity that at times it was impossible for the crowd to follow its course, the most phlegmatic were stirred to their deepest depths; as spectacular burst crowded upon spectacular burst in almost unending succession, this unrestrained delight brought the spectators up all standing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course the referee came in for criticism from the Daily Colonist for having missed “one or two roughhouse stunts.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Victoria arena opened to the public with an offer of free skating on Christmas Day, leading several downtown stores to advertise a new stock of equipment, with the cheapest pair of men's “skating boots” available for $2.50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victoria lost the first game at the arena by 8-3. In goal for the home side was 31-year-old veteran Bert Lindsay, whose son also became a hockey star. Terrible Ted Lindsay is now 86.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Patricks are credited with such innovations as forward passing, adding bluelines and substituting skaters while play continued. They also sold franchises to interests in Seattle and Portland, Ore., creating an international major pro league a decade before the National Hockey League allowed a New England grocery-store magnate to enter their league with the Boston Bruins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of the short 1912 season, Frank Patrick suggested the Stanley Cup be decided by a series of games, not just a two-game playoff, as was the practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His league sent a letter to the Stanley Cup trustees offering to send a champion by train to Eastern Canada to challenge for the trophy. The suggestion was rejected, as the natural ice used in rinks in Montreal, Toronto and Quebec City would be too slushy by late March. By the end of 1912, the Arena Gardens (later known as the Mutual Street Arena) in Toronto had artificial ice. It was the way of the future of pro hockey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, the Stanley Cup finals end in balmy June. And the storied trophy has even been won by a team in Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A forgotten arena in Victoria was once the stage that showed how such wonders were possible.</p>

In the end, losing pregnancy weight was easy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time the baby was eight months, the 36-year-old mom weighed 154 pounds, thanks to a nutritionist and DVD workouts using kettle bells. Then, to add definition, she hired a trainer who bumped up the workouts and created a lean eating plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result: Ms. Moore dropped 10 pounds in a month. But her New Year's resolution is to incorporate yoga into an already busy schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My goal</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My workout</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I work out in the morning. On Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, I'm at the gym at 5:30 a.m., and weekends, I'm at the gym at 8.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Tuesdays and Thursdays I run intervals on the treadmill. This morning, I walked on incline 1 for five minutes, then did 30 seconds at 9; then 30 seconds jump right off the treadmill and then 30 seconds at 9, 30 seconds off. I do that for 10 sets, then walk for five minutes, and then do another 10 sets, but every time I jump back on the treadmill I go up in terms of speed so 9.1, then 9.2, all the way up to 10. Then, after that, I walk for five minutes, jog for five minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Fridays I do a full-body circuit by myself.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“On days I work out with my trainer, I have to eat before I meet with her – it's too gruelling otherwise. I have breakfast after my workout on days I train alone. Breakfast is steel-cut oatmeal and egg whites. A post-workout meal can be a piece of Ezekiel bread with nut butter or an apple and almonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“After the show, I usually have ground turkey and spinach with brown rice or white fish with bok choy – some protein with veggie and a complex carb. At 3 p.m., a meal might be two eggs and six egg whites with a green vegetable in an omelette. Dinner is protein and a vegetable.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My motivation</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Feeling good, being in front of the camera, and looking the best I can.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Every couple of months, my trainer comes up with goals that have included such things</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Find a yoga style</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If yoga is new to Tracy, a beginner-friendly class is important. But it doesn't mean she can't look for a power class that will challenge her because she has fitness and strength already. I recommend a class on Sundays instead of a run, and one other, perhaps Thursdays. In her first month, Tracy should be trying out different studios and styles of yoga to see what she enjoys.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Make room for dessert</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Stick to a rule: 80 to 90 per cent of the time clean [eating] and 10 to 20 per cent of the time treats. That will help keep her cravings at bay and [let her] enjoy life. In a week, if Tracy is eating 35 meals, four to seven meals are for indulging in a treat or enjoying a glass of wine. When you spread it out that way, it never looks to be that bad.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. junior coach Dean Blais might be surprised to learn he has anything in common with former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, but apparently he does.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a funny old world,” the Iron Lady said toward the end of her run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Hockey's a funny game,” Blais said Saturday night with a slight grimace as his team came to its unsuccessful end of the preliminary round, defeated 3-2 by unbeaten Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blais meant that the game is relatively unpredictable. You can run into a hot goalie – as his team did against the Czech Republic. You can have trouble scoring, as happens periodically to the greatest and most dependable snipers. Pucks skip on ice chips, bounce oddly off boards, ricochet madly off bodies on a shot from the point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unbelievable can also happen, and regularly does as in the world junior hockey championship: Marc-André Fleury of Canada was named top goaltender in the 2003 tournament, and in the 2004 championship he put a puck off his own defenceman into his own net, giving the U.S. team the gold medal. In 2009 a powerful Russian team blew an icing late in the game, allowing Canada's Jordan Eberle to tie the game with 5.4 seconds to play, win the shootout and send Canada on to its fifth consecutive gold medal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is so far unbelievable about the 2012 world juniors is how weak the hockey was in Edmonton – where Canada, the silver medalists last year, played – and how strong it has been in Calgary, where Russia and Sweden put on the show of the preliminary round and where the Canadians have now come to play the games that will decide the medals this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadians romped over weak opponents with an aggregate score of 23-3 after playing Finland, the Czech Republic and Denmark. While the Finns later overcame their obvious stage fright, growing stronger each match, they were not any force at all when meeting Canada in their first game, which they lost 8-1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only game that was even close was the New Year's Eve match against Blais's U.S. squad, a game that ended 3-2 and had the Canadians rather, well, exaggerating the import of the result.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was simply remarkable how often the players used that beloved hockey word “adversity” in their postgame interviews. “You want to be playing your best,” top Canadian scorer Mark Stone said. “That adversity is good for us.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Every game you face a little adversity,” Brendan Gallagher added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even coach Don Hay – now 11-0 as world junior championship coach – joined in: “I think that game will only make us better. Whenever you have to deal with a little bit of adversity and pressure, it's good for you. You really see some things from your players when the game is on the line.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In truth, the game against the Americans – the Canadians roaring out to a 3-0 lead, then growing sloppy in the third period – was only a hint of adversity. The game was meaningless to both sides. What energy it had came from a packed rink, the natural animosity between the two teams and an admirable surge of pride from the U.S. youngsters in the last half of the game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is, however, a profound difference between must wins and wins. The pressures of the third period in Edmonton were all personal – pressures from now on will be internal and external, but above all national. No one has to tell any one of these Canadian players or coaches that only gold will do, that the long-ago <span class="companylink">Nike</span> ad that Canadians once disdained – “You don't win silver, you lose gold” – applies perfectly when it comes to Canadian hockey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Make no mistake: This is a superb team. It has proved it can score when early predictions were that it would have trouble scoring. It is well coached by Hay, an excellent communicator. It has some players with good chemistry – Stone and Jonathan Huberdeau, for example – and some players who have yet to get going. It has two goaltenders – Scott Wedgewood and Mark Visentin – who have allowed a mere five goals in four games, yet no one can yet say which one is the one to carry Canada's hopes into the medal round. All Hay could say Saturday was, “Both goalies have played really well. … Both deserve the opportunity to start the next game.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is all to say that this junior Team Canada, from goal on out, has yet to be tested, yet to feel true adversity, yet to feel pressure so real and immediate and unfair and fierce that it is a wonder these child-men do not implode from the outrageous expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They would not wish it any other way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, rightly or wrongly, neither would the country.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time last year, I set out my three-point wish list for Canada in 2011.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wish No. 1 was that decisive action be taken to transform the inefficient health-care system that's devouring an ever-increasing portion of government spending while leaving large numbers of patients to suffer on waiting lists. Unfortunately, 2011 was another year of rearranging the proverbial deck chairs on this deteriorating, bureaucratic monopoly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My wish for the year ahead is that Canada finally joins every other OECD country in giving patients and health-care providers freedom of choice between government-run megahospitals and independent, patient-friendly clinics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second wish for 2011 was that Canadian universities would refocus limited taxpayer funds toward fields critical to the country's economic future. Unfortunately, universities continue to turn away a large portion of qualified students applying for in-demand fields such as engineering, applied mathematics, systems analysis and medicine. Meanwhile, they graduate huge numbers of arts, education and social-science students who face high unemployment rates and low-paying careers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 2012, my wish is that provincial education ministers will finally force long-overdue change in the self-serving culture of “academic independence” that is doing both the students and the country such a disservice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My third wish last year was that the provinces would take concrete steps to get their finances under control. Unfortunately, every province but Saskatchewan continued to incur substantial deficits, with Ontario and Quebec leading the perilous parade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario's debt grew to a staggering $238-billion, prompting <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Investor Services to place the province on credit watch and downgrade its credit rating from “stable” to “negative.” Quebec's $3.8-billion deficit over the past fiscal year added 11 per cent to the province's debt, which now stands at more than 50 per cent of gross domestic product, by far the highest of any province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than reducing their spending, these and other provinces continue to depend upon rosy economic growth forecasts to save them. The euro-zone debt crisis and U.S. economic doldrums pose very serious risks to Canada's economy, making those rosy growth forecasts akin to fairy tales. My wish for 2012 is that provinces face the stark truth that tax revenues will more likely decline than grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such discouraging lack of progress on my 2011 list might have deterred me from adding new wishes, but hope springs eternal. My hopes for 2012 concern two issues beyond our borders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, I hope euro-zone leaders will finally recognize that, as former British prime minister Maggie Thatcher once wrote, “the European single currency is bound to fail, economically, politically and, indeed, socially.” Two basic flaws doomed the euro concept from the outset: the unsustainable arrangement requiring financially prudent countries to support the irresponsible ones; and the fact that adopting the euro removed the shock absorber that allows markets to adjust the value of a country's currency to its financial position and productivity. After wasting hundreds of billions of borrowed euros trying to save the euro zone in 2011, the new year finds the crisis dramatically worse. Attempting to sustain any fundamentally flawed arrangement makes its failure an even more catastrophic event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My second hope for 2012 is that implementing the democratic aspirations of the Arab Spring in the Middle East doesn't unleash a tyranny of the majority, wherein the rights of ethnic and religious minorities are undefended. That would not only encourage tragic internal conflicts and human-rights abuses, but further destabilize a region of crucial importance to the global energy supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world economy enters 2012 facing issues far more intractable than those present after the 2008 financial meltdown. For Europe and the U.S., navigating the many dangerous global shoals ahead will require political wisdom notably absent in 2011. Canada, too, faces important issues that demand attention. But compared with almost anywhere else on the planet, Canadians are blessed with a wonderful country.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years ago, the head of Canada's pathologists association said the country's medical-testing laboratories were unravelling at the seams. “Perhaps we just didn't yell loud enough,” Jagdish Butany said then, explaining that the problems had been festering for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's worth yelling about now. Laboratories all over Canada, in provinces rich and poor, have committed far too many life-altering mistakes. Like a game of Whac-a-Mole, each time the people of one province discover to their horror a long-standing pattern of laboratory errors, and that province resolves to figure out why, another horror story pops up in another province.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enough. The provinces should urgently convene an expert panel to ensure that every province and territory constructs its medical care on a solid foundation of pathology and diagnostic imaging. They should develop a system of quality controls that are proven and consistent, to the extent possible, throughout Canada. And they should be able to count on the backing of the premiers and health ministers. Any province that wishes not to accept and apply the standard of care would be accountable to its residents for an explanation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it is a matter of money, it should be obvious by now that cost savings in pathology are illusory. Medical care built on haphazard test data is a waste of money, effort and expertise, not to mention dangerous. But the latest province to reveal pathology problems is Alberta, where lack of money is surely not an excuse for the pattern of errors at three hospitals (one in Calgary, one in Edmonton and one in Drumheller) uncovered since November. Alberta's discoveries follow on problems identified with four radiologists in British Columbia last winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that followed on problems with diagnostic imaging and pathology in Manitoba and Ontario, which followed on New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador. At least 386 people had their breast-cancer tests botched in Newfoundland and Labrador between 1997 and 2005; the government settled a class-action lawsuit for $17.5-million. A judge who handled New Brunswick's review said, “The Department of Health had no idea whether the pathology laboratories in the province were operating at acceptable levels of quality.” The problems in that province went on for more than a decade. If that isn't worth yelling about, what is?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it's worth yelling about the individual cases, even if it cannot be conclusively shown that the errors led to deaths. In Powell River, B.C., John Moser went in for a scan in August, 2010, and no cancer was detected. That December, he was admitted to hospital; last January, he died. “He literally collapsed before he was finally diagnosed with cancer,” his daughter, Janet Baird, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all the noise about federal-provincial funding agreements for health, the crisis in pathology has not been given the national attention it deserves. Fixing pathology before the next discovery of botched tests should be a priority for the entire country.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I desperately need help with my arms – they look like cottage cheese. Can you suggest any exercises I should be doing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Try the circuit outlined below. Do all three exercises back to back with no rest. At the end of the set, rest for one minute and then repeat the entire thing twice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Triceps straight arm pullover: Lie on your back with your legs bent and feet on floor. Hold a weight in each hand with arms straight over your shoulders. Palms face each other. Keep your arms straight and slowly lower your arms backward until they reach your ears. Pause for a second and return to the starting position. Repeat 15 times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">French press: Lie on your back with your legs bent and feet on floor. Hold a weight in each hand, arms straight up over your shoulders, palms facing each other. Keep still from your elbow to your shoulder as you bend at your elbows so the weight lowers toward your ears. Return to starting position and repeat 15 times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make both exercises harder, do them with your head and shoulders on a stability ball.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Biceps to shoulder press: Hold a weight in each hand. Bend at your elbows and curl the weights up toward your shoulders and then press weights over your head. Lower back down and repeat for 15 reps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To challenge your balance, stand on one leg as you perform the exercise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Note: Videos for the French press and biceps exercise can be found on The Globe and Mail website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trainer's tip</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some variety, try a set of 11s. Start with 10 French presses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Follow them up with one biceps curl. Then do nine French presses followed by two biceps curls. Continue to decrease the French press by one repetition and to increase the biceps curls until you are doing one French press and 10 biceps curls. The reps should always add up to 11. Attempt to take minimal breaks throughout the set.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leafs need 2012 to be Reimer time</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto's playoff chances this spring might rest on goalie's ability to stand out down the stretch</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is a face that represents the future of the Toronto Maple Leafs, then it is goaltender James Reimer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, it is still a face of uncertainty for both. While Reimer and the Leafs went into this season full of promise, thanks to their emergence in the last calendar year, the jury is still out on both parties because of their uneven performances so far this season. Reimer and the Leafs tumbled to 10th place in the <span class="companylink">NHL's Eastern Conference</span> with a terrible December and who knows where they will be come the playoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One year ago Sunday, Reimer was given his first <span class="companylink">NHL</span> start. No one expected much, since he was just a kid up from the farm team thanks to injuries to Jean-Sébastien Giguère, the veteran starter, and the anointed successor, Jonas Gustavsson. But things happened quickly after Reimer stoned the Ottawa Senators for a 5-1 win.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reimer just kept getting better and by the time he turned 23 on March 15 he was the No. 1 goaltender. He finished the season with a 20-10-5 record, a 2.60 goals-against average and .921 save percentage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he looks back on the last year, Reimer says the point where he knew he could play and thrive in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> came on Jan. 10 and 11 when he beat the Los Angeles Kings and San Jose Sharks in back-to-back road games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That was my first game playing huge players like [Patrick] Marleau, [Joe] Thornton and [Dany] Heatley,” Reimer said. “To play back to back against those guys and win was something.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Leafs may have finished out of the playoffs for the sixth consecutive season but this time there was a sense of optimism about general manager Brian Burke's rebuilding job. In addition to Reimer, 11 new faces came to the Leafs dressing room by the start of the new season in trades (Matthew Lombardi, Cody Franson, Jake Gardiner, Joffrey Lupul, John-Michael Liles, Keith Aulie and Dave Steckel), free-agent signings (Tim Connolly and Phillipe Dupuis) and the draft (Matt Frattin).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Lupul and Phil Kessel combining to be two of the top scorers in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> in the first three months of the regular season, the Leafs charged out of the gate and to the upper reaches despite some old problems that continued to linger. By the new year, those lingering problems, a bad defensive game and an almost comically inept penalty-killing unit, wiped out that optimism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An equally vexing problem is the goaltending. Reimer missed 18 games after he was hit on the head by Montreal Canadiens forward Brian Gionta on Oct. 22. Since his return Dec. 3, Reimer has struggled to be consistent. He was good in consecutive games just before Christmas, giving hope he found his game, but then imploded in a loss to the Florida Panthers on Dec. 27 and wasn't a lot better in losing to the Carolina Hurricanes and then the Winnipeg Jets last Saturday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking ahead, the Leafs have four games at home in the next eight days. Three are against teams they are fighting for a playoff spot – the Tampa Bay Lightning, Winnipeg and Buffalo Sabres. If they can't get the new year launched right, it will be another bad spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either Reimer or Gustavsson, who also struggled to be consistent, has to step forward and seize the job as No. 1 goaltender by playing well enough to overcome the team's other problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chiefly, that means making saves when the Leafs are trying to kill penalties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dion Phaneuf and the rest of the defencemen have to stop undermining strong offensive play with mistakes in the Leafs' zone. And forward such as Mikhail Grabovski and Nikolai Kulemin have to start scoring to take the pressure off Kessel and Lupul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">********</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEVERENDING CLASSIC</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sellout crowd of a little more than 44,000 is expected at Citizens Bank Park. Of those seats, according to The Associated Press, 20,000 were distributed through the Philadelphia Flyers, 10,000 through the New York Rangers, 4,000 through the Philadelphia Phillies and the rest through the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> and its sponsors. The Flyers put on a three-day festival around the baseball park and team president Peter Luukko said they expect 175,000 fans for it. Aside from an alumni game last Saturday, there are a couple of university games on Wednesday and Thursday, followed by an American Hockey League game on Friday between the Flyers' farm team, the Adirondack Phantoms, and the Hershey Bears.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STORYLINES TO WATCH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CONCUSSION EPIDEMIC</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunday marked the one-year anniversary of the hit that ultimately caused the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s biggest star to stay on the sidelines for more than 10 months. But Thursday marks the one-year anniversary of the second hit Sidney Crosby took that week, one that may be just as responsible or even more responsible for his serious concussion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Crosby is back on the injured list because of a seemingly innocuous hit last month that limited his comeback to eight games. He is still experiencing concussion symptoms and there is no estimate for his return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, Crosby's injury was the one that may have finally shaken the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s complacency about the rash of concussions among the players. The concussion debate gained steam over the past year, although a solution is not in sight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing to keep an eye on in this regard are the annual general managers' meetings Mar. 12 through 14 in Boca Raton, Fla. Almost all of the discussions will probably concern remedies. Look for a long list of ideas to be kicked around, from better equipment to finally outlawing all hits to the head to slowing the game down. Putting the red line back in play to slow down traffic in the neutral zone is a popular idea in the media but at this point does not seem to have much support among the GMs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Desert (non)dealings</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rumblings persist that this could be the Phoenix Coyotes' final season in the suburban city of Glendale. Despite the insistence of city and <span class="companylink">NHL</span> officials that talks continue with two interested ownership groups, other <span class="companylink">NHL</span> people say there is an equal chance the Coyotes will be headed to Quebec City come spring. But Seattle is now gaining some traction as talk of a new arena is starting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the local bids is fronted by former San Jose Sharks president Greg Jamison while the other is led by lobbyist and prominent Republican John Kaites, who has connections to Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More might be known about the chances of either bid succeeding later this week. City officials say council expects to vote to approve one of the bids by January or February and the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> has not objected to the timing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glendale councillor Phil Lieberman recently told the Arizona Republic he hopes to get more information at a closed-door council meeting on Tuesday. Then again, he told The Globe and Mail the same thing last month and nothing came of it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At times such as the Winter Classic Monday, it appears as if there are two NHLs. The league on display in Philadelphia is a product of the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> head office in New York, a hybrid mix of NBC promotion and pandering to U.S. sensibilities in the hope of gaining a more significant TV toehold in the United States. The other <span class="companylink">NHL</span> is the rump Canadian league defined by Hockey Night in Canada, more religion than a hockey league. A given in the national fabric.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two solitudes represent very separate notions of the game and run parallel during the regular season before colliding in the Stanley Cup final. For Americans, hockey equals a game; for Canadians, it's a cult. U.S. sensibilities are not welcome in the Canadian iteration of the league; Canadian teams need not apply for HBO's 24/7 series or the Winter Classic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or so it often seems. But Monday, the cultures collide on the newly christened NBC Sports Network (formerly Versus) in the form of a documentary on the 1972 Summit Series between Canada and the Soviet Union. While the iconic series has been relived in various forms in Canada, this 40th anniversary year provides the first serious look at the series for a U.S. audience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Produced by Ross Greenburg, the man behind the heralded 24/7 series, Cold War On Ice: Summit Series 1972 delves once more into the sociopolitical nature of the series won (spoiler alert) by Canada in eight games. Americans are intimately connected with the 1980 “Do you believe in miracles?” U.S. triumph over the Soviet Union in Lake Placid. But Cold War On Ice will show that long before Mike Eruzione &amp; Co. vanquished the Soviets, a Canadian team had climbed that mountain eight years earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NBC was unable to provide an advance screener of the series, but the PR bumph makes it clear that Phil Esposito will be front and centre with his own version of events. “They stole our beer,” he moans. “We had to drink vodka. Homemade vodka. You ever taste homemade vodka? Go into your garage and get turpentine and drink it. Holy cripe it is bad.” Others interviewed include Paul Henderson, Bobby Clarke, Vladislav Tretiak and Alexander Yakushev.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Winter Classic as a lead-in, Cold War On Ice should garner a sizable audience to a story engraved in the conscience of every Canadian (some of who actively rooted for the Soviets). Now it remains for Hockey Night to produce a documentary about the Americans' 1980 Olympic triumph and they'll be even.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pressure points</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking of 24/7, did the episode last Wednesday show Philadelphia Flyers coach Peter Laviolette applying pressure on his star Claude Giroux to return quickly from a concussion? In the clip Giroux seems clearly conflicted about whether he's ready to return. Laviolette reassures him that he looks great and stresses the team needs him back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> injury dilemma in a nutshell: a player clearly apprehensive about aggravating an injury and a coach under pressure to end a losing skid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hockey Night in Canada's Hot Stove panel picked up on the clip last Saturday. Mike Milbury, the only panelist to have played and coached in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>, wrote it off to Laviolette's straightforward nature, adding, “It does set up the kind of the difficulty in this day and age with all the concussions and the severity of concussions the problems players face and the sensitivity that coaches have to have to that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The episode might have become bigger had Giroux been reinjured, à la Sidney Crosby. But Giroux's four points in his first game back stilled that issue for now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the way, there was no mention on Hockey Night of Milbury's recent legal scare, resolved in his favour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sad news</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a major loss for Canadian sports broadcasting, former head of CBC Sports production Doug Sellars died New Year's Eve as a result of a heart attack suffered while playing (what else?) recreational hockey. Within two years of joining CBC Sports, Sellars produced a Grey Cup game and went on to oversee all CBC Sports properties, including several Olympics and two Commonwealth Games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A multiple Gemini Award winner, Sellars moved on to Fox Sports, where he worked his way up to executive vice-president at Fox Sports Media Group. John Shannon, who ran Hockey Night during Sellars' tenure, tweeted Saturday, “Sellars was the consummate pro. Since moving to Fox, Doug was a great advocate for the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>. Doug didn't just makes stars, HE was a Star!” We second that emotion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Question</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I own a mid-sized, downtown Toronto company. One employee suffers debilitating anxiety that affects his decision making, attendance and co-workers. His lack of fortitude and constant need for attention is wearing thin. How do I approach him to seek help? There may be legal ramifications due to the stigma of being singled out. Creating a cause to dismiss rather than rehabilitate seems cowardly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you, as an employer, observe problematic behaviours in the workplace, it's time to act. I agree it's a delicate issue but if you address it empathetically, while maintaining strict boundaries, it will be better for every one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter how sympathetic they are, anxious co-workers can have a disruptive effect. A low tolerance for stress, a tendency to think catastrophically and reassurance-seeking behaviours – questions such as “Am I doing okay?” – can be fatiguing to co-workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not your role to diagnose but it is your responsibilityto encourage that employee to seek help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Arrange a meeting in a confidential, private area at a scheduled time,” said Ash Bender, a psychiatrist and the clinic head of the work, stress and health program at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto. “You meet with them and provide very fair and objective feedback.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, you could mention how long you've worked together and say you recently observed changes in behaviour and work performance. Then ask: “Is there anything you could tell me that would help me to better assist you at your job.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal with this first meeting is to create a forum for dialogue. Suggest an employee-assistance program, if you have one, or perhaps have human resources facilitate further assessment, if necessary. The employee also has to take personal responsibility by seeking help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do not end the meeting until you have achieved the following: urged the employee to seek appropriate care, provided information on additional resources, developed an agreed-upon action plan and arranged a follow-up meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After that initial meeting, do two things: document that conversation to yourself and send a written summary letter to the employee, stating what you have agreed. This will help the worker digest what transpired; it's amazing how two people can have totally different takes of a meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may be that you will need to modify the employee's duties or hours of work during treatment; that will send the message you are a fair and equitable employer. However, most employers typically require additional documentation from a medical professional before taking such a step.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A supportive process is more likely to resolve in a successful outcome than a confrontational, adversarial process,” said Dr. Bender. “This could be a very valued employee and it sends a message to the office that we acknowledge these things and we try to address them.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hello and Happy New Year.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An especially cheery Happy New Year goes out to a cabal of like-minded readers. When we last met, a list of Most Irritating Canadians (TV-related) was the topic. Some TV actors, pundits, annoying TV adverts and politicians were given the subject of jocular remarks. When I returned from a two-week refresher course in being contrary, I read all the mail. To my amusement, a number of correspondents declared the list politically motivated. And what was truly amusing was the use of the same words and phrases in complaints from different people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's really swell that people get together, share their dislikes and act on them together. Cathartic, no doubt, and peachy. But, listen, if you're going to complain together, it's best not to use the same words and phrases. In such cases, this thing called a thesaurus is dead-handy. You're welcome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now then, what's going on? If I've got this straight, what's going on is that nobody is going to the movies. In the avalanche of year-end lists and pontifications that marked the end of 2011, I'm pretty sure I read that movie-attendance has fallen to shockingly low levels. Little wonder. Look at all the lists of Top Ten Movies of 2011 and ask yourself: Are there are more than two you'd pay to see?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is where our favourite topic, television, comes in. Obviously, people both here and in the U.S. are watching TV. And it doesn't matter whether it's on an old-school TV set, a grand flat-screen thingy on the wall showing everything in HD, or on a laptop while sitting in bed with the dogs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Television's challenge in 2012 is to keep getting better. To entertain, distract and sometimes reflect the searing reality in which so many people exist. Movies aren't doing it, are they?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bachelor (ABC, City TV, 8 p.m.) returns and is the big deal on tonight's menu. Now, before you start rolling you're eyes heavenward, remember this: It's cold outside, the Christmas bills are piling up and life is kind of tedious. This is the ideal time to indulge in watching cheerfully trashy, contrived nonsense about a gaggle of ladies vying for the hand of some handsome lug who is, of course, in the end, far less charming that he seems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On this, the 16th edition, the bachelor is Ben Flajnik, a 29-year-old California winemaker. He was the chap spurned at the end of the 2011 edition of The Bachelorette. He proposed to bachelorette Ashley Hebert, but she turned him down and took a chance on one J.P. Rosenbaum instead. Look, it's trash, but it's as good a tonic as thinking about a winter holiday in the sun somewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've said it before and I'll say it again: Shows such as The Bachelor are our equivalent of ancient, midwinter celebrations of life and love, a rejection of cold and darkness. It's a primordial impulse to indulge in life-affirming fun and play silly games in the middle of long, dark winters. Our ancestors did it and we're doing the same darn thing. Western civilization will not fall if millions watch Ben choose a lady. (And I use the term “lady” with reservation, given the advance publicity devoted to some of the contestants.) In fact it will continue to thrive. Stories of wooing and courting are at the bedrock of our culture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not to say that TV's only role in 2012 is to offer frivolity. Over the next few months we will see the arrival of several important dramas that will provoke and challenge viewers, from the soft satire of GCB (formerly called Good Christian Bitches) on ABC to the probably corrosive satire of HBO's Veep, about a female Senator who finds being Vice-President of the United States is nothing like she expected. The latter comes from Brit writer Armando Iannucci, responsible for The Thick of It and I'm Alan Partridge. Plus HBO's Game Change, which follows John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, from his selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate to their defeat in the election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's the fluff and the fiercely engaged with politics, money and the madness of now. It's going to be a great year. And if anybody wants to complain that my endorsement of The Bachelor is a partisan shot at the Conservative Party of Canada, I'm interested to hear your views. Remember to use a thesaurus, though, if there's more than one of you writing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Airing Tonight: Craig Ferguson's International House of Comedy (CBC, 9 p.m.) is a distilled version of the gala opening to last year's Just for Laughs festival in Montreal. Ferguson hosts a one-hour stand-up comedy show with bits from Nina Conti, Ryan Belleville, Danny Bhoy and Adam Hills. There is also an appearance by Eddie Izzard. As always with these things, the quality of the comedy varies wildly. Belleville does a very good segment about being a Canadian in other countries. But it's Ferguson himself who is outstanding – throwing jokes at everything with deftness and precision, including a brilliant bit about the alleged love triangle of Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie.</p>

Continuing violence by security forces is showcasing the League's impotence and irrelevance and dashed any hope that League observers might help stem the bloodshed. According to Syrian activists, the reverse is true – protesters have faced a growing assault since the observers arrived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their mission appears to have been designed for failure. With 60 monitors on the ground and another 90 to follow, the number of atrocities is too many and their locations too vast for observers to even scratch the surface. The observers are completely dependent on the Syrian government for transport and security and are unable to speak to victims without tipping off authorities, who have reportedly hidden hundreds of detainees in off-limits military sites. Without unrestricted access to hot spots, the results of any observer mission will lack credibility.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The choice of a Sudanese general to head the Arab League mission underlines why the League's member states, many with atrocious human-rights records, are incapable of monitoring one of their own. Lieutenant-General Mohamed Mustafa al-Dabi has held key security positions in the regime of President Omar al-Bashir, himself wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of committing genocide in Darfur – charges the Arab League has denounced. Appointing the former chief of a military intelligence branch accused of atrocities to head a mission monitoring a peace initiative would be amusing if more than 5,000 Syrians, mostly civilians, had not already died in a vicious nine-month government crackdown and many more lives continue to be at stake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The League's lackadaisical approach to monitoring reflects the organization's ambivalence. Comprised of despots who share much in common with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, not least their disdain for the human rights of their respective citizens, Arab League members were reluctant, just until two months ago, to pressure their old friend, Mr. al-Assad, to stop the massacres. Until now, the Arab League has merely lent legitimacy to an illegitimate process and helped prolong the abuses that the Syrian government continues to orchestrate unchecked. If it wishes to salvage what remains of its reputation, the Arab League should replace Lt.-Gen. al-Dabi, assign more observers and stop Mr. al-Assad from manipulating its mission.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time MP pensions were on the chopping block was 1993, when Preston Manning and the Reform Party came to Ottawa to change the way Canada did politics. The Reformers said gold-plated MP pensions put politicians out of touch with ordinary Canadians. They did the noble thing by “opting out” of the parliamentary pension plan. But when Jean Chrétien's government gave them the opportunity to retroactively opt in after the 2000 election, the take-up was nearly unanimous.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The math was so simple that MP Ian McClelland, by then a member of the Canadian Alliance, described his dilemma this way: “To choose between being called a hypocrite and stupid, I would choose to be called a hypocrite.” Colleague Monte Solberg observed that refusing the pension was like wearing a hair shirt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the grand scheme of things, the $25-million taxpayers put into the MP pension plan last year is small potatoes. That's less than the federal government spends every hour of the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But MP pensions are important for their symbolic value, not only to taxpayers but to the 280,000 public servants who take comfort in knowing their entitlements won't be touched while the MPs' plan remains in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To taxpayers, the salient number is the $3-billion Ottawa currently kicks into the public servant pension scheme, an amount that's certain to grow by leaps and bounds. Last month, the C.D. Howe Institute calculated that the federal public pension liability is $80-billion higher than government estimates. Except among public-sector devotees, it's hard to find anyone who believes that pensions for government workers are connected to economic reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But before MPs take on public-sector pensions, they need to look in the mirror. Some parliamentarians argue that they are in a different category than public servants because they sacrifice their best income-earning years to serve the greater good. But for many, being an MP is the best job they will ever have. For high achievers such as Jim Prentice (now vice-chairman for CIBC), it's hard to say his time in Ottawa hurt his long-term earning potential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What makes it all the more difficult for MPs to tackle public servants' pensions is the advantages they hold over their underlings:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While government workers get 2 per cent credit of earnings for each year of service, MPs get 3 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A long-serving MP's pension tops out at 75 per cent of “best earnings,” whereas government workers get 70 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MPs contribute 7 per cent of their salaries to pension, while government workers contribute 8.4 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Stephen Harper's government is looking for inspiration, it should consider what Mike Harris did in Ontario in 1996. Today, Ontario MPPs contribute 10 per cent of their income into an RRSP-style system. As the economy goes, so goes the value of the pension.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately for Ontario taxpayers, Mr. Harris did not take the next logical step and convert all public-sector pensions into a defined-contribution RRSP system. But unlike MPPs, government workers had unions to guard their entitlements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the best evidence that MP and public-sector pensions are going the way of the dodo bird is what began happening on Jan. 1, right under Mr. Harper's nose. As of that date, membership in the <span class="companylink">Export Development Canada</span> defined-benefit pension plan has been cut off, with all new hires enrolled in a defined-contribution pension plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a financial institution, EDC is following the example set by the Royal Bank, which is also now placing new hires into a defined-contribution pension stream. The bank calls it responsible financial management, making pension costs more predictable and reflective of market reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, evidence indicates that membership in defined-benefit plans is in decline. But while government plans may be the last bastion, fall they will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By limiting pension reforms to new hires and the newly elected, Mr. Harper can gain support from those already in the system. But the sooner the government turns off the tap, the sooner we stop perpetuating an inequity and burdening future generations.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saskatchewan is heading in the wrong direction by adding a new category of private, faith-based schools eligible for public money. With the province becoming a destination for immigrants from all over the world, it has an opportunity to build public schools that will bring people together. Instead, the effect will be to emphasize separateness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province should weave diversity into the public system. Canada is full of examples of how to do this. Toronto's board offers after-school minority-language instruction. Edmonton offers special schools in the public system for minority languages. Montreal, despite some notable controversies, has been accommodating to people of many cultures and faiths.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wave of immigration from Asia, Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America that has changed Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto broke late in Saskatchewan. It is now arriving. That will be a boon. There will be new sources of labour, new talents, new residents who can help drive economic growth, new sources of creativity, art and food.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province's new rules give students in “qualified independent schools” 50 per cent of the per-student funding in the public system. The province already funds “associate schools” – another set of independent schools – to 80 per cent of the per-student public average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A diverse population needs strong core institutions. It needs rallying points and meeting places, especially for its young people. John Tory, running for Ontario premier as a Progressive Conservative in 2007, was thrashed by voters when he tried to extend funding to faith-based schools (beyond the existing Roman Catholic system, which is publicly supported, and which, unfortunate though it is, has its roots in Canada's founding). He failed to appreciate how strongly the public favours integration and worries about isolation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diverse public schools are a multicultural society's best way to promote unity, while still preserving difference.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have cheered for the Swiss, marvelled at the Russians and were treated to a barn burner of a game this past Saturday, when Sweden secured the top spot in Pool A with a brilliant come-from-behind overtime victory in the final match of the world junior round robin.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Calgary fans haven't seen yet is an appearance by Canada, the home team, which played its preliminary-round games up the road in Edmonton. All that changes Tuesday night in the tournament's semi-finals here, when Canada faces the winner of the Russia-Czech Republic quarter-final game Monday and has a chance to advance to the gold-medal game for the 11th year in a row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And as much as the players enjoyed their welcome in Edmonton, defenceman Brandon Gormley said they are looking forward to the venue change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's going to be great here,” predicted Gormley, the linchpin of Canada's seven-man defence corps. “The fans haven't seen us yet here in a real game. We're looking forward to having them cheer us on.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gormley's history makes him a particularly interesting subject for all the die-hard Calgary fans who remember how he was chosen 13th overall in the 2010 entry draft by the Phoenix Coyotes with a pick acquired from the Flames in an ill-fated deal that brought Olli Jokinen to town for the first time in March of 2009. The Jokinen trade, which cost the Flames the services of Matthew Lombardi, Brandon Prust and that first-round pick, was universally panned. Calgary eventually cut its losses and shipped Jokinen to the New York Rangers less than a year later for Ales Kotalik and Chris Higgins. Jokinen eventually returned to the Flames as a free agent and is playing much better the second time around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, for an NHL team such as the Flames, who desperately need an infusion of young, high-end talent, the thought that Gormley has the potential to play 15 quiet, effective NHL seasons for a different organization might be a bit galling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at this stage of the proceedings, with little margin for error, all that is put aside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gormley is wearing the home colours and he and his defence partners will ultimately make or break Canada's chances to win a gold medal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing about team defence is ever sexy. None of the seven defenceman has previously played in the tournament and two, Scott Harrington and Nathan Beaulieu, were injured in Canada's 3-2 win over the United States last Saturday – Harrington on a hit from J.T. Miller, Beaulieu when he took a puck in the face. Both are expected to play Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada coach Don Hay has described Gormley as the “glue” that keeps the defence together. The 19-year-old is from Murray River, PEI, and his primary hockey-playing influence is Brad Richards, who hails from nearby Murray Harbour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richards left home at 14 to play at the Athol Murray College of Notre Dame in Wilcox, Sask. A dozen years later, Gormley followed in his footsteps, attending the school at the same time as Jaden Schwartz, Canada's captain. Jordan Eberle, a former world junior hero, is also an alumnus of Notre Dame, where the value and importance of playing for Canada internationally is ingrained at an early age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hay believes that this deep into the tournament, after the players have been together for more than three weeks, it should have become less a collection of individuals and more of a team. Gormley sees the value in that, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think the boys have done a really good job of that,” he said, “and that's how it's got to be. You've gotta play for each other.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for how close he came to joining the Flames, Gormley knows the history, and is happy enough to be a Coyotes prospect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I've been down to Phoenix for two camps, for playoffs last year and for two summer camps,” Gormley said. “Calgary would be a great place to play as well. Any Canadian city would be a lot of fun, especially for a Canadian boy. But I'm happy where I am in Phoenix. They've got a great team there. Hopefully, I can crack that lineup soon.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upward of three million people will be watching Canada's world junior semi-final against Russia, but arguably, no one will have a greater rooting interest than Jacques Bealieu, coach of the OHL's Sarnia Sting. Beaulieu's son, Nathan, plays for Canada, last year's finalists, while his star pupil, Nail Yakupov, just happens to be with Russia, the defending champions.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But let there be no mistake here about who Beaulieu wants to win. It's Canada – and he even has something riding on the outcome. Just before Yakupov left for the world junior tournament, the Russian prodigy and Beaulieu made a friendly wager just in case Canada and Russian happened to cross paths during the event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should Canada emerge victorious, Yakupov will be obliged to wear a red-and-white Canadian sweater for a full week of practice back in Sarnia. Should it go the other way, then it'll be Beaulieu wearing a Russian jersey that he says Yakupov will be obliged to supply – if it comes to that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beaulieu says he made the proposal to Yakupov, the highly regarded prospect who is favoured to go first overall in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s next entry draft, before a practice a few weeks back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We were skating alongside each other and I said to him, ‘Go Canada Go.' And then I told him to keep his head up against Canada,” said Beaulieu, with a laugh. “That's how it started.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russia qualified for the semi-finals with a 2-1 overtime victory over the Czech Republic on Monday night, setting the stage for the much-anticipated rematch of last year's tournament final, won by the Russians in dramatic come-from-behind fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yakupov is much watched by <span class="companylink">NHL</span> scouts, but his performance here is a reminder that no matter what a player's pedigree or upside may be, the world under-20 championship is a tournament for 19-year-olds. Evgeny Kuznetsov, the team captain and the player who managed a nine-point night against Latvia in the preliminary round, is far and away Russia's best player.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">NHL</span> scouts are in the business of extrapolating what someone's raw talent is two years down the road, which is why Yakupov is so fascinating. But in terms of a game plan to win Tuesday's game and move on to play for the gold medal, Canada needs to find a way of neutralizing a few players.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They include Kuznetsov, the Quebec Remparts' Mikhail Grigorenko, and all the rest. Kuznetsov already plays in the KHL and as a Washington Capitals' draft choice, could be in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>, playing alongside Alex Ovechkin as early as next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Yakupov? Even as Canada seeks revenge for last year's jarring loss, Yakupov's <span class="companylink">NHL</span> rights are up for grabs, which is why there is so much fascination over this, his first tentative steps on the big stage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beaulieu is a fan – except maybe Tuesday night – and notes that during his days on Dale Hunter's staff in London, he's coached players from Rick Nash to Corey Perry. Yakupov, he believes, is special in the same way Nash and Perry are special.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He's dynamic on the ice. His skating is incredible. His edges are really good. His hockey sense is good. The only thing that's going to stop Nail from playing in the <span class="companylink">National Hockey League</span> next year is if he doesn't pay attention to details on defence,” Beaulieu said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But he's very enthusiastic; he's got a good sense of humour; and his teammates love him.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For his part, Yakupov says he's happy to be part of the Russian squad, playing with his “buddies” again. As for the draft, that is something he doesn't like to talk about it. Sensibly, he makes the point that the draft is in June, the world juniors are now, so the draft can wait.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus far in the tournament, Canada's goaltending has been solid; the scoring balanced; and the discipline more or less intact. Jonathan Huberdeau is showing no ill effects from the ankle injury that cost him a month of the QJMHL season and even the loss of Devante Smith-Pelly early on hasn't set them back as much as one might have thought, with others – notably Boone Jenner – stepping up to provide a physical presence. As long as the flu bug that waylaid coaches Don Hay and Scott Walker on Monday stays out of the dressing room, they are as ready as they can be for the semis.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wearing corduroy and khaki, Wade Davis, Canada's famous anthropologist and ethnobotanist, sweeps into a Toronto café and launches into a conversation about his latest book, Into the Silence: The Great War, Mallory, and the Conquest of Everest, as though it's a great adventure from which he has only recently returned. The only thing missing is a rakish hat atop his dark blond hair and handsome, weather-beaten face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This adventurer is a photographer, award-winning filmmaker, author and scientist who has left few of the world's cultural corners unexplored. And all because he grew up in Pointe Claire, an Anglo suburb of Montreal, where “the bourgeois blanket of banality” fuelled his desire to escape. His father was an investment adviser with Royal Trust. “He talked about it being the grind. He got smaller every day,” Mr. Davis says. As a teen, “I desperately needed to know what I was going to do with myself.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not surprising that an anthropologist – whose curiosity about human cultural diversity earned him an explorer-in-residence position at the National Geographic Society – should take an interest in the practices of his own tribe, even though he rejected them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Understanding the difficulty in surmounting the influences of one's culture, he is quick to offer insight to young people who seek him out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only right career choice is to “follow your heart,” he avers. “A career is not something that you put on like a coat. It is something that grows organically around you, step by step, choice by choice, experience by experience,” he wrote as part of a commencement address at Colorado College in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Harvard University, he trusted the whim of his intuition. He had planned to study history and law. But then, on the day before he had to declare his major, he ran into a friend who was studying anthropology. He was intrigued, so he chose that. For a postgraduate degree, he followed an interest in ethnobotany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have never had a job,” says the 58-year-old father of two girls, now in their 20s. “… Creativity is not the motivation for action. It's the consequence of action … You have to put yourself in the way of opportunities and what happens is that you find yourself. Suddenly you're doing things that were not imaginable a couple of years before.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 20, he walked across the Darien Gap, a swampland in Central America, in the company of celebrated English author Sebastian Snow. In 1996, his book One River documented his expedition with his mentor, Richard Schultes, into the shamanistic culture of the Amazon rain forest. He investigated Haitian folk preparations in the creation of zombies in his 1985 book The Serpent and the Rainbow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Into the Silence explores the culture of British men at the turn of the 20th century, as much as it delves into the challenging environment of Mount Everest for early climbers, many of whom felt oxygen supplements were “unsporting.” Between 1921 and 1924, there were three epic attempts to scale Everest. Mystery had always surrounded the 1924 disappearance of George Mallory and Andrew Irvine, last sighted a few hundred metres from the summit. Did they reach the top before they died? It was not until 1953 that New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary made history for conquering Everest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was truly and sincerely not interested in whether Mallory got to the top or not [a continuing debate]. I wanted to know who these men were,” says the author, seated sideways in a chair, as though he's ready to leap from it. “They were not cavalier about death. But their attitude about death had changed because of the First World War. That was my intuition from the start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“How could there not be a war angle?” he asks. “Twenty of the 26 men had endured the worst of the war. You just had to look at their age, their class, their education. They personified the Lost Generation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inspiration had come while doing what anthropological adventurers do – he was photographing snow leopards in Tibet in the fall of 1996 with his friend and fellow adventurer Dan Taylor, who was lamenting the commercialization of Mount Everest in the wake of a disaster that saw eight climbers die, later chronicled in Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air. Caught in a snow squall, Mr. Taylor regaled Mr. Davis with tales of British explorers from yesteryear who wore tweeds and read Shakespeare aloud in their tents at 20,000 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just a few months before the discovery of Mr. Mallory's body electrified the world in 1999, Mr. Davis had signed his book contract. Within months, several books had been published. “The discovery of Mallory's body forced me to take the story to a whole other level,” Mr. Davis says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Into the Silence is a compelling read of remarkable scope that took 12 years to complete. He keeps his readers roped to the page with fascinating depictions of some of the characters and a detailed geopolitical context of the Raj and Tibet. The idea of climbing Everest had come out of the Great Trigonometric Survey of India, which confirmed it as the highest peak and led to its naming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Davis is a rumpled heap of enthusiasm, pulling out facts from his brain like trinkets from his pocket. On that third expedition, the men brought 60 tins of quail and foie gras and 48 bottles of Champagne, Montebello 1915. The men were the product of a bohemian period. “There was this promise of a new century. It wasn't just the old Victorian guard … These were men who believed in patriotism, who had faith in the future of the world.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think of myself as an entrepreneur of knowledge,” Mr. Davis says. “I haven't taken a week off for 15 years … People are often saying to me, ‘Oh, you know so much.'

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the positive spirit of the New Year, it's worth noting that some exciting things are happening in the world of Toronto transit.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The long-delayed renovation of Union Station, the city's biggest transit hub, is well under way. Early work is beginning on the air-rail link between Pearson airport and Union Station, which will give Toronto something that other leading cities have had for years: a direct train route from airport to downtown and back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New, dedicated bus lanes are being built in York and Mississauga to speed commuters through heavy suburban traffic. Premier Dalton McGuinty has promised to bring all-day service to the GO train system. The <span class="companylink">Toronto Transit Commission</span> has agreed to adopt the Presto smart card payment system, already rolling out on the GO network and suburban transit services. And work continues on the northward extension of the Spadina subway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most ambitious of all is the Eglinton-Scarborough Crosstown Project, a new 25-kilometre light-rail transit line that will take riders from Black Creek Drive to Scarborough city centre. A new report says the $8.2-billion line is the most expensive infrastructure project in all of Canada. In its annual report on the country's top 100 infrastructure projects, ReNew magazine pegged the Crosstown at No. 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction is already in progress. Workers are digging a giant hole near Black Creek and Eglinton. Massive boring machines will be lowered into it to begin tunnelling for the underground stretch of the line. Metrolinx, the regional transit agency, expects it to open by 2020. ReNew calls it “one of the largest public transit investments in Canadian history.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this has to be encouraging for hard-pressed Toronto commuters, who have waited decades for serious expansion of the transit network. The Yonge subway line opened in 1954, the University line in 1963, the Bloor-Danforth line in 1966, the Spadina line in 1978 and the Scarborough RT in 1985. Since then, the only new line has been the five-station Sheppard “stubway” in 2002. Even as the population boomed with the arrival of hundreds of thousands of new immigrants, the transit build-out stalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, at long last, things are happening – and about time, too. Demand for transit is rising fast, with more than 500 million riders expected to take the TTC this year, a new record. The city has a chance to catch up for years of transit delay and neglect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But given Toronto's sad history of stop-and-start transit planning, it's only reasonable to wonder whether it will all unfold just as planned. A previous attempt to build an Eglinton subway fell apart when Premier Mike Harris cancelled it to save money. Then, as now, the provincial government faced a massive budget deficit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big-ticket transit projects make easy targets for budget cutters. Don't forget that the McGuinty government itself delayed billions in funding for the Transit City light-rail project, later killed by Mayor Rob Ford. With credit-rating agencies breathing down its neck, will it be tempted to pull back funding for the Crosstown?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ford forced up the cost of the line by around $2-billion when he insisted that most of it travel underground, even the stretch along the eastern reaches of Eglinton that was supposed to go on the surface under the initial plan. For that reason, the project moved from No. 4 to No. 1 on ReNew's top 100 infrastructure list. Queen's Park bean counters may wonder whether going back to Plan A wouldn't make more sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another big question mark floats over Mr. Ford's cherished Sheppard subway extension. Because all or most of the money from Transit City is now going to build the Crosstown, a provincial project, no one quite knows how Sheppard is going to be financed, if it happens at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it goes in the world of Toronto transit. Good news for the present, yes, but reasons for worry about the future.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's hasn't had many prime ministers who were good at sports or who exhibited unusual interest in athletics. None, for example, has shown Stephen Harper's passion for hockey – or his smarts in using it to political advantage.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lester Pearson was an accomplished amateur hockey player. After attending Oxford in the early 1920s, he was invited to play for England in the 1924 Olympics in Chamonix, France, but by that time had teaching commitments back in Canada. As prime minister, though, he never played up his hockey pedigree. “Mike” was a baseball nut. He spent more time talking baseball than hockey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pierre Trudeau, as we know, was never much of a team guy. He was proficient at individual sports, such as canoeing, diving and sliding down banisters. But while he attended the odd hockey game for public-relations purposes, he could barely tell a hockey stick from a tennis racket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jean Chrétien was quite athletic. A good golfer and a decent hockey player, he was quick with the elbows and liked to rough it up. Conservatives were of the view that he governed with concussion-like symptoms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Louis St. Laurent wasn't much of a sportsman, at least not as prime minister. By that time, as one smart aleck put it, he could get winded playing chess. John Diefenbaker, with that boulder-sized head pitching to and fro, was as awkward as they come. And Joe Clark? Well, no one ever described him as athletically gifted. Once while inspecting an honour guard in some far-off land, he stumbled, almost impaling himself on a bayonet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naturally, those prime ministers liked to be on hand at big sporting events to share in the glory. But, by and large, they were wary of mixing politics and sport. The fear was that fans would see it as a crass attempt at vote-getting. Many a dignitary has been introduced at a game only to hear the boos rain down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Harper is changing the sports-politics dynamic. He is moving big-time into our hockey space. He's on hockey platforms, promoting the sport, every chance he gets. His government renovates rinks across the land, gives tax credits for kids' hockey equipment. And soon, the big deal: He's bringing out his very own hockey book, a volume on professional hockey in its early days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's all part of his populist pitch, the new patriotism he is trying to instill. It's also a personal image enhancer. As Prime Minister, he has found it hard to connect on a personal level. What better way than being the hockey prime minister? The country, egged on by saturation media coverage, is overdosing on the sport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Speaking of which, the world junior hockey tournament is a great tradition – but front-page coverage of victories in the preliminary round? One paper war-headlined a win over Denmark! Are we that desperate to cheer for ourselves? Is there any of that good old Canadian modesty left?)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harper, it should be said, comes by his hockey interest honestly. Always passionate about the sport, he has hockey trivia contests in his office. His book is a great idea – it will give him more hockey credibility than he has as a mere fan. At the sales counter, it can't lose. Every party member will be expected to buy it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the Prime Minister's analytical mind, the book promises to be a good one. Books on modern hockey are plentiful, but there are relatively few about the old days. I have a particular interest myself because I wrote a book, The Red Machine, on the history of Russian hockey. No doubt Mr. Harper has been using it as a source book. (Jesting!)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, some grouse that he's exploiting the national game for political gain. Other PMs didn't do that, they say. But given how it appears to be working for him, they may have been missing something.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a new U.S. network sitcom starting tonight, a seemingly slight show about a couple of guys – real men's-men types – who dress up as women in order to land jobs.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show is Work It (ABC, CITY-TV, 8:30 p.m.) and it is simultaneously hokey and crudely funny. It might last six weeks. It might last six years. But in the way that television shows will casually and lavishly illuminate the culture, this silly show arrives on the perfect day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tonight also begins the great American political drama that unfolds every four years. Chapter one of this edition of the drama begins with the Iowa caucuses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CNN is calling its coverage “American Choice 2012: Iowa Caucuses” and it runs from 7 p.m. to midnight, but really the coverage will last all day long. Fox News calls its special newscast “America's Election HQ: Iowa Caucuses” and airs it from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m., but it too will be dwelling on Iowa all day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An intriguing portion of the U.S. culture will come into focus by tonight. The Republican race, which has been going on for many months, thanks to countless TV debates, has seemed anarchic. Leading candidates and their positions have soared in popularity and then evaporated in a harum-scarum way. Far as I can tell, television is at the core of everything. It seems the key Iowa race has three main components for the candidates: meet-and-greets with voters, TV appearances and TV ads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TV ads – which are easily found online – are fascinating. Rick Santorum, who has suddenly emerged as a leading candidate, has been running TV spots that look like promos for the NBC series Parenthood. One has the impression the guy has about 14 kids and spends all his time throwing around a football with them when he's not busy gazing at the sky awaiting the word of God. And if you want a clue about the recent collapse in support for Newt Gingrich, check out a negative ad run by the campaign of Ron Paul, which roasts Gingrich for “serial hypocrisy.” A recent report by CNN estimated that five anti-Gingrich ads from other candidates and their supporters have been running every day in the last few weeks in Iowa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The context of the Iowa caucuses is mind-boggling. Look at the year just ended – the Occupy movement, the eurozone's near-collapse, the Arab Spring, the U.S. economy solidly stalled, the ranting about the 1 per cent and the 99 per cent. What meat there is for politicians and pundits who want Barack Obama defeated. What material for rocking TV coverage of the race for the Republican nomination and then the big battle in the fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet, watching the Republican race unfold, leading up to the Iowa vote today, it all seems bizarrely disconnected from reality. Arguments between candidates have focused on issues meant only to rally deeply conservative voters. The issues seem to be abortion, same-sex marriage, gun rights, immigration law, devotion to church and biblical interpretation of everything from health care to divorce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Work It presents a rather different United States. Here's ABC's synopsis: “Looking for a job in today's economy can be a real drag. Take Lee Standish (Ben Koldyke), one-time breadwinner and current unemployment statistic. After being laid off, Lee will do anything it takes to support his family – even if it means putting on a skirt and heels.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the moment, Work It is stirring some debate about whether it might be offensive to the transgender community. In the peculiar way that the U.S. media culture works, this point of view on a TV show is the dominant one. It's all about somebody being offended and the opportunity to attack the Hollywood entertainment industry for being insensitive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The issue is phony, utter nonsense and a distraction. Work It is a broad comedy, more in the British TV style than the American tradition. What matters is that it presents a contrarian narrative to what has emerged in the build-up to the Iowa caucuses. Two beefy guys who once had jobs at a Pontiac dealership dress as women to land jobs selling pharmaceuticals. It's jobs and work that matter. The characters are desperate to find work, any kind of work. Under the crude comedy, there's desperation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's the economy, stupid” was the phrase that emerged from Bill Clinton's winning 1992 presidential campaign against George H. W. Bush. For all of Bush's perceived strengths, the Clinton campaign knew that it was the recession economy that really worried voters. And now, while the Republican candidates continue to natter about preposterous concerns and TV pundits engage in intense debate about evangelical voters, it looks like 1992 all over again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, seemingly silly TV shows say more than months of political coverage on the U.S. all-news channels. Biblical interpretations. Yeah, right. Jesus wept.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Financial Planning Standards Council, only about one in five Canadians has a financial plan. Perhaps some people feel intimidated by the thought of a binder full of charts and advice written in incomprehensible jargon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luckily, the size of your financial plan correlates fairly well with your age. If you're younger and just starting out, it might simply be a few pages showing you how to disaster-proof your life, run a surplus and pay down high-interest debt. Ideally, you'll want to look for an adviser with a Certified Financial Planner designation. Many get paid through the products they provide, but more and more are offering hourly or flat rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As they say, if you fail to plan, plan to fail. And if you are one of the few Canadians who actually has a financial plan, don't forget to review it to make sure you are on track or to incorporate any changes in your situation or goals.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘Hello, everybody. This is Mrs. Russell Brand.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before they announced their impending divorce last week, one had expected to hear Katy Perry say this toward the end of her California Dreams tour, tears coursing down her face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a while, Perry and Brand, married just 14 months and separated by almost ten years (she is 27, he is 36) were looking more and more like the Blodgett-Maines in A Star Is Born: like a washed-out star watching his ingénue wife get bigger each day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Brand started dating Perry, he was in the middle of his crossover, from established English success – as a comic, writer, actor and radio personality/provocateur (and, three years in a row, the Sun's Shagger of the Year) – to larger, more desirable, American fame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More desirable because of the money and vastness of the fame. And because British popularity is so insular, it is barely possible to explain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider Brand's notorious prank calls with Jonathan Ross to actor Andrew Sachs on BBC Radio 2 back in 2008. It's impossible to say if the calls are funny, given the anguish involved in establishing the back-story: Who called who? Why? What does “barmy” mean?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brand displayed his ambiguous yearning for super-stardom in 2007's Russell Brand On the Road, a BBC Four documentary which follows the comic on a pilgrimage after Kerouac's journey in On the Road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The documentary is irreverent and funny, yet awkward. Brand can't seem to manage the tension between his actual intellectual respect for the writer and his constant, antic desire to mock everything and everyone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time Brand was dancing on Kerouac's grave in the series, though, he had released his greatly successful memoir My Booky Wook – an exceptionally candid account of his life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It spares no detail of his heroin addiction (he has been clean for nine years), sexual profligacy and what is clearly monstrous, well-managed depression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he was poised, in 2008's Forgetting Sarah Marshall, to play Aldous Snow, the absurd, charismatic rock star who may as well be Brand playing, and parodying, himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The role brought him real fame, and, after a number of mini-scandals (including his inane and appalling reference to George W. Bush on the MTV Awards as a “retarded cowboy fella”), a meeting with Katy Perry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They met in 2009 when she filmed a scene (that was cut) for Get Him to the Greek, an Aldous Snow-only film, which delves more deeply into the character's addiction and despair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The movie did well, but Brand was overlooked critically: The scene in which he confesses to the walking punchline Jonah Hill that he is frightened and “lonely” is as wrenching as Bill Murray's similar revelation – while smoking two cigarettes and drinking from a flask in a hospital elevator – in Rushmore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Brand's willingness, through Aldous Snow, to take his charm away, layer by layer, is an intriguing and powerful striptease which shows us what charm is – that it is the most potent when used by dissembling, cruel and broken people. This role should have moved him forward fast. And Katy Perry, then a still-rising pop star should have stayed still, sitting in fields of flowers and marvelling about girl-kissing and gay-jerk boyfriends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even as they moved across the Ranthambore tiger-sanctuary grounds on gaudy elephants on their wedding day in Rajasthan in October of 2010 the tides were turning. Brand's major projects that year were a remake of Arthur and the release of Booky Wook 2: This Time It's Personal. Perry released Teenage Dream, her third record. The rest is history as directed by George Cukor (or Frank Pierson, should you prefer the Streisand/Kristofferson version).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brand's poorly written book flopped, as did his film. The reviews were so cruel as to smack of vindictiveness: Was the Brit already wearing out his welcome?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile Teenage Dream, a loud, confectionery, conceptually brilliant firework (Perry's makes canny use of other artists and sounds and pinpoints her teen-girl demographics' likes, dislikes, fears and dreams) continues to break records and soar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perry's gospel roots inform her music perfectly. Her message, that the abject, the “waste[s] of space” are “original,” and loaded with possibilities, that life is fun and funny, is simple, yes, but redemptive and unabashedly positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After news of the divorce broke, sexist speculation started to run toward Perry (like Jennifer Aniston) choosing her career over a family. That doesn't sound right. Much more like Lady Diana, Perry became too big for Brand, or maybe, too young and happy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has been seen brooding in dark glasses; she has been seen in Hawaii, playing in the sea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both seem happy, in their way. And as distant, looking back, as the waning moon and the rising sun.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The past few years have been marked by a lot of anxiety over the U.S. jobs market. And without question, it's in a truly sorry state. For the better part of three years, the unemployment rate has been stuck above 9 per cent – and the recent dip to 8.6 per cent was really about discouraged workers dropping out of the job hunt.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is there hope for American workers? You bet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the reasons why so many Americans are jobless has to do with the U.S. government's extension of unemployment benefits. Through Washington's fiscal stimulus packages a few years ago, the maximum number of weeks of benefits was raised far beyond the standard 26 weeks. But once benefits eventually start expiring, millions of Americans will suddenly be less choosy about their employment options. Desperation will kick in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, there aren't too many jobs available, so very low-skill, unappealing jobs – pizza delivery, gas station attendant, etc. – will be reconsidered. Skilled Americans accustomed to much higher wages will find themselves accepting these jobs. On the surface, that's bad news. What a waste of education and skill!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But within the husk of underemployment lie the seeds of a whole new wave of innovation and creativity. Smart workers in these menial jobs will say, “I could do better” or “I can do this differently” or “I have an idea that will revolutionize pizza delivery.” New businesses will be created, many improving on the old business models that dominated the pre-Internet age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is how economic innovation works. Clever people come up with ideas, which turn into business ventures, which then turn into the economic drivers of tomorrow. Giants of corporate America – Apple, <span class="companylink">FedEx</span>, <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>, <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> – were all born out of the inkling that there must be a better way to do things. Sometimes innovation needs a jump-start, and the fact that millions of Americans will find themselves in low-paying jobs in 2012 will be the spark that innovation needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skeptics will point to a lot of potential barriers that will stand in the way of these would-be innovators. Crushing household debt will restrict access to small business credit. U.S. educational achievement is not keeping pace with China and India. The political system is broken. All of these factors may be true, but nothing can stand in the way of entrepreneurial vigour – particularly the U.S. variety, which has propelled nearly 250 years of innovation. Call it greed or call it ambition, but it's in America's DNA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The skeptics will also be quick to point out that most new business ideas fail, which is true. But they won't all fail, and that's the beauty of innovation and entrepreneurialism. Only some need to succeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anxiety about where future jobs will come from is common. In every downturn, folks worry themselves sick trying to prevent jobs from disappearing. It's almost useless to try – and indeed, it's a good thing job preservation strategies don't really work. If they did, most of us would still be in agriculture, plowing fields in the hot sun with horses. What they couldn't foresee a century ago were jobs that hadn't even been invented yet: lab technician, human resource specialist, fibre-optic cable engineer, web designer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the long, sluggish, “non-recovery” grinds on and unemployment benefits expire, Americans will finally get fed up. Like pine cones that need the intense heat of a forest fire to release their seeds, American entrepreneurial spirit needs the drudgery of delivering pizzas before it's released in a whole new way. Creativity thrives in adversity.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just after Christmas, Alberta Health and Wellness Minister Fred Horne ordered a review of diagnostic imaging and pathology testing in the province. He made the move in response to revelations of systemic errors – most of them affecting the treatment of cancer patients – at hospitals in Calgary, Edmonton and Drumheller. In recent years, there have been similar scandals in British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a disturbing pattern that should concern patients, physicians and administrators alike. That's because about 80 per cent of medical treatment decisions depend, to some extent, on pathology tests. This is basic stuff and we need to get them right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The solution is not to ask: What's wrong with medical testing in Canada? It's to get Alberta to read and act on the reports produced by other provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two most thorough were done by Mr. Justice Paul Creaghan and Madam Justice Margaret Cameron, who headed public inquiries in New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, in a nutshell, is what they tell us:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• There is a shortage of pathologists due to the mounting number and complexity of tests;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• The shortage has led to the hiring of people with dubious credentials and some pathologists keeping their jobs despite obvious failings;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• The technology has changed a lot in recent years, but some pathologists have not kept pace; this is due, at least in part, to a lack of investment in professional development and training;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• There are no national standards; standards vary from province to province, and sometimes from one lab to the next;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Quality assurance programs are grossly lacking; auditing and systematic retesting to ensure accuracy too rarely occur;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• There is little oversight of laboratories, particularly by provincial ministries of health;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• When there are errors, there is little accountability; the disciplinary process is weak;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• In short, if you want better pathology, you need better people and better rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been some action in response to these reports, notably the creation, in November, 2010, of the Canadian Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Leadership Council. The CPLMLC is developing national standards but – in true Canadian fashion – its recommendations are not binding on the provinces and it has no regulatory authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other response from provinces where the scandals have been politically damaging has been to hike the salaries of pathologists in a bid to attract employees. (Read: Poach them from other jurisdictions.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than dwell on the details of these individual scandals and the inadequate response of health and political leaders, let's take a moment to ponder what these problems tell us about our health system writ large.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The failings in pathology should not be dismissed as isolated woes; if anything, they are by-products of poor management practices on a larger scale and our failure to ask some fundamental questions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canadian health care, whenever a problem arises, our response is always the same: Throw more money and more bodies at the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The screw-ups in pathology have been blamed principally on a shortage of pathologists and overwork. They are no doubt a contributing factor. Caseloads were up 17 per cent in the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But do we ever step back and ask if we really need to do all the tests we are doing? Does all the work have to be done by a highly paid pathologist or can we hive off some routine tasks to pathology assistants? Does every hospital need a lab that does a full range of tests, or should they centralize and specialize?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are so many vested interests, so much turf protection in health care, that it's hard to do things differently, no matter how inefficient and harmful the status quo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where is the accountability? In two of the incidents – Ontario and New Brunswick – pathologists who committed errors were clearly not fit to practice; they suffered cataracts that gravely impaired their vision. But their colleagues never ratted them out and they were not subject to mandatory recertification. Why do we have tougher rules for forklift operators than physicians?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much has been made of the fact that there are no national standards in pathology. But lack of standards is not unique to this area. We see manyfold variations in rates of routine testing and surgical procedures between provinces and even between regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why does this happen? Canada has a wealth of data but makes very poor use of that information to guide policies. There is a shameful lack of shared learning, which is why you end up with near-identical pathology scandals in seven provinces. Their repetitive nature also serves as a reminder that we are far too reactive and not nearly pro-active enough in health administration. Why, for example, is Alberta only reviewing its lab services now? Did the failing in six other provinces not set off some alarm bells?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lack of quality assurance was the essence of the pathology scandals: It's why some patients' cancer diagnoses were missed and why others were treated unnecessarily. But quality is about a lot more than double-checking to catch errors. It's a philosophy, a state of mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada, we don't have a culture that says quality and patient safety are paramount. Until that mindset changes, we will continue to have scandals, in pathology and elsewhere, and we will have suboptimal care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As is your pathology, so is your medicine,” said the legendary physician Sir William Osler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pathology is in a sorry state in Canada. That tells us that medicine has some pretty fundamental problems too. We don't need to fix pathology in isolation, we need to fundamentally change our philosophy of health-care delivery.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The city has attracted people who like what they find and want to keep it that way,” said Nick Russell, the journalist and heritage researcher who produced the book. “A lot of people move here and stay because they love the ambience.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His research has found worthy homes in all corners of the city, including a cottage along the harbour waterfront that is all but invisible from the street, hidden as it is behind a curtain of trees. It can be spotted from the water if one looks down from the deck of the passing MV Coho ferry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His favourite street for house sightseeing will come as little surprise to anyone familiar with the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I still get a frisson of pleasure driving up Rockland where there are so many glorious, classic buildings from 1910, 1912, and where you also come across ultra-modern buildings, which are exciting architecture in their own right. I like that mix.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Russell, 73, has renovated two houses since moving to Victoria from Regina more than a decade ago. The first was a homestead-style house covered in stucco and in disrepair as a long-time rental. During the renovation, it was learned the house dated not from 1900, as thought, but from 1861, when it was built for one of the first African-American families lured to the colony by Governor James Douglas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second is his current home in the James Bay neighbourhood. It is known as the Mansard House for its roofline, an uncommon style in Victoria. He did not include it in his self-published book, as the house once had been lifted to make room for a full basement, losing the original integrity of the design. He and his wife, Sharon, worked on the restoration, which received an award from the local Hallmark Heritage Society.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The long-time reporter and educator trained many of the reporters whose bylines can be read in British Columbia newspapers. As well, he wrote Morals and the Media, a book on ethics in journalism. (Insert your own wisecrack here.) He was senior editor of This Old House, a four-volume register of Victoria's historic homes produced by the Victoria Heritage Foundation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working with other researchers, Mr. Russell picked through the detritus of city hall's attic and found dusty ledgers with valuable information for those interested in researching house histories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, he has gathered 3,600 plumbing permits, 6,450 water permits and 8,218 building permits, a dreary accumulation of data for the uninitiated but a trove of detail for researchers. The goal is to have this information made available online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An advocate of preservation, Mr. Russell does not want Victoria to become a time capsule. A city is living space for people, he notes, not a museum.</p>

Ltd</span>. of 100 per cent of the MacKay River oil-sands project is a vivid reminder that the federal government's review of Investment Canada's foreign-takeover criteria has not yet been issued – more than a year after the messy episode in which <span class="companylink">BHP Billiton</span> was not allowed to proceed with its bid for <span class="companylink">Potash Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, Tony Clement, who was then the minister of industry, approved this same <span class="companylink">PetroChina</span> acquisition two years ago – because the transaction already included an option to turn a 60-per-cent interest into sole ownership, and it was <span class="companylink">Athabasca Oil Sands Corp</span>., not <span class="companylink">PetroChina</span>, that exercised its option – to sell, that is.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government has sent mixed signals over the years. In 2007, it introduced new rules for state-controlled foreign companies so that they would do business on commercial principles, rather than as agents of their home country's policies. And in the 2008 election, the Conservatives said they would not permit the exports of bitumen from the oil sands for processing elsewhere – which might be justifiable on commercial grounds. On the other hand, the proposed Northern Gateway Pipeline, which the government favours, would facilitate the exporting of that same bitumen to China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, after two delays in the Investment Canada review – but apparently not because of those delays – <span class="companylink">PetroChina</span> withdrew from a joint venture in British Columbian natural gas. The Chinese company seems to have decided the price was too high. Even so, the government's processes may have given <span class="companylink">PetroChina</span> time to think better of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The MacKay River project is of course only one of many in the Alberta oil sands – unlike <span class="companylink">Potash Corp</span>.'s dominant position in Canadian potash mining, which evoked so much nationalism and populism in 2010. And <span class="companylink">PetroChina</span> remains obliged to do business in Canada as a commercial corporation, not as a state agency. But Christian Paradis, the Minister of Industry, should act soon to provide the promised clarity about what Canada expects from foreign investors.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KNOW YOUR NUTRITION / CHECK THE ANSWERS (AND YOUR SCORE) HERE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. b. Cream of Wheat is a refined cereal; it's made from the starchy endosperm of the wheat kernel with most of the germ and bran removed during processing. Instant oatmeal and granola are whole grain cereals – made from whole grain oat flakes. While 100 per cent bran cereal isn't technically a whole grain (the endosperm and germ have been removed), it's a concentrated source of bran missing from refined cereals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. False. Brown sugar is white sugar with molasses added, which results in a sugar that's light to dark brown. While molasses is a good source of minerals such as calcium, magnesium and potassium, the trace amount that ends up in a teaspoon of brown sugar is negligible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. a. The top sources of omega-3 fatty acids, DHA and EPA, include salmon, mackerel, herring, anchovy and sable fish. Here, Atlantic salmon wins, providing roughly 1,800 milligrams of DHA plus EPA per three ounces. Runners-up include trout (980 mg), and halibut (395 mg). Tilapia is low in omega-3s, with only 115 mg per three-ounce serving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts advise an intake of 500 to 1,000 mg of DHA plus EPA a day for heart health. Since omega-3 fats store in your body, eating three ounces of salmon a week provides roughly 260 mg a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. c. Black beans, gram for gram, have more antioxidant activity than any other bean, rivalling many fruits and vegetables. Black beans also supply nearly 40 per cent of your daily requirement for manganese, a mineral that's needed to make superoxide dismutase, a key antioxidant enzyme in your liver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. False. Quinoa, the seed of a grain-like crop grown in South America, is often touted as a high-protein food. By weight, raw quinoa is considerably higher in protein than many other grains (14 per cent protein by weight), but what ends up on your dinner plate has much less. A half-cup of cooked quinoa has 2.5 grams of protein, a little more than brown rice (1.7 grams). Other cooked whole grains, such as kamut and amaranth, have even more protein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bottom line: Choose quinoa for its whole-grain, fibre, magnesium and B vitamin content, not protein. It's also gluten-free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. False. Per cent daily values, or %DV – listed for fat, saturated plus trans fat, sodium, carbohydrate, fibre, vitamins A and C, calcium and iron – are based on average recommended intakes for a 2,000-calorie diet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the daily value for calcium is 1,100 milligrams. Read the label and you'll see that one serving (one cup) of milk supplies 30 per cent of the daily value for calcium, which means 330 mg of calcium (1,100 x 0.3 =330). It does not mean that milk is made up of 30 per cent calcium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Use the %DV to get a general idea of whether there's a little or a lot of a nutrient in one serving of a food. A daily value of 5 per cent or less means there's only a little of that nutrient – a good thing for sodium and saturated plus trans fats. A daily value of 15 per cent or greater means there's a lot of that nutrient – a good thing for fibre, calcium and vitamin C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">7. d. Most of us know that oranges are a great source of vitamin C: one medium orange has 70 mg. But half a papaya packs even more: 93 mg, more than a full day's worth. Half a grapefruit has 39 mg of vitamin C and the baked potato has 19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8. d. Vitamin B12 keeps nerves and blood cells healthy and helps make DNA, the genetic material of cells. Many older adults don't produce enough hydrochloric acid in their stomachs to properly absorb B12 from foods. That's why adults over 50 are advised to get the nutrient from a supplement or fortified foods such as soy beverages, some soy products. Both contain B12 in an absorbable form.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9. c. Cottage cheese provides the least amount of calcium at 69 mg per half cup. (Hard cheeses, such as cheddar, are excellent sources of calcium.) One cup of milk provides the most (300 to 330 mg), followed by the yogurt (235 mg) and cooked collard greens (133 mg).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10. False. The theory goes that eating five or six small meals of equal size each day will help your body burn more calories and fat compared to eating three square meals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet there's no consensus on which meal pattern is best for boosting metabolism, despite years of research. Most studies have shown that eating frequency has no effect on a person's overall metabolic rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether you eat three meals or six, weight loss comes down to how many calories you consume.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My advice: Divide your day's worth of calories into three meals and two snacks to keep your blood sugar stable and prevent becoming overly hungry and overeating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">11. b. Cooking it. Heat kills, whereas freezing only halts the growth of most bacteria. Foods are properly cooked when they are heated for a long enough time and at a high enough temperature to kill the harmful bacteria that cause food poisoning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the most reliable results use a digital-read meat thermometer. When using a microwave, cover food, stir and rotate to ensure even cooking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">12. True. To kill harmful bacteria in ground meat, burgers must be cooked properly. To make sure burgers are safe to eat, you must test each one with a thermometer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cook beef burgers to an internal temperature of 71 C (160 F). You can't judge by colour – beef patties may be brown in the centre before reaching a safe temperature, or may stay pink even after reaching the right temperature.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenge, they say, is a dish best served cold – and if that is truly the case, then Canada will get a chance to exact its revenge on Russia in 12 months time, when the Russians take a rare turn at playing host for the 2013 world junior championship in Ufa, where temperatures can really drop in January.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unhappily, Canada was seeking its pound of flesh far sooner – this year, right now – and, oh boy, what a night and what a way to come up just a fraction short. After losing the gold-medal game to Russia last year with an epic third-period collapse, and falling behind 6-1 Tuesday night, the Canadians almost came up with their own epic comeback, before ultimately falling 6-5 to the Russians in a heartbreaker of a semi-final at the Scotiabank Saddledome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For anyone wondering what makes the world junior tournament so compelling, this game was exhibits A to Z. It had everything and proved once again that tournament play is just different than league play – or traditional North American playoff action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every game after the round robin is a seventh game, a win-or-go-home scenario that can fuel such an extraordinary adrenalin rush that everything seems possible. With everything on the line, and the pressure cranked up to levels that they've never experienced before, the Canadian players played with a passion that they left nothing on the table, even when the game looked out of hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 6-1 down, they received goals from Brendan Gallagher, Jaden Schwartz, Dougie Hamilton and Brandon Gormley, driving Russia's starting goalie, 17-year-old sensation Andrei Vasilevski, from the nets. Andrei Makarov came in and, although the Canadians had numerous chances to get the tying goal past him, they couldn't conjure up one final miracle. In all, Canada fired 56 shots, compared to just 24 for Russia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was Canada's first official tournament appearance in Calgary, after winning its other four games in the tournament in Edmonton, and for the first 49 minutes it was not a performance for the ages. The goaltending, from both starter Scott Wedgewood and relief man Mark Visentin, was just so-so. Defensively, the Canadians broke down early and often, and ultimately, had no early answer for Russia's dynamic Evgeny Kuznetsov, who had a hat trick by the game's midpoint and finished with four points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, Canada's loss means Russia and Sweden will play for the gold medal Thursday in a rematch of what was the best game in the round robin – a 4-3 thriller, won by Sweden in overtime last Saturday night. The Canadians, anticlimactically, will face Finland, a team they drubbed 8-1 earlier in the tournament, for the unwelcome bronze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In each of the past 10 years, Canada has played in the gold-medal game, a remarkable stretch of consistency that came to an end against a Russian team whose trademark in recent years had been its fabulous finishes. On this night, however, it was all about its start. Playing for the second time in 24 hours, the Russians should theoretically have had fatigue in their legs, especially in a game played at a frantic pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, they took advantage of an early Canadian defensive miscue – a turnover in the offensive zone by Ryan Murray – to convert on a 3-on-1, Kuznetsov stealing the puck in the first place, dishing to Yakupov, and then scoring on a one-timer on the return pass. From there, after a handful of near misses by Canada's nervous-looking forwards, Russia made the score 2-0 on a power play, a long screened slap shot from the point by defenceman Nikita Nesterov that eluded Wedgewood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brett Connolly momentarily restored Canadian hope by scoring on a delayed penalty early in the second, but Kuznetsov responded with back-to-back goals to make the score 4-1. Wedgewood came out after getting creamed in the crease by Alexander Khokhlachev as the fourth goal went in. He gave up four goals on 13 shots. Khokhlachev added salt to the wound by scoring on the second shot against Visentin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For anyone that turned off their TV sets at 6-1, they missed a fabulous finish and another ratings bonanza for the rights holder, TSN, and is sure to create even more interest in the 2013 event, in which the Canadians will need to travel halfway around the world and play on the larger, international ice surfaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For once, they'll be able to play the underdog card in Russia. That was everybody else's trump card this time around and may be Canada's ace in the hole as they seek both redemption … and revenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An early turning point came with the shots 26-11 for Canada early in the second period. A rising wrist shot by Russia's Evgeny Kuznetsov handcuffed Canadian goaltender Scott Wedgewood and restored their two-goal lead, just as Canada was pushing back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The turning point</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada had a 74-second two-man advantage late in the opening period down by two, but couldn't generate a decent chance – and then lost the opportunity altogether when Dougie Hamilton took a high-sticking minor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The comeback</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada saved the best for last when, trailing 6-1, it rattled off four consecutive goals in the third period, got it to 6-5 and drove starter Andrei Vasilevski from the net. There were multiple close calls in the final seconds, but none escaped the relief man, Andrei Makarov.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So many great cookbooks came out last year that it is hard to choose a favourite. Instead, I have chosen three top-notch recipes that I love for their ease of preparation, fantastic taste and twist on tradition.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ed Levine's</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chocolate-Chip Cookies</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his travel guide/cookbook /restaurant guide, Serious Eats: A Comprehensive Guide to Making and Delicious Food Wherever You Are, Ed Levine delves into everything from pizza ovens to chocolate chip cookies. He writes, “We all agreed that our recipe had to produce chocolate-chip cookies that were crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside, have the right chocolate-to-dough ratio, have a distinct but not overwhelming buttery flavour, and taste almost as good six hours later as they did right out of the oven. And they had to have a little salty kick.” These cookies deliver on all counts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ingredients</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3½ cups (17.5 ounces) all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1½ teaspoons baking powder</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1¼ teaspoons baking soda</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1½ teaspoons coarse sea salt, plus additional coarse flaky sea salt for sprinkling lightly on cookies</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1½ cups unsalted butter, room temperature</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">12/3 cups (11.5 ounces) light brown sugar, packed</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 cup (7 ounces) granulated sugar</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2 eggs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5 (4-ounce) bars high-quality bittersweet chocolate, still in their wrappers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Method</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda and coarse sea salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Combine the butter and the sugars. Beat on medium speed with an electric mixer until light and airy, about 4 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, beating for 30 seconds after each addition to incorporate, and scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as necessary. Add the vanilla and whip for 30 more seconds to combine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and mix at low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using a heavy rolling pin or small skillet, repeatedly whack the chocolate bars (still in their wrappers) one at a time until they are broken into smaller chunks no larger than ½ inch. Unwrap the broken bars and add the broken chocolate, including smaller pieces and crumbs, to the dough bowl. When all five bars have been added to the bowl, mix on low speed until just combined, about 1 minute. The dough should end up looking light brown with larger chunks of chocolate dispersed throughout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cover dough and refrigerate until cold, at least 1 hour or overnight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjust two oven racks to the upper middle and lower middle positions and preheat the oven to 350 F. Roll half the dough into twelve 1¾-inch balls, approximately 3 tablespoons of dough in each. Place the balls 3 inches apart on two parchment-lined cookie sheets, six cookies per sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bake the cookies for 8 minutes, until they are completely spread out. Remove them from the oven and sprinkle each cookie with sea salt. Return the pans to the oven, rotating them from front to back and top to bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Continue baking until the cookies are golden around the edges but still soft in the centre, 6 to 8 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cool for 3 minutes, then slide the parchment, along with the cookies, onto two cooling racks while you cook the remaining 12 cookies. To store the cookies, allow them to completely cool, then place in a covered container at room temperature for up to three days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Makes 24 4-inch cookies</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heston Blumenthal's Sea Bass With Vanilla Butter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heston Blumenthal at Home is a cookbook for foodies, yet the mouthwatering recipes are well-chosen and not as daunting as you might think. This sea bass with vanilla butter is one of the easiest but delivers unbelievable flavour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fish fillets are so thin that they cook very quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you have a digital timer with an alarm, I recommend that you use it to ensure they don't overcook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ingredients</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Groundnut (peanut) or grapeseed oil</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4 Mediterranean sea bass fillets, skin on</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Salt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">40 g vanilla butter (¼ cup) (see recipe below)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Method</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cover the bottom of a frying pan with a thin layer of oil, and heat over a high heat until extremely hot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Season both sides of fish with salt and place skin-side down in the hot pan to crisp for 90 seconds. Place a lightweight object such as a ramekin on top of the fish to keep it from curling as it cooks. Flip the fish over for a further 60 seconds and remove the fillets from the pan straight onto the serving plates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Place 10 g (1 tbsp) of vanilla butter on top of each fillet. As the butter melts, spoon it over the fillets to coat. Serves 4.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Vanilla Butter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This butter is excellent with grilled or fried fish. Don't discard the vanilla pods after adding the seeds to the burner – you can use them as a flavouring for sugar or oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ingredients</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3 vanilla pods</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">125 g (½ cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Method</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Halve the vanilla pods lengthways and, using a teaspoon, scrape out the seeds. Mix the butter with the vanilla seeds, using a hand blender. Roll into a log and wrap in parchment paper or place in a bowl. Keep in the fridge until required (for up to a week), or freeze for a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joe Beef's Kale</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">for a Hangover</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Art of Living According to Joe Beef is such a joyous book, celebrating life and food with tongue-in-cheek humour. More than a cookbook, it is a memoir, a history of Montreal, tales of people, places and things with a little philosophy thrown in. It is completely irreverent. The quote with this recipe tells all. “We can't explain why this helps cure hangovers, but it does. It's like a vitamin with a sugar coating (the coating being the bacon and butter).”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ingredients</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Salt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 bunch kale, stems removed and roughly chopped</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4 slices bacon, cut into lardons</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 small onion, chopped</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 clove garlic, chopped</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">¼ cup (60 mL) dry white wine</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pepper</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 tablespoon unsalted butter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small squeeze of fresh lemon juice</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 egg (optional)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Method</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add kale and cook for 10 minutes, or until soft. Drain well and squeeze lightly. Transfer to a cutting board and chop finely. Set aside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a frying pan, fry bacon over medium-high heat for about 6 minutes, or until crisp. Add the onion and cook, stirring, for 3 to 4 minutes, or until translucent. Lower the fire to medium-low, add the garlic, and sweat for 1 minute. Add the kale, wine, and a pinch each of salt and pepper and cook for 3 to 4 minutes to blend the flavours. If the mixture looks really shiny, scoop out a little of the fat and add a bit of water, and then add the butter. Mix in the lemon juice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Move the bacon and kale mixture to a plate and fry an egg in the same pan. Serve the egg of top of the bacon and kale. Go to bed. Serves 4.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Skvorecky, who died on Tuesday at 87, and Vaclav Havel, the former Czech president who died last month, were central figures in the dissident literature that helped propel the downfall of Communism in the former Czechoslavakia and beyond.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Skvorecky's magnum opus was The Engineer of Human Souls, a phrase coined by Joseph Stalin to describe writers as instruments of the state, inspiring people to be what the state wanted them to be. Mr. Skvorecky, in his novel, gave the world the wise-cracking, jazz-loving, women-chasing Danny Smiricky – a writer, but no engineer. He was the rebellious answer to Stalin's totalitarian dream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suppressed in his native Czechoslovakia, Mr. Skvorecky (pronounced Shkvor-et-ski) left in 1969 and used the freedom he had as a citizen of Canada to write a shelf-full of books. He also, with his wife, Zdena Salivarova, started 68 Publishers in Toronto in 1971, and they published Mr. Havel, Milan Kundera and himself in their native Czech, work that was smuggled into Czechoslovakia and spearheaded a thriving underground literature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With touching sincerity, he expressed his gratitude to Canada for freedom. “There is beauty everywhere on earth, but there is more beauty in those places where one feels that sense of ease which comes from no longer having to put off one's dreams.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Skvorecky and Mr. Havel were giants and heroes – but very human ones. Mr. Skvorecky was a grown-up version of Smiricky, political by necessity, because to be a writer under totalitarianism, or in exile from it, meant an obligation to speak as a witness. Mr. Havel, an absurdist playwright and eloquent essayist who spent years in jail under a Soviet-backed Communist regime, spoke about the need to “live within the truth” as an “elementary starting point” for opposing totalitarianism. Dissent, he wrote, was in the “service of truth, the truthful life and the attempt to make for the genuine aims of life.” Mr. Havel served truth when to do so was a dangerous occupation, while the Canadian Mr. Skvorecky was creating a lasting testament to the genuine aims of life.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Republican A-team is closer to being a one-man franchise called Mitt Romney.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Iowa caucuses, the first hurdle in a quadrennial test of presidential potential, elevated a couple of prospects in Rick Santorum and Ron Paul. But they are so unready for prime time as to leave Mr. Romney with a fairly unobstructed path to the GOP nomination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With all but a handful of Iowa's precincts reporting on Tuesday night, Mr. Romney, Mr. Paul and Mr. Santorum were clustered at the top. Mr. Santorum and Mr. Romney were tied at 25 per cent. Mr. Paul had 21 per cent support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paul, the libertarian Texas congressman, proved his resilience in the face of recent attacks on his dovish foreign policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Santorum, an ex-senator from Pennsylvania, drew his strength from social conservatives, who signalled their desire to unite behind a single candidate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the overall result still suggests the anti-Romney forces in the GOP have plenty of gas in the tank, the former Massachusetts governor heads into the Jan. 10 primary in New Hampshire a stronger and more daunting front-runner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rivals once thought to be serious – Texas Governor Rick Perry and ex-House of Representatives speaker Newt Gingrich – turned out to be all bluster, no bite. Mr. Gingrich captured only about 13 per cent in Iowa. Mr. Perry got 10 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, who channelled the Iron Lady in a last-ditch effort to revive her prospects, fell on her sword. She picked up less than 6 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gingrich could still mount a comeback in South Carolina, which is neighbour to his native Georgia and where social conservatives loom large in the state's Jan. 21 primary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it will be a Himalayan climb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gingrich will likely use two weekend debates to go on the offensive against Mr. Romney. Reneging on his promise to stay positive, he unleashed his inner pit bull on Tuesday, going so far as to call the front-runner a “liar.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a time-tested ritual of American democracy, as Iowa Republicans gathered in 1,774 precincts on Tuesday night, they were fed sales pitches by so-called precinct captains representing each of the candidates. Most captains simply repeated the script sent out by their candidate's campaign headquarters. Others ad libbed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Washington has gone off the cliff on debt and we've got to get someone to get us back on path,” insisted Lee Stine, a retired trucker who spoke for Mr. Romney in Precinct 46. “He's electable. He's constantly outpolled Barack Obama. None of the others have.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surprisingly, Mr. Santorum's precinct captain spoke little of his candidate's stand on social issues, even though that had been the reason for his surging support among Iowa's evangelicals. He called himself a “true conservative warrior.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign of the disarray in the Bachmann and Perry campaigns, no one spoke on their behalf in Precinct 46. Of the 87 votes cast, they each got only three. Mr. Romney won the precinct with 33 votes. Mr. Paul and Mr. Santorum got 19 each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Iowa behind him, Mr. Romney must still work to close the enthusiasm gap that has dogged his candidacy, as grassroots Republicans question his authenticity. He has been haunted by footage from his 2002 gubernatorial run in which he described himself as both “moderate” and “progressive.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Romney took to Fox News early Tuesday to reassure Republicans in Iowa and elsewhere that he is “more conservative than I was 10 years ago.” He also sloughed off Mr. Gingrich's “liar” label, saying the former speaker “must be very angry.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Mr. Gingrich has taken the shots against him gracelessly. Though he vowed to refrain from negative attacks on his opponents – pledging to uphold Ronald Reagan's 11th commandment – he has been unable to hide his resentment toward Mr. Romney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, Mr. Gingrich accused Mr. Romney of lying when he claimed to have no influence over an organization supporting the ex-governor that spent millions on attack ads against Mr. Gingrich, who led the polls until the final stretch of the campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If anything, the resurfacing of Mr. Gingrich's snarly side illustrates, as much as any attack ad, why his campaign has been in a freefall. Despite levelling some of the most acid attacks in the annals of U.S. politics, he remains as thin-skinned as a political novice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The attacks against Mr. Gingrich, while devastating, were hardly nasty by the standards of U.S. political advertising. Yet, the ex-speaker whined about being “Romney-boated” – laughably comparing his plight to that of the “swift-boated” John Kerry in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like it or not, negative ads remain the jigsaw in the American political toolkit. There will be plenty more of them to come, if not in the Republican race, in the colossal battle between the eventual the GOP nominee and President Barack Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Romney demonstrated anything in Iowa, it is that he has the money, organization and discipline to take on a rival of Mr. Obama's talent, team, timber and, oh yes, money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rest of the GOP primary contest will determine whether he has the presence, personality and policies to capture not only his party, but the nation.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Political science professor at the University of Toronto</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP leadership race presents, in many respects, a déjà vu experience. For more than 30 years, candidates for the federal party's top job have claimed they could win support in Quebec, unite urban and rural constituencies across the country, and push the Liberals to the margins of national politics.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What makes this campaign distinctive is the candidacy of two women MPs, Peggy Nash and Niki Ashton, for the leadership of a party that has already had two female leaders. The NDP stands out in international terms not only for Audrey McLaughlin and Alexa McDonough's successive terms at the helm between 1989 and 2003, but also for B.C. MLA Rosemary Brown's path-breaking leadership run in 1975.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the NDP is unusual for the sustained numerical presence of women MPs, a result, in part, of internal rules that mandate the recruitment of female candidates in winnable seats. After the 2006 federal election, for instance, women constituted more than 40 per cent of NDP MPs, compared with 11 per cent of the Conservative caucus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with these strides, however, we can't assume that gender barriers have disappeared in the NDP. Ms. Nash, Ms. Ashton and their supporters need to pay close attention to two problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the federal party's weak standing after 1989 remains a powerful drag on women's upward mobility. Female candidates in 2012 need to present a compelling account of the foundational work carried out by party leaders, including Ed Broadbent, Ms. McLaughlin and Ms. McDonough, in the years before Jack Layton's 2003 election to the top post. In particular, female candidates need to acknowledge the contributions of each predecessor in a way that's both respectful and wide-eyed, in the sense that it addresses the anxiety party members feel about past electoral setbacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, Ms. Nash and Ms. Ashton must compete based on substance rather than style or tone. To date, both have focused their campaigns on matters of process rather than public policy: Ms. Nash stresses her skills as a bridge-builder who can bring together disparate elements of the party as well as the country, while Ms. Ashton says she'll practise a “new politics” – echoing a phrase that sounded considerably fresher when Kim Campbell used it in the 1993 federal Progressive Conservative leadership race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The presence of high-profile female politicians has become so routine that these clichés risk undermining the candidates who use them. It's true that many female politicians, such as Alberta Premier Alison Redford, practise politics differently than their predecessors. Yet, they succeed not by asserting the existence of that distinctive style, but by demonstrating its impact on policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Nash and Ms. Ashton can draw on extensive organizational research that documents the greater willingness of female managers to transcend traditional hierarchies, and thus develop strong teams that reach decisions based on consensus rather than conflict. Framing their own backgrounds in light of this literature has the advantage of not just drawing attention to the interpersonal qualities of other candidates, but also shining a spotlight on how relevant each candidate's skill set is to present challenges facing the party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the realm of politics, though, leadership choices largely come down to judging which candidate offers the best chance of electoral success. For Ms. Nash and Ms. Ashton, saying they'll do politics differently is insufficient to win that race.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Peplinski knew something special was happening here in the early moments following the Finland-Slovakia quarter-final game last Monday afternoon.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the scoreboard had stopped – Finland 8, Slovakia 5 – the real clock was moving on, with the next match between Russia and Czech Republic coming up fast at the Scotiabank Saddledome. And the rink had more crumpled popcorn bags and empty beer glasses than the cleaning staff could handle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peplinski was with his own four children – Erin, 24, Matt, 23, Anny, 19, Quinn, 16, and their friend Curt Wettstein, 25 – and he asked them: “Would you mind helping?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, they said, and began picking up. Soon there were dozens of volunteers helping out the cleaners – including several employees of the Calgary Flames organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Here were these senior executives putting on rubber gloves and lining up for garbage bags to pitch in,” Peplinski says. “You want to tell me that's not Canada?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peplinski, the 51-year-old former captain of the NHL's Flames, is the face of the Edmonton-Calgary bid for the 2012 world junior hockey championship. Though he represented Canada in the 1988 Olympics, he never did play in the world juniors. “I didn't get picked.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peplinski was a tough-as-nails NHLer, believed by many to be the inventor of the face wash and once a fearsome fighter, though today he believes fighting has no place in the game. He was also once so despised by the Flames' archrival Edmonton Oilers that he believed it impossible for him to be involved in any enterprise that would involve the more northern of the two Alberta cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following his retirement during the 1989-90 season, he became a broadcaster and then a businessman, opening several vehicle-leasing dealerships, including one in Edmonton that he initially believed was a bad call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They tried to kill me for 10 years,” he says of his battles with the Oilers, “and I tried to return the favour.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ken King of the Flames asked Peplinski to come on board as a vice-president of business development and they decided to go after the 2009 world junior tournament, which ended up being awarded to Ottawa. Instead of giving up, they went to Ottawa to learn how to put on such an event – “[Ottawa Senators president] Cyril Leeder was unbelievably helpful” – and won the 2012 tournament.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is already presumed that this will be the most successful world juniors in history, with revenues projected into the $80-million range. Peplinski says there were no hard promises made. “We said, ‘Look, we do stuff on a handshake out here. We will generate so much out here that no one will touch the financial returns we will guarantee.'” If the price of oil stayed up, he assured the International Ice Hockey Federation and Hockey Canada, “We'll shoot the lights out.” And it appears they will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peplinski says that, for him, the tournament is not about money generated or the size of the 50/50 draw or even which team wins, but “the intangibles” – lessons taken from watching youngsters play for the love of game and country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I believe in what you saw in the Sweden-Russia game early on,” he says. “You get up when you fall down. You work out your problems. You stress the importance of team. You learn how to win – but also how to lose.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What the junior tournament demonstrates, he says, is “the pureness of the sport.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But also the goodness of heart – especially when concerning the Spirit of the West shown by the multitude of volunteers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have geophysicists, doctors, lawyers, taxi drivers, home keepers, clerks, students, you name it,” Peplinski says. “Every one of them giving their time for this event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you said we're going to need the Calgary Tower down by 6 a.m. tomorrow, they'd find a way to get it done.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon enough, Filip Forsberg will be a household name in hockey circles, if all goes according to plan. Forsberg is here as part of Sweden's team in the world junior hockey championship, and will be playing for the gold medal Thursday against either Canada or Russia.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the No. 1-ranked European prospect for the 2012 NHL entry draft, there is extra cachet attached to his presence on a very good – and occasionally very lucky – Swedish team, which tied its game against Finland late and then won in a shootout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sweden has all kinds of talent here – from Max Friberg, who seems to score all the big goals, to Sebastien Collberg, the other under-ager on the team, who seems to come through in all the shootouts. But Forsberg is a special talent, a player that coach Roger Ronnberg says is mature beyond his years. If he is, and if he is selected in the top five of the 2012 NHL entry draft, it usually means a quick transition to the NHL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than ever, youth is in vogue in these days in professional hockey and Forsberg is just the latest in a long line of newish Swedish prospects – think Gabriel Landeskog, think Erik Karlsson, think Adam Larsson – making an early mark in the professional ranks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But no, to answer the question that immediately pops into your head, Forsberg is not related to that Forsberg, Peter, the future Hall of Famer who won two Stanley Cups with the Colorado Avalanche, a scoring title and with apologies to Mats Sundin and Markus Naslund, was the dominant Swede of his generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Forsberg hailed from Modo, Filip is from Leksand. Peter Forsberg was a dynamic all-round player, with an unexpected physical edge to his game. The scouts compare Filip more to fellow Swede Daniel Alfredsson, who in his prime was a top-flight goal-scorer, and recently made it 400 for his NHL career.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sweden's hockey program has undergone a renaissance of sorts these past half-dozen years. During the time the Sedins were coming up, it was them, and nobody else. There was concern that soccer, tennis and other sports were funnelling off the best athletes and that hockey was a lot of people's second choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the same way that Russia keeps pumping out players, even if many of them are staying home to play in the Continental Hockey League, Sweden is becoming a hotbed again – and Swedish players almost always choose the NHL option, making them a far more attractive commodity for teams looking for immediate help. The Sedins are at the top of the scoring charts again, Henrik Lundqvist stars in goal for the New York Rangers and many will argue that Nicklas Lidstrom is one of the greatest defenceman in hockey history. And if one can make a generalization, they are – as a group – among the most low-maintenance players, another quality in high demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ronnberg describes Forsberg as a player with “a unique attitude and character. He can look at himself from the outside, if that is the right way to say it in English. The way he approaches the game is fantastic. He loves to play. It doesn't matter if we are here in the practice rink or if we're playing Canada in the Rexall Centre, he's the same kid. He's just competing – chasing the puck.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since arriving for the world junior tournament, Forsberg has deflected many questions about his famous surname, noting that though they are not related, Peter The Great was his favourite player growing up, and the most influential on his career. Ronnberg sees that, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The most important part of Peter's game is the way he was competing,” Ronnberg said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He was always competing – doing everything it takes to win a hockey game. And Filip is the same, the same character. Then they have differences in the way they play. But it's a good comparison.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During Peter Forsberg's Colorado Avalanche heyday, Filip Forsberg didn't get much of a chance to watch him play. The games were on too late, most nights. “But national teams, those games I have seen, and I have seen his tributes many times on the <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, too,” Forsberg said.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the broadcast world's best efforts to create a hockey rivalry between Canada and the United States, Canadians know this morning, if they didn't already, that the rival that matters most in hockey is Russia – just as it was 40 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday night, the two hockey powers met in the semi-finals of the World Junior Hockey Championship and the Russians put a crushing end to any hopes Canada had of a gold medal with a hard-fought 6-5 victory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a game that at times had all the high drama of the legendary 1972 Summit Series between Canada and the Soviet Union, the teenaged Russians bested the Canadian teenagers in a game that held every emotion imaginable in sport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, however, it was pure despair for the Canadians, unable to complete a valiant third-period comeback that simply ran out of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The victorious Russians move on to play Sweden Thursday, when they will defend the gold medal they won last year in Buffalo, while the Canadians will meet Finland, a team they defeated 8-1 in the preliminary round, for the bronze – an award many Canadians take to be the ultimate insult in their national game. For 10 years straight, Canada had played in the gold-medal match, at one point winning five championships in a row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russians won on precisely the strategy the Canadians had used successfully in the preliminary round played in Edmonton – a fast start – when speedy Yevgeni Kuznetsov scored off a pass from highly touted 2012 draft pick Nail Yakupov and then went ahead 2-0 when Nikita Nesterov blasted a shot from the point on a Russian power play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's important for us to get off to a good start,” Team Canada head coach Don Hay had said earlier in the day. They did not, and they paid heavily for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadians fought back early in the second period when Brett Connolly scored on a delayed penalty, but very quickly Mr. Kuznetsov put Russia ahead again by two – this time on a wrist shot that Canadian goaltender Scott Wedgewood fanned on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon it was 4-1, with. Kuznetsov, the tournament's leading scorer, picking up his third of the game. Wedgewood was replaced by Mark Visentin before the game was half over. The Russians scored on their second shot on Visentin, by forward Alexander Khokhlachev.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russians made it 6-1 in the third period, and seemingly out of reach, when Nikita Kucherov finished off a nifty passing play that left Visentin at his mercy. The Canadians came back, however, beginning with a second goal when Dougie Hamilton tipped a pass in behind Russian goaltender Andrei Vasilevski.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Team Canada forward Freddie Hamilton had called for his team to play “a good Canadian game” – hard-hitting, smart, quick and effective – and they did exactly that, once the third period got under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This re-match had been highly anticipated ever since the Russians had stormed back in the third period a year ago in Buffalo to wipe out a 3-0 Canadian lead in the gold-medal match and win 5-3. That game is considered the greatest Canadian “meltdown” – a more palatable word than “choke” – in the long history of world junior play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadians, far more feisty in the third period than earlier in the game, very nearly duplicated the Russian feat when they scored two quick goals midway through the third to make it 6-3. First Dougie Hamilton, Freddie Hamilton's brother, scored on a tip in, then team captain Jaden Schwartz managed to bank a shot off a Russian defender into the net.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then it got wild, with first Brendan Gallagher tipping in a shot, then Brandon Gormley scoring to put the Canadians within on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seemed redemption for Buffalo 2011 was at hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's not about redemption,” Hay had said earlier in the day, but he knew, as all did, that this semi-final match was as much about revenge as it was about advancing to the gold medal game. The story was about the two essentials of great hockey, no matter which country is playing: skill and speed. The Russians simply had more of each than the Canadians through two periods, the Canadians more than the Russians in the third. All three goaltenders surely now understand what Hall-of-Famer Gump Worsley meant when he said “The only worse job is a javelin catcher at a track-and-field meet.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary poet Richard Harrison has called often called hockey “the national id” and the importance of this game was as evident in the boos during the first two periods as it was in the wild cheers of the third.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Redemption is merely on hold for another year.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When speaking to an expert like a cheesemonger, we may feel we lack proper terminology to convey what we want. Remember that even a simple request for something “bold” or “mild” narrows the playing field. The word “buttery” will open a world of creamy options. You say “salty,” they offer Parmigiano-Reggiano or feta, you say “stinky” and they pull out époisses or taleggio. Think practically: Will you be grating, melting, slicing or entertaining? If you have a specific mission just describe the goal, as in “I need to kick grilled-cheese butt” or “It's English and orange but not cheddar.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remember that anyone with a passion loves to talk about it, and good cheesemongers will always have a list of peak cheeses on the tips of their tongues. A simple “what's ripe today?” might be all you have to say to get five minutes of instant cheese education and a lifelong addiction to reblochon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Otherwise, your only job is to ask for a taste. You've done it a million times when buying an ice cream cone, so don't get shy when buying cheese. Even your favourite cheddar can taste different from one wheel to the next, and soft cheeses will vary in ripeness from week to week (or day to day). Product turnover and care can vary significantly from shop to shop, so don't assume your favourite cheese tastes the same everywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you do most of your shopping in a grocery store, you'll probably be choosing from a shelf of plastic-wrapped cheese pieces, not knowing how long ago they were packaged. The good news is that you can gain a fair amount of information by doing a simple visual assessment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First of all, read the label. It seems obvious but sometimes we just look at the name and the price. The label and ingredient list can tell you the producer, country of origin, whether the milk is organic, raw or pasteurized, and whether it came from a cow, sheep or goat. At the very least, look for “milk” as the first ingredient, as opposed to modified milk ingredients (MMI). You can also determine the type of rennet used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Firm and hard cheeses will stand up best to being packaged in advance. If there is a rind, it might be rustic and mottled, but should not be warped or cracked. The interior of the cheese should be an even tone and texture. Being slightly darker at the rind is okay but overall discoloration is a sign of poor quality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For soft cheeses with bloomy rinds (brie style) or washed rinds (like Oka), the exterior should be intact and bright with no cracks or dryness. The exterior of a washed rind might be slightly moist or damp, but should not be slimy. The paste of a cheese should never be coming away from the rind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, with softer cheeses, look for a “best before” date close to when you want to eat it (be it today or next week). You want it ripe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once home, release the cheese from the plastic and wrap in wax paper or parchment, allowing the rind to breathe and keep longer. If the cheese has a slight ammonia smell, let it sit open before eating. If the smell is strong and does not go away (even on a blue cheese), return it as it has spoiled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can't beat the rewards of building a relationship with a cheesemonger, but last week I got a perfectly ripe, oozing piece of Champfleury at <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span>. The goal is good quality cheese, wherever you get it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be nice to report that Bomb Girls (Global, 8 p.m.) is terrific television. Can't be done. It's arch, unsubtle and numbingly obvious.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The six-part miniseries arrives on a giant wave of publicity. The sort of gee-whiz coverage that often accompanies a big-budget Canadian production, a giddiness that causes people to forget to ask, “But is it any good?” What happens is, the premise is promoted, the lead actors are promoted and everybody is just peachy-keen to talk it up. The quality of the content doesn't seem to matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The very, very soap-opera series is about the lives of Canadian women who worked in munitions factories during the Second World War. It plays heavily on the idea that these women went quickly from being stay-at-home wives and moms to working women doing dangerous work. The sexism they faced. The danger in their daily toil. The romance and the heartbreak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meg Tilly plays Lorna, the factory's tough-minded shift boss overseeing a motley crew of women who deal with countless personal issues while working and worrying about the men in their lives who are at war overseas. Tilly is a commanding presence and a small number of the characters are deftly drawn, but Bomb Girls is horribly overblown, feels like it was written for simpletons, and is clumsily directed. The idea is first-rate but the production has all the emotional heft and subtlety of some horrible 1950s musical about perky gals helping out with the war effort and falling for unsuitable men.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many ways Bomb Girls is just an unsophisticated victimization fantasy – women have to give up so much in order to work, men are awful and, sometimes, other women can be really mean and spiteful. All shocking news to viewers, no doubt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dialogue has a unnervingly forced sound, as if everyone was trying way too hard to sound like characters in a 1940s movie. “Get your girls in order and get your big, flapping face outta here!” Lorna is told by a guy whose instructions seem to be that he must sound like Jimmy Cagney at all times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A serious problem is the spouting of exposition at every opportunity, as if the viewer needed to be reminded during every scene that the production is set in the 1940s. At one point a female character says of the solders going to war: “Let's face it, as soon as those hunks of heartbreak set eyes on the first khaki-wacky English lass, they forget we exist.” Jiminy. “Hunks of heartbreak” and “Khaki-wacky English lass.” It is a tribute to the actor that such stuff can be spoken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With period drama, the best strategy is to allow the setting to emerge organically from the characters and situations. Here the 1940s setting seems entirely constructed from comic-book versions of the period. Nothing gels. The writing, acting and direction wobble this way and that, never finding a compelling rhythm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is little to recommend in Bomb Girls, but that little should be noted. The production does look gorgeous. The production design is exceptional, the costumes are striking and the overall visual impact is startling. Jodi Balfour is very good as Gladys, the rich girl defying her family by taking a job in the munitions factory. And Anastasia Phillips is truly excellent as Vera, a strong woman who becomes a victim, but not of the snarling men.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was tremendous potential with Bomb Girls. The idea is fine and the execution of the look is extraordinary. But the strained mimicking of melodrama from the 1940s and 1950s sinks it. Pity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Airing Tonight</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nova: Deadliest Volcanoes (PBS, 8 p.m.) is all about “sleeping giant” volcanoes and when they might explode. Scientists who study the issue are interviewed. There is much speculation about the horror that might ensue when they do erupt. It's something to worry about if you're in the vicinity of Japan's Mount Fuji, the volcano called “The Sleeping Giant” under Naples or the Yellowstone “supervolcano” in the United States. If you want to indulge in more awe at nature tonight there is also Mystery of the Super Flood (CBC NN, 10 p.m.) which solves “one of the Earth's strangest geological riddles” – it explains how a colossal flood created bizarre landscapes near Seattle and how the theory of a flood was the subject of derision until it was proven correct by events in Iceland. It is unclear whether the giant flood is expected to happen again.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Editor-in-chief and publisher of Global Brief magazine</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First things first: I'm largely agnostic on the intrinsic merits of the new initiative by the Conservative government to establish an Office of Religious Freedom within the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. I say this because excessive argument about what's effectively a microstructure in a sizable federal department perpetuates a long-standing weakness in Canada's foreign policy debates: an intellectual obsession with “ends” (in this case, protecting religious minorities around the world) at the expense of building the strategic “means” to achieve any “ends” of consequence.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Successive governments in Ottawa have all too easily subscribed to the conventional wisdom that if we as a country could only determine what our interests were, what our principles or values were, and indeed what our core international purpose was, then we could, by logic, proceed to advance a coherent and effective foreign policy agenda. All of these, of course, are concerns solely about the “ends” of our foreign policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naturally, as Canada is a vast and diverse land, and as different prime ministers have different conceptions of what the country ought to do in the world, the country almost never reaches a point of general “consensus” about which “ends” are worth pursuing. And so the debate continues ad nauseam, with perhaps only isolationists totally sated by the conceptual impasse that has led us to underperform as a country on the global stage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The core of the foreign policy and larger international affairs debate in Canada should not be about the ends we may wish to pursue as a collective, but rather about the means necessary to advance the ends legitimately chosen by any elected government. The desired ends will clearly change according to the times and government, but the means to success for Canada are stable and undifferentiated, and they need to be built up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without this reversal of strategic logic (means before ends, rather than ends dictating means), we Canadians are left talking to ourselves about problems in the world we're interested in but typically incapable of solving – for lack of the requisite means to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One is reminded of the 2007 speech by Prime Minister Stephen Harper about Canada's intending to become a leader in the Americas (a perfectly legitimate “end” goal for a wealthy, reputable country such as Canada). Some years from now, historians in Latin America may wonder just how Canada planned to achieve its stated end of regional leadership. Answer: With no Spanish speakers! Or Portuguese speakers, for that matter. (By the time Australia had determined it wished to be a player in Asia, future prime minister Kevin Rudd – then chief of staff to the premier of Queensland – had already convinced the federal and state governments that the country needed a national Asian languages strategy.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what's the nature of the “means” debate that Canada needs to have to be a major (and credible) global player this century? Two interrelated “means” levers need to be addressed: national culture and national capabilities. A country that's serious about advancing ambitious ends in the world – defending minority religions or, say, brokering peace and transforming impoverished countries, or even fighting a just war – requires a public culture that can properly assess happenings beyond North America, and can support sustained engagement by Canada beyond our borders. More concretely, it needs the practical capabilities to advance these ends: talent (in key positions), assets (intelligence, military, diplomatic), money and, to be sure, differentiated relationships with players in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be a leader not only in the Americas but also in the world, Canada needs more foreign affairs culture, and certainly more capabilities. We might start by creating that army of Spanish and Portuguese speakers that the federal government surely requires to advance its stated ends. Let's add some Mandarin and Arabic speakers for good measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of this is possible without a brave political leadership that applies pressure over time to build the culture and capabilities today that will allow us to score major foreign policy achievements in the long term. But we can be confident that transformation of the Canadian means to regularly realize great projects in the world will make small potatoes of the current argument over the Office of Religious Freedom.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governments in North America and Europe will either confront their swollen debts now or waste the year talking while doing nothing. Either way, the year will be about facing or avoiding debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doing nothing is what the United States will try in this presidential election year. Every politician will talk about the need to reduce the country's national debt, but the political system will be unable to act. So the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio that stood at 35 per cent when George W. Bush took office and 60 per cent when he left will hit 86 per cent next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Europe, Greece, Ireland and Iceland have smashed against the debt wall, while other countries are struggling to avoid it. Italy, Portugal, Spain and France have already announced tax increases and/or spending reductions. In Britain, things are as bad, fiscally speaking, as in the United States. The British deficit for 2012 will be about 9 per cent of GDP, net debt around 70 per cent, with slow growth and high unemployment forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which brings us to Canada. The 2008 recession and its aftermath laid debt across the land. Surpluses turned into deficits for governments, and personal indebtedness soared. Some governments, such as Quebec's, have been bravely raising taxes to cope with deficits; most have done nothing, hoping for a resumption of strong economic growth to lift their revenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a decade before the 2008 recession, Canada lived off the avails of the Chrétien-Martin debt- and deficit-reduction policies of the mid-1990s. What followed from those policies was a decade of low interest rates, declining debt payments, fiscal surpluses, lower taxes, low unemployment and strong growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the economy grew and the federal government shrank, governments' (federal and provincial) share of the total economy fell from 49.7 per cent in 1994 to 39.3 per cent when the Liberals gave way to the Harper Conservatives. During the same period, federal debt as a share of GDP dropped from 70 per cent to 30 per cent; the share of GDP taken by taxes fell from 43 per cent to 41 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Harper Conservatives cut taxes – tax as a share of GDP has now fallen to 38 per cent – but let spending rip. Conservative spending increased at 5 per cent to 6 per cent a year before the recession, then exploded during it and thereafter. The result was predictable: a structural deficit (meaning a deficit even with strong GDP growth), an upsurge in borrowing and total government outlays higher than when the Conservatives were elected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way out of this pickle would be to raise taxes, since taxes as a share of GDP have fallen – from a high of 45 per cent in 1998 to 38 per cent today. But the Harper Conservatives are against any tax increases. Their only options for eventually producing a balanced budget are to (a) wait for stronger economic growth to produce more revenue, or (b) cut government spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the Harper Conservatives have never cut spending before, this will be a test for them. But they have a majority government, and it's their first year in a fresh mandate. If ever they're to cut, now is the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How large the cuts will be won't be known until the budget. The government has ruled out cuts to provincial transfers and to individuals. That leaves only federal programs to be sliced by 5 per cent to 10 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A cynic would say this is what hard-core conservatives always want. Cut taxes, run up deficits, then use these as justification for reducing government. A less cynical interpretation is that conservatives are just as politically scared as centrists and leftists of the public reaction to cuts, so they seldom make any. Moreover, some conservatives still cling to the discredited theory that tax cuts eventually pay for themselves with higher revenue. When that theory collapses, only deficits remain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The provinces also will be grappling with debt, especially in Ontario, where ratings agencies are already circling. The years of studied avoidance by politicians are over: Ontario's fiscal situation is a mess. The longer it takes to clean up the mess, the worse it will get.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Greek government is flirting with danger, perhaps only as a negotiating tactic, but, if so, its bluff could be called. First, on Tuesday, its spokesman, Pantelis Kapsis, raised the possibility that Greece would leave the euro, if the negotiations on the next instalment of rescue measures – worth about €130-billion – do not make good progress. Then on Wednesday, Lucas Papademos, the Prime Minister, raised the prospect of “disorderly default” if those negotiations – with the so-called troika of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund – do not succeed before early March.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These statements are not in themselves outrageous, but the acknowledgment of these risks from such sources is provocative. Mr. Papademos, almost universally classified as a technocrat as opposed to a politician, took office when the troika – and the international policy community as a whole – became fed up with the Greek political class. But the new government of experts is adopting its own rhetorical poses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To whom are these messages addressed – to the troika and the bondholders, or to the Greek labour unions and the Greek people? Probably, to all of these. And that is as it should be. Some reports suggest that the Papademos government is on its way to obtaining significant concessions from both the international bondholders and the central body of Greek private-sector unions. The technocratic Prime Minister may be a politician, after all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro and the euro zone can live on, with or without the small Greek economy. And one way or another, the Greeks will have to cope with lower price and wage levels for several years. What is to be avoided is disorderly default, panic, runs on banks, and an inability to conduct the most ordinary commercial transactions.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mitt Romney does indeed have the clearest path of any other candidate to the Republican party nomination – as some commentators have observed – how would he fare against President Barack Obama in a national contest?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some polls that give Mr. Obama a significant edge over Mr. Romney. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released in mid-December shows that the President would defeat the former Massachusetts governor in a nation-wide vote 48 per cent to 40 per cent.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet another poll shows Mr. Romney favoured by 45 per cent of eligible voters against 39 per cent who favour Mr. Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most polls show Mr. Obama's advantage is actually very slight and, taking into consideration the margin of error in polling, the two politicians are pretty even. For example, the Real Clear Politics poll – which is an average of nine polls in December on the question of Mr. Obama versus Mr. Romney – has the President ahead by a mere 1.6 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Romney's win in Iowa will probably produce a favourable bump in any new polling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iowa Republicans who voted for Mr. Romney cited his electability on a national stage against Mr. Obama as a key motivation for voting for him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there's good reason for that: Polling shows Mr. Obama would do better in a national contest against any of the remaining Republican field.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As ever, swing states will be key in the 2012 presidential election. And in states such as Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin, a mid-December poll had Mr. Romney edging Mr. Obama 48 per cent to 43 per cent – even if the national picture is still a Romney-Obama tie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interestingly, the same poll gave Newt Gingrich an edge over Mr. Obama in those swing states. Then again, mid-December was so long ago and Mr. Gingrich's numbers have dropped since then, resulting in a fourth-place finish in Iowa.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collectively, we have nearly 10 decades of experience in the area of corrections and conditional release. There are many issues we have disagreed over, but we are united in our concerns with the direction of the Harper government's “tough on crime” agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a country that prides itself on fairness, compassion and the pursuit of equality, why do we accept the idea that community safety will be enhanced through increased incarceration?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At both the federal and provincial levels, Canadian jails are overcrowded. It is becoming common to see double- and triple-bunking of inmates in cells designed for one. This overcrowding limits access to already scarce rehabilitative programming and increases the incidence of institutional violence. The fastest-growing portions of the inmate population continue to be those most marginalized within our society: the mentally ill, women and aboriginals. Decades of reports have detailed our correctional systems' failure to reasonably address the needs of these offenders and limit their numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill C-10, the Safe Streets and Communities Act, which is before the Senate, will significantly increase the prison population. The Canadian Bar Association, summarizing its testimony before the House of Commons standing committee on justice and human rights, stated that the bill “will require new prisons; mandate incarceration for minor, non-violent offences; justify poor treatment of inmates and make their reintegration into society more difficult.” These results are inconsistent with our collective concepts of fairness, compassion and equality. In addition, no evidence is provided to support the bill's objectives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, the message from other jurisdictions that have pursued increased incarceration as a solution to safer communities is clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an editorial on Dec. 6, 2010, The New York Times stated: “There is almost unanimous condemnation of California-style mass incarceration, which has led to no reduction in serious crime and has turned many inmates into habitual criminals. America's prison system is now studied largely because of its failure – the result of an expensive approach to criminal justice shaped by fear-driven ideology.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same month, The Guardian led with a report on British Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke's efforts to restore judicial discretion in sentencing. Aiming to reverse nearly 20 years of punitive criminal justice culture, the report said, Mr. Clarke “signalled that he would sweep away aspects of the statutory sentencing framework in England and Wales that ‘unhelpfully fetters' the ability of judges to make the sentence fit the crime.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our collective experience and decades of research tell us that increased rates of incarceration neither decrease crime nor act as a deterrent to it. Safer communities and effective crime prevention are achieved through the development of integrated systems with both the flexibility and resources required to respond to individuals in a timely fashion. As a society, we must be prepared to actively support and finance early intervention strategies for youth; a judicial process with options to ensure that incarceration is a last resort; a community mental-health system that keeps the ill out of jail; a prison service that addresses individual offenders' problems rather than acting as a human warehouse; and conditional-release programming that supports timely, safe community reintegration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our focus and our resources should be directed toward keeping people out of jail, not in it. The financial cost of implementing effective, integrated systems pales in comparison to the billions it costs to build and operate new prisons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Criminal justice legislation that increases prison populations while draining resources from community programs in mental health, education, child poverty and social services makes absolutely no sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fiscal and human costs of the path we are on, in pursuit of safer communities, are far too high and will not be easily reversed. Sober second thought is desperately needed. We call on the Senate to ensure that our justice policies promote a fair and effective corrections and conditional-release system that will actually make Canada safer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meet the new boss: Jiang Jemin, the 55-year-old chairman of China National Petroleum Corp. He's about to become an Alberta employer.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, <span class="companylink">Athabasca Oil Sands Corp</span>. triggered an option on a 2009 deal with CNPC subsidiary <span class="companylink">PetroChina</span>, so the Chinese oil giant is not just a shareholder but also the owner and operator of the MacKay River oil sands project, to open in 2014. In December, another Chinese firm, Sinopec, closed a $2.2-billion deal for <span class="companylink">Daylight Energy Ltd</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is new and will have a lasting impact. Chinese firms aren't just buying stakes, they're buying whole operations. It's a new phase of China's step-by-step Canada strategy. It will change not just the oil patch but Canada's foreign policy. And a game of international energy politics is afoot in Canada's West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These deals are different because Canadians will see how Chinese firms operate, not just invest. They're state-controlled companies, with executives such as Mr. Jiang who have moved among the Communist Party, government and big oil. Some fears, though not all, can now be tested; such as suggestions they will flout environmental or labour standards. They're about to be Canadian employers, and may eventually be important ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also a step in a strategy that's not complete. The Chinese have tested the waters in Canada for six years, first with small deals that didn't require government approval, then bigger deals that did, but only for part-ownership. Now it's full ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after $2-billion deals, a $10-billion deal for a Canadian energy giant is surely next, though perhaps not for a few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The question is whether the political appetite would be there,” said Goldy Hyder, general manager of <span class="companylink">Hill &amp; Knowlton</span> in Ottawa, and a lobbyist for Canadian and Chinese clients on big energy deals. “And whether companies have done the right thing to get the social licence.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, Canadians will have to be convinced that Chinese state companies should be allowed to own big chunks of their natural resources, and not fear Beijing's influence in Canada, or rapacious exploitation of the resource to fuel Chinese industry, or bad corporate behaviour. The public image of China and Chinese companies will matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does China want? There's no pipeline to the West Coast, so Alberta bitumen can't be shipped to China, yet. In part, Chinese companies are making a financial investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But China is also obsessed with energy security. It sees meeting the rapidly rising energy demands of its industry as key to sustaining its economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China wants technology to help extract their own hard-to-reach resources, especially natural gas. But it also wants diverse imports as protection against disruptions in supply from conflict or politics. It's building pipelines, in part to ensure that less of its supply comes through the narrow Strait of Malacca, which, in theory, could be choked off by conflict or even piracy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And resource investments around the world indicate China doesn't want to rely on buying products on the markets. It wants to own. The Chinese companies expect there will eventually be pipelines to the West Coast that will allow shipments across the Pacific.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's where the oil sands is wedged between superpowers. The United States also worries about energy security. It viewed the oil sands as captive supply, because the direction of the pipelines makes it the only export destination now. A West Coast pipeline would make that uncertain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's still years away: hearings on the proposed Northern Gateway oil pipeline to the B.C. Coast start next week, but will take at least two years. But Stephen Harper has already rattled the sword.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After U.S. President Barack Obama delayed a decision on the Keystone XL pipeline extension to the U.S. Gulf Coast, Mr. Harper revealed in a year-end interview with CTV that he had a “tough luck” response for Americans who assured him it would eventually be approved, and Canada could continue to sell all of its oil there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I said, ‘Yeah we'd love to,' but I think the problem is now that we're on a different track,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harper has some cards with China, too. He has sent signals that state-owned Chinese business can be owners in Canada, which might give him some points as he seeks things like an investment protection agreement from Beijing. And the biggest deals are still in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that happens, Chinese firms that are major Canadian employers, backed by an owner that is the government of a major trading partner, will only increase the pressure for a West Coast pipeline. And energy sales will speed the shift of Canadian priorities across the Pacific.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's just say there's some unhappiness out there. Stock market ups and downs over the past four years have left some seniors bewildered and angry about what's happened to their investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We saved,” one retiree told me in an e-mail response to a recent column that said inadequate retirement savings are going to spur demand for reverse mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The market made sure it was not enough.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not just the markets, this reader said. “No, indeed, where the blame should be firmly planted [is] at financial professionals and their ignorance of the market trend.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mad at the markets, and mad at the investment industry. How many aging baby boomers might that describe?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's how a 60-year-old reader from Vancouver describes what she's found to be wrong with the financial industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think there's an incredible absence of good, honest advice,” she said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I see so many people – educated people, professional-class people – who have resources and they're spinning their wheels going from one adviser to the next.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hefty fees Canadians pay to own mutual funds have been criticized lately on the basis that they undermine the returns people will increasingly depend on to fund their retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to focus on fees is to miss a bigger picture that encompasses both investing products and investing advice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, built-in fees for advisers are one of the biggest reasons why mutual funds cost what they do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the fall, I was asked to appear at annual educational forums staged by organizations that oversee two highly reputable financial planning designations, the Certified Financial Planner and the Registered Financial Planner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both events were well attended by advisers who gave every indication of being committed, well-informed and conscientious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's a disconnect in some cases between the industry these people work in and the massive demographic wave of baby boomers who (a) have all the money and (b) are coming to a point in their lives where they have never been more in need of financial advice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard to say if the financial industry even knows what's happening at the customer level. The industry loves to commission polls and surveys that inevitably ratify its world view. Advice is important. Canadians value advice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I ran a little poll of my own on my <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> personal finance page (facebook.com/robcarrickfinance) on Dec. 8 in which I asked people to complete the sentence: “I think mutual funds are: ______.” Many of the responses almost melted my computer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot of the anger out there has to be linked to the market ups and downs we've been subjected to since summer, 2007. But it's starting to appear as if there's more to this than a sense of frustration with undependable stocks and low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trust in the entire investment industry has been worn down. A lot of what was said and sold to investors hasn't worked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling markets upset investors, while rising markets pacify them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unhappiness might blow over if investors find that the products they were sold and the advice they received was, after all, on the money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experience of that 60-year-old Vancouver reader suggests this is no sure thing, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She's on her fifth adviser, which tells us she may be what they call a difficult client. Still, her criticisms are worth hearing. Two of her advisers distinguished themselves with a stock picker's approach that included recommendations to buy Ballard Power (down 83 per cent over the past five years) and Citibank (down 95 per cent over the same period).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another worked at a financial planning firm that charged stiff fees for what amounted to management of a portfolio of guaranteed investment certificates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another suggested replacing a perfectly good low-cost mutual fund with a high-cost wrap product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I didn't do my due diligence until I was getting near the retirement cliff,” this reader admits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was busy taking care of my life and raising my children, putting money aside and listening [as stocks fell] to people saying: ‘Oh well, that's the market, it will take time.' ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her diagnosis of what's wrong with the client-adviser relationship: “People aren't pushy enough asking questions.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Get ready, investment industry. Exam time is coming as baby boomers retire and start to look at what decades of saving and investing got them.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I know a guy who used to run a bank, back in the olden days. Nobody had heard of stock options then. He lived in a nice house, but not a mansion. He did not make 250 times more money than the average Canadian, as some top bankers do today. Sometimes, he sounds rueful that he missed out on the bonanza years, when executive pay zoomed into the stratosphere. Mostly, though, he thinks the world has gone a little nuts.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So does Roger Martin, dean of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto. He says the way we pay executives today is ridiculous and perverse. And he thinks the worm may be about to turn. “Greed,” he says, “is not quite as good as it was before.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new report by the left-leaning Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives is helping to stir the pay pot. It found that the country's top 100 CEOs (that is, the 100 highest paid CEOs of companies listed in the TSX index) make, on average, $8.4-million, which is 189 times more than the average wage. Three-quarters of their income typically comes from stock options, which are tied to the company's stock-market performance. In 2010, average Canadian salaries went up 1 per cent. Theirs went up 27 per cent. Even in bad times, executive compensation just keeps going up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm no class warrior. If Frank Stronach can bully Magna's board into paying him $62-million, well, good for him. After all, he started the company. But what about the hired guns, which is what most CEOs are? Although their pay is supposedly related to performance, it's grown faster than a patch of kudzu vine in Georgia. In just 20 years between 1980 and 2000, says Mr. Martin, CEO pay per dollar of net income produced went up by a factor of eight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How did things get so out of whack? The answer you usually get is that the world is far more complex than ever before, companies are bigger and more global, outstanding talent is in short supply, blah, blah, blah. All true. But Mr. Martin believes there are more compelling reasons. In the 1970s, a series of economic shocks led people to focus on the types of incentives that might produce prosperity. That's when the idea of tying pay to performance was born.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the talent premium was soaring in every field, from sports to music. It seemed logical that top corporate leaders also deserved a piece of the upside. And then the cult of the CEO began to take off. Suddenly, bankers weren't boring, faceless drones any more. They were on the cover of Fortune. Soon, some of them were getting paid like rock stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble is that corporations picked the wrong incentive. Instead of tying compensation to performance in the real world, they tied it to the stock price. This was one of the lousier ideas in the history of capitalism. It meant that the way to win was not to sell more stuff or make more money, but to increase the stock price. Much mischief has ensued, which you can read all about in Mr. Martin's excellent book, Fixing the Game. He thinks stock options should be abolished, period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stock options were not the only instance of perverse results. In the mid-1990s, public companies had to start disclosing the salaries of top management. It was thought that making this information public would help keep executive compensation in check. In fact, it triggered an ever-upward spiral. “It was like Lake Wobegon. Everybody said, ‘We don't want our CEO to be below average.' ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Martin's crusade to pull the plug on stock options hasn't caught on just yet. But he's hopeful that the zeitgeist is changing again. Conspicuous consumption is out. Modesty, restraint and social responsibility are in. Today's business hero isn't the guy who builds a 60,000-square-foot mega-mansion. It's Steve Jobs, who lived in a relatively ordinary house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think we've reached a tipping point,” Mr. Martin says. “I think enough people have begun to ask, ‘How is it that executives get to make lots of money even if the company doesn't do well?' ” That's what my friend who used to run the bank wonders, too. Smart CEOs should be wondering the same thing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than ever, there is a weird disconnect between mainstream coverage of television and the emotional connection that viewers have with certain TV series.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is so much TV, so many channels and shows and so little time for many viewers to indulge. There is massive coverage of meaningless shows, much of it fuelled by marketing. There is coverage of trends and ratings, issues that often have no significance to anyone outside small groups of broadcasting execs sitting around a glass table in a sleek building somewhere in Toronto, Vancouver or Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next week I'll be in L.A. for the mid-season presentation by various network and cable outfits. As with so much TV these days, especially network TV, there is really only one focus. The focus is on getting the attention of that most desirable demographic – female, 25-54 (skewing 35-54), in white-collar occupations and with upscale HHI (household income) profiles within the $75K+ bracket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Got that? Good. And what series already has a massive audience in that very demographic? Well, it's on PBS and it comes under the “Masterpiece” banner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downton Abbey (Sunday, PBS, 9 p.m. on Masterpiece Classic) is a massive hit, by any standards. Networks would kill for the kind of devotion that viewers – especially female viewers – have for this strange and alluring soap opera. The first season of four episodes had an average of five million viewers in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mind you, the popularity of Downton is a mystery to many in the TV racket – why is it one of those rare series that viewers watch with unabashed pleasure? Trying to solve the mystery isn't easy. It has familiar elements of British series and movies – from Upstairs, Downstairs to Gosford Park – and nimbly weaves those elements into addictive storytelling. There is pathos and irony. There is nothing terrifically challenging or provocative. There are servants and masters. The setting is the grand English mansion, Downton. The first series opened in 1912. The Earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville), owner of Downton, and his American wife Cora (Elizabeth McGovern) and their three daughters no longer had a male heir to inherit the property. No one knew what would happen to the house, lands and servants. At regular intervals, the Earl's formidable mother (Maggie Smith), interfering and unhelpful, arrived to make caustic remarks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the servants, a plot to have the new valet fired went awry. What unfolded was England shifting course and changing. the old order dying slowly. The first series ended with the beginning of the First World War. As this new batch of episodes begins, it is 1916 and the war overwhelms everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whither the main characters? Some viewers will obsess on Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery), who found herself in bed with a dead Turkish chap in the first season and then had a tangled relationship with nice Matthew (Dan Stevens), whom the family wanted her desperately to marry, but things fell apart. Oh Mary, Mary. In the servants' quarters, scheming and conniving goes on and on. Uppity maids are put in their place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, it us established that life in the trenches is hell. For both the upper-class toffs and the servants who enlisted. A man who talks too much because he is going mad with despair is shot. Back at Downton, the ladies try to do their bit for the war effort, with some volunteering to tend to wounded soldiers. Will they be horrified? Oh yes. The chap in charge downstairs says things like, “I have information that I've no proper claim to.” He means that he's just heard something juicy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In truth, much of what happens in the new Downton Abbey is absolute nonsense. The craftiness of the storytelling, with all its twists and turns, seems less assured. Some twists, like the fate of nice Mr. Bates (Brendan Coyle), the troubled but noble valet, are outrageous and risible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet of course, the series will be consumed with gusto and great satisfaction by many viewers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over in Britain, where the Christmas Special episode of Downton set some sort of record for the number of viewers, the series makes some people very uneasy. In The Sunday Times, critic A.A. Gill wrote, “As a format and a concept, it is everything I despise and despair of on British television: National Trust sentimentality, costumed comfort drama that flogs an embarrassing, demeaning and bogus vision of the place I live in.” Still, he admired the craft in the storytelling. The series's creator, Julian Fellowes, reacted to criticism of the series by saying, “All we get is this permanent negative nitpicking from the left.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fellowes, a Conservative supporter, obviously sees debate about the show as political. He's right, but none of it matters. Will Lady Mary carry a torch for that nice Matthew? Oh yes. Rest assured, the romance lives on. The mystery of Downton Abbey is solved, right there. I think.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada does not need a national delirium over “excited delirium.” This supposed cause of many deaths in police custody, including those involving the use of tasers, was laid to rest after the exhaustive Braidwood inquiry following the 2007 death of the Polish immigrant Robert Dziekanski.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why then has an Alberta judge ruled that Gordon Bowe, tasered and restrained by several officers, died from “excited delirium syndrome”? Why is Judge Heather Lamoureux of Alberta Provincial Court proposing everything from the training of police dispatchers in diagnosing “excited delirium” to the creation of a countrywide “excited delirium” database?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Excited delirium” (overheating and wild behaviour) is a blind alley, not a recognized medical condition. It is a convenient way to avoid tough scrutiny of police practices that may contribute to death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Braidwood, a retired appeal court judge, spent two years and oversaw two inquiries, one on the overall safety concerns around the taser, and one on Mr. Dziekanski's brutal death after being tasered five times by the RCMP at the Vancouver International Airport. He spoke to experts in emergency medicine, cardiology, electrophysiology, pathology, epidemiology, psychology and psychiatry. Judge Lamoureux did not refer in her seven-page ruling to Mr. Braidwood's 1,000-plus page reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Braidwood concluded that “excited delirium” is not a medical condition. By contrast, delirium is a recognized cognitive and brain dysfunction that is a symptom of an underlying medical condition. This is not just semantics; it points to the real problem – dealing with a sick individual without killing him. “It is not helpful to blame resulting deaths on ‘excited delirium,' since this conveniently avoids having to examine the underlying medical condition or conditions that actually caused death, let alone examining whether use of the conducted energy weapon and/or subsequent measures to physically restrain the subject contributed to those causes of death.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bowe was on cocaine and acting wildly in a dark house. The tasering and heavy-handed restraint by Calgary police may or may not have been justified – though the judge should have questioned “kicks to the side of Mr. Bowe's body.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any policy built around “excited delirium” would be an irrational response to such a death. Judges and policy-makers should read Mr. Braidwood's reports.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was almost 14 years ago – when most of this edition of the world junior team was getting ready to enter kindergarten – that Canada faced the same sort of hockey challenge: trying to get motivated to play for a bronze medal, when all it really cared about was taking home gold.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tournament was the 1998 Winter Olympics and for the first time in history, Canada had entered a team of NHL professionals for the event in Nagano, Japan. Things were going pretty well, too. Canada swept through the preliminary rounds and then widely outplayed the Czech Republic in a semi-final game that went to a shootout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sadly, they could not find a way of getting a shot past goalie Dominik Hasek. Many lamented head coach Marc Crawford's decision to leave Wayne Gretzky on the bench for the shootout, but the way Hasek was playing– at the top of his game, in the midst of winning multiple Vézina Trophies – he probably could have given all 18 Canadian skaters a shot and not scored a goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loss left Canada playing Finland for the bronze – the team's only bad moment in the tournament.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between games, Canadian players muttered the gold-or-nothing mantra. It was clear they felt it, and it certainly showed against the Finns. Even though they outshot Finland 39-15, the sense of urgency that characterized their play earlier in the tournament was missing. (Also, a goaltender named Ari Sulander badly outplayed future Hockey Hall of Fame member Patrick Roy.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the way to the mixed zone, to interview players after that desultory loss, the International Ice Hockey Federation contingent was waiting in the wings, getting ready to present the Finns with their medals. Security wasn't then what it is now, and they permitted me to peer into the shiny boxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wondered at the time: Two years from now, or 10, or maybe even 30 down the road, would the Canadian players eventually regret that they allowed an opportunity for an Olympic medal to slip through their fingers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if it wasn't the desired colour, would it matter to their grandchildren? Probably not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Olympic medal is an Olympic medal and what was largely overlooked about Canada's Nagano experience was how well it played in the tournament overall. It was a point executive director Steve Yzerman made over and over in the run-up to the 2010 Vancouver Olympics: The 1998 Canadian Olympic team, which won nothing, might have been better than the 2002 team, which won everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The difference was in the timing of the games they won. In 2002, the Canadians sputtered through a 1-1-1 preliminary round, but drew Finland, Belarus and the United States in medal play – no Russians, no Czechs, no Swedes. Yzerman's point was, in a tournament with so many viable teams and so many variables that can decide a single game, sometimes it comes down to luck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canadian junior team's 6-5 loss to Russia on Tuesday, if Ryan Strome's last-gasp shot bounces off the goal post and into the net, it would have forced overtime and who knows how that might have turned out? Instead of Canada nursing the wounds of a nail-biting loss, maybe it would be celebrating another Jordan Eberle-in-2009-style, come-from-behind win.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeing the faces of the players postgame Tuesday, it was easy to understand their disappointment. (They held a 56-24 edge in shots.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why tournament organizers schedule a day in-between nowadays – to let the losing teams get over the disappointment and focus on the new goal: winning what you still can win.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That's the message coming across,” forward Brendan Gallagher said. “It may not seem all that important now, but 10 or 20 years down the road, that bronze medal sounds a lot better than fourth place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“No matter when you're playing or what game, you're going to go out there and play your hardest. We're playing for that crest on the front of our jersey and it's going to be a fun game to play in still – and we're really going to enjoy it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Watching how Gallagher conducts himself on and off the ice, there is little doubt he will be giving his all against a Finnish team Canada crushed 8-1 in the tournament opener. Nor was he the only one saying all the right things Wednesday, about preparation, about playing to win for all the right reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One can only hope they end up doing all the right things as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe not today, but somewhere down the road, they're going to be glad they did.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who knows? There could very well be nights when Tristan Thompson steps on the court at the Air Canada Centre and makes it his own. But Wednesday was not one of them. In the words of his head coach, he “didn't play well at all.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But,” Byron Scott added, “he was not the only one.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Toronto Raptors pounded Thompson and the Cleveland Cavaliers 92-77, a score that flattered the visitors. The Raptors held the Cavaliers to 29.6 per cent shooting from the field, not far off the two lowest opponents' figures in club history, including the lowest: a 23.9-per-cent performance by the San Antonio Spurs on Feb. 7, 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thompson, a native of Brampton, Ont., who was chosen fourth overall in last year's NBA draft, received a polite round of applause from an announced crowd of 14,468 when he entered the game with 10 minutes 51 seconds gone in the first quarter. It was a strangely subdued and in many ways disappointing response, considering Thompson is the highest-drafted Canadian-born player ever, and is widely considered to be the leader of the “next wave” of Canadian players who will take over from the likes of Steve Nash. They include the protégés of Ro Russell, whose Grassroots program is a pipeline to U.S. colleges and includes guards Myck Kabongo and Junior Cadougan among others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thompson was clearly out of sorts compared to his 12-point, five-rebound debut in the season opener against the Raptors. With 200 friends and family members looking on, the product of St. Marguerite d'Youville Secondary School, a pair of U.S.-based prep schools and the University of Texas went 0-for-5 in 16 minutes 27 seconds, scoring his only point from the free-throw line and collecting three rebounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Raptors were reminded before the game by head coach Dwane Casey that the Cavaliers' second unit led the NBA with 46.8 points off the bench. Among those who took the lesson to heart was James Johnson, who came into the game with Anthony Carter with 4 minutes 20 seconds left in the first quarter and the Cavaliers holding a 15-13 lead. DeMar DeRozan drained two jumpers to put the Raptors in front 21-18 by the end of the quarter and the Raptors kept coming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Every time we made a run they made a miracle three and broke our backs,” Scott said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrea Bargnani had 31 points and was 11-for-16 from the field with seven boards. DeRozan was 5-for-8 from three-point range and had 25 points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thompson, one of seven players with a year or less experience on a club that averages just 3.33 years experience, has carved out a niche for himself as part of that unit, averaging 9.8 points while shooting .553 from the floor and collecting 26 rebounds. He had career highs in a 115-101 win over the Charlotte Bobcats on Tuesday with 16 points and nine rebounds in 24 minutes. But this was his first experience playing back-to-back NBA games, something he'll need to get used to with the lockout-necessitated 66-game schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I didn't have any pressure at all, there are people who take care of that stuff for me,” Thompson said when asked if family demands might have interfered. “Coach Scott is honest. Him saying I didn't play well is true.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bizarrely, fans at the ACC spent more time booing Cavaliers rookie point guard Kyrie Irving, the first pick overall in the draft and a player many of them would have died for on draft day. But things change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When you have a young team like we have, you don't know about things until you go through it,” Scott said. “They now know how tough back-to-back games are, especially when it's in another city.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">History suggests Thompson will take it to heart.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My brother-in-law is a dumpster diver, only for the thrill of it and not because he needs to. Not really something I stress about; everyone has their own happy place. However, things gave cause for concern when his family's contribution to Christmas dinner was food from a dumpster. Still sealed, mind you, but publicly announced as a terrific find. I held my tongue (and gag reflex) and really wanted to say something to them but have no idea where to start. Is there any hope? How does one tactfully address this situation? Ugh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now I've officially heard it all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My hat's off, in a sense, to your brother-in-law. He's part of a growing movement of not-necessarily-from-necessity dumpster divers, also known as “freegans,” “urban harvesters” and “reclaimists,” and/or members of a “post-consumer society.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In just the past three years, there have been at least three documentaries made on the topic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dive! follows the adventures of director Jeremy Siefert as he rummages through the garbage of grocery stores in Los Angeles, then confronts supermarket owners over their wasteful ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Aussie film The Leftovers is kind of like a reclaimist Mad Max: Down-under divers take their rubbish-rummaging on the road in a vegetable-oil-fuelled car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in I Love Trash, two hard-core freegans rent an unfurnished apartment and, armed with just the clothes on their backs and a flashlight, feed and clothe themselves and furnish the apartment using only items cast off by others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dumpster diving has become almost kind of … hip. In a way, it's hard to argue with your brother-in-law's junk-spelunking. Here in Canada, we waste something like 40 per cent of all food produced. And of that, something like a quarter to a third is in unopened packages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having said that, maybe in raccoon society it's the acme of good manners to contribute refuse pried from a green bin to a family feast. Among humans, though, reclaimed garbage is not an acceptable “hostess gift” or potluck contribution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one thing, while there's no doubt your brother-in-law put some effort into his contribution (effort which may have included being covered in coffee grounds and banana peels, and throwing stinking, steaming, soiled diapers over his shoulder), it's the ultimate “re-gift.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he's kind of imposing his value system on his hosts in an in-your-face way. It's one thing to bring raw vegan pizza with cashew “cheeze” and/or a tofurkey to a potluck. Now people are going to start plopping down dumpster delicacies? Ixnay. I may be old school, but in my view, you soft-pedal your lifestyle choices when you cross the threshold of someone else's domicile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I would also question whether he's exposing anyone to health risks with his tossed-out offering. Maggots squirm and writhe around in our waste containers! Sealed or not, it could be spoiled, contaminated, or otherwise compromised. Some things are tossed out for a reason!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, yes, I would say at some point someone needs to talk trash with your brother-in-law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news: It needn't be you. In fact, I think it shouldn't be you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Brother-in-law” is an ambiguous term. He could be your sister's husband, your husband's brother, your brother's husband, your husband's sister's husband. In any case, there's someone out there who's closer to him than you are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the person who should talk to him. I mean, you can't be the only one squirming and cocking an eyebrow when he presents, with a flourish, “the gift of garbage.” (It's odd that no one else in this extended family has said anything. Is everyone too polite?)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His spouse, or sibling, should be the one to drop the knowledge on him that his “contributions” are déclassé and infra dig, even in these activist, Occupy-ed times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You're certainly within your rights to politely refuse when someone passes you the dumpster doughnuts. And maybe if enough folks do that he'll get the hint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in terms of confronting him, why stick your proboscis into a potential hornets' nest when you really don't have to? As my wife, Pam, often says: “Before you open your mouth, ask yourself: ‘What's the upside, what's the downside of what I'm about to say?'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this case, it's all downside. You risk offending him, ruffling feathers and causing family friction for something that really does not involve you, reflect on you or require your intervention in any way, shape or form.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bottom line: Take what you want to say to your brother-in-law re: his dumpster-diving gift-giving, stuff it in a bag, tie it up and toss it in the appropriate receptacle.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Design websites and lifestyle magazines will tell you this week the “colour of the year” has been chosen. It is a shade of orange. This will lead to lists of clothing and decor and nail polish you can buy that incorporate this fashionable shade, based on the premise that 2012 will be basically an all-orange year.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You may note in passing that this story has been entirely manufactured by a corporation called Pantone that happens to make pigments, and that the colour selected as the hippest this year is of course one of theirs, and that it is very much in Pantone's interest to convince you that there is such a thing as a fashionable colour and that you would be inadequate if you didn't think of colour in terms of fashion, but no matter, it is still a fascinating story because we all want to think like that, really: We want something to encapsulate the current moment, something emotional rather than intellectual, concrete rather than theoretical, something like a colour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The colour Pantone wants you to put on everything from your kitchen walls to your lips is called Tangerine Tango (Pantone No. 17-1463). The Pantone people based their choice on a survey of 100 fashion designers and stylists and buyers. They don't expose the panel of marketing gurus who came up with the name of the colour, which is of course as important as the shade itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These invisible, powerful creators get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to brainstorm poetic phrases and then dissect, like the most advanced of academic semioticians, the connotations of each word.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The point of releasing such a forecast now is to coincide with spring fashion shows (which did actually include a lot of orange) and to foreshadow the promotion of spring clothes in shops that is going to happen in a few short weeks. And this is why the chosen colour is so bright and springlike and its name so plosive and tripping and brisk (note not only the alliteration but the assonance, the repetition of the “a” sound). It's meant to be optimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And why, of course, wouldn't one be optimistic about 2012? All the global wars have been peacefully resolved, financial markets are stable and the economies of Europe and the United States seem to give no cause for concern. It's a great time to shop!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But why does orange mean optimism? Funny thing: To a lot of researchers, it doesn't. A marketing guy was once rather disdainful to me about a novel of mine because it had an orange cover. He said that in his business orange is used to signal an inexpensive product or a deep discount – this is why Tide detergent boxes have always been orange. You do see orange more at the low end of the consumer experience: at Pizza Pizza, for example, or Price Chopper or <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>. Orange to me tends to mean queuing at a cash register under fluorescent light and listening to Patio Lanterns, which is quite the opposite of cheerful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also a nostalgic colour: There were a lot of browns and burnt oranges in 1950s and 1960s design, and we're seeing them now romanticized in clothing-romance TV shows such as Mad Men or Pan Am. Last year's BBC drama series The Hour, the British answer to Mad Men, set in 1956, frequently has a yellowy-red hue to it – the bars in particular all seem to have orange shades over their lamps, and the drinkers carry amber drinks. It doesn't look luxurious. This show is constantly reminding one of the austerity of the era: the worn raincoats and the dripping hot-water heaters and the diet of chips and whisky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If orange is the colour of price cuts and rationing, it's also the colour of agitation. Restaurants with orange walls do not intend you to linger over your coffee. Roadwork crews use it to signal danger and delay. It's not a colour you'd want to paint a hospital waiting room. Well, anyway, here's to the symbolism of fashion: tangoing the new year away in a burst of happy cheap frantic chemical tangerine.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the candidates for the Republican presidential nomination trading nasty barbs and preparing to do battle next in New Hampshire and South Carolina, front-runner Mitt Romney is basking in a new-found aura of inevitability.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Newt Gingrich's acid remarks about the former Massachusetts governor on Wednesday suggest Mr. Romney will face an onslaught of attacks as he seeks to wrap up the nomination by the time Florida Republicans vote in their Jan. 31 primary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The fact is, three out of four Republicans rejected him,” Mr. Gingrich said of Mr. Romney's Tuesday win in the Iowa caucuses with only 25 per cent of the vote. “I find it amazing the news media continues to say he's the most electable Republican when he can't even break out of his own party.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Mr. Romney's photo-finish win over Rick Santorum on Tuesday night exposed key weaknesses in the ex-Massachusetts governor's candidacy that could come back to haunt him in coming primaries. And they could resurface if Mr. Romney does get to face off against President Barack Obama in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Romney's inability to connect with Republicans on a level that rises above a clinical economic pitch could leave all American voters cold in November, especially if a recovery takes hold by then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless the U.S. economy is so far underwater next November that Mr. Obama is doomed from the outset, the presidential election promises to be a cliffhanger. Mr. Romney will need more to run on than his résumé at <span class="companylink">Bain Capital</span>, which is all he has done until now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the race for the Republican nomination, Mr. Romney has narrowed his pitch to a single selling point – namely, that he is the turnaround artist needed to get the economy going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may be all he needs to win next week in New Hampshire, where he holds a 25-point lead in the polls in the run-up to the Granite State's GOP primary on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a general election, sticking to that narrow focus could be risky. Mr. Santorum, the pious father of seven and ex-Pennsylvania senator who finished eight votes shy of a win in Tuesday's caucuses, showed why.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His speech on Tuesday helped the GOP establishment understand how, without money or organization, Mr. Santorum won the hearts of 25 per cent of Iowa's GOP caucus-goers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Santorum spoke of his Italian-born grandfather who worked in a coal mine, and recalled hovering, as a child, over his coffin, staring at his “enormous” hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And all I could think was, those hands dug freedom for me,” he told the crowd, before segueing into an explanation about why his humble roots would allow him to win over working-class voters in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Those are the same people that President Obama talked about who cling to their guns and their Bibles. Thank God they do,” he asserted. “They share our values about faith and family. They understand that when the family breaks down, the economy struggles.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Santorum's 15 minutes will likely soon expire, just as they did for every other tentative alternative to Mr. Romney for the GOP nomination in the past six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has yet to bear the brunt of negative ads or face intense media scrutiny. Given the increasing ugliness of this campaign, Mr. Santorum is bound to get caught up in the nastiness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, his Senate career, which ended in defeat in 2006, was marked by a rigid social conservatism that ultimately made him too hot to handle for his own constituents. His rivals are already calling him one of the worst pork-barrellers in Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But juxtaposing his Tuesday night speech with that of Mr. Romney exposes the weakness in the ex-Massachusetts governor's argument – namely its emotional emptiness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I will go to work to get America back to work by making America once again the most attractive place in the world for job creators and innovators and investors,” Mr. Romney told the crowd in Des Moines. “I'll keep our tax rates competitive.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No doubt, the consultants who drive Mr. Romney's campaign have tested these sentences in focus groups and found them to be effective with an economically scarred electorate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Americans do not want their leader to act as if he is battery-operated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama has spent much of his presidency appearing as if he, too, might have a lithium-ion power pack under the hood. But he has the personal narrative and oratorical prowess to step up his campaign game when needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the Romney campaign sees no need to alter its game plan. As long as he has an increasingly unhinged Ron Paul calling Mr. Gingrich a “chicken hawk,” as he did Wednesday, and Mr. Gingrich spewing venom in all directions, as he does every day, it is hard to see how über-disciplined Mr. Romney can lose this race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that does not mean the Tin Man won't also need a heart to win in November.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some ways, the world junior hockey championship has become a victim of its own success.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least as far as Team Canada 2012 is concerned, knocked silly for two periods in the first true test it faced and then, once it finally found itself, not quite able to mount the comeback that would have taken it for the 11th consecutive year into the gold-medal game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's not the end of the world,” Canada head coach Don Hay said Wednesday morning at the Hockey Canada practice complex here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it most assuredly isn't. Far from it, considering this young and healthy team of future millionaires still has a chance to make it 14 years in a row on the podium – including five consecutive gold medals – Thursday afternoon when it meets Finland to decide the bronze medal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Not many teams,” Hay added unnecessarily, “that can say they came away from this tournament with a medal.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just three of the 10 – and that may be where some discussion might take place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no denying the success of the world junior tournament, especially when it is played in hockey-mad Canada. The 2012 organizers believe they will set tournament records in attendance (600,000 tickets), in revenues ($80-million plus), in 50/50 draws (a win equals the price of a new home in most other parts of the country) and perhaps even in television viewership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To no one's surprise, the tournament has grown. There are more teams, now 10 where there were once eight, and it goes on for a long two weeks. The teams get divided into two groups – one in Edmonton this year, one in Calgary – and while the divisions are dictated by the results of the year before, it can prove sadly out of balance, as was the case in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You play the games you are scheduled to play,” Hay said Wednesday without saying anything more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So let us expand for him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada played Finland, Czech Republic, Denmark and the United States. The hockey in Edmonton was dismal, for the most part. The Canadians ended the round with an aggregate score of 26-5. They were never challenged, never tested, though they pretended to have met “adversity” briefly New Year's Eve when the Americans came within a goal in a 3-2 Canadian win.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They saw no adversity whatsoever. The Americans came back because the game had already been rendered meaningless. The Canadians had a 3-0 lead and lost focus just as a little U.S. pride kicked in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In never losing in Edmonton, the Canadians arrived in Calgary with a bye straight into the semi-final, straight up against the speedy, skilled, determined Russians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We kind of didn't know how to deal with it,” said goaltender Scott Wedgewood, who was pulled before the game was half over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They figured it out, though – as so often happens to Canadian players – and they became a true team in the third period and nearly pulled off perhaps the greatest upset in tournament history. But it was too late.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What, however, if they had only been truly challenged before the semi-final? Ten teams is too many, especially considering the weakness of the likes of Latvia and Denmark. There has even been a proposal – heaven forbid – to go to 12 teams and a longer tournament.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada might have been far better off not to have had that bye. It might have benefited from having to play in the quarter-finals on Monday, as Russia had. One more chance to find that elusive team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Olympics can be used as a fair guide, history suggests that a little early adversity, true adversity, is exactly what Canadian hockey players thrive on. At the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City, Canada lost in the early going 5-2 to Sweden and had to play Finland in the quarter-final. It squeaked through with a 2-1 victory, then whipped Belarus 7-1 in the semi-final and won the gold medal with a convincing 5-2 victory over the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly at the Vancouver Games in 2010, Canada lost early to a strong U.S. team, 5-3, beat Russia in the quarter-finals 7-3 and barely survived a late surge by spunky Slovakia to win the semi-final match 3-2. The NHL stars won their second Olympic gold by beating the Americans 3-2 on Sidney Crosby's overtime goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In both instances, the Canadians were tested early and also had that extra game in which to find their team personality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Something that took until the third period of a must-win game in Calgary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And by then it was too late.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With this week's Iowa caucuses, the presidential season begins in earnest. An American presidential campaign is splendid entertainment, but it's also diversionary and we can't expect much attention to our agenda. If we're to realize the promises of the December border agreement designed to improve our economic competitiveness, we have work to do in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Oval Office remains the best entry point for Canadian interests. It's the one relationship that every prime minister has to get right, and Stephen Harper has demonstrated this ability both with George W. Bush and Barack Obama.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Closing on the border deal is the priority for our embassy and our network of consulates. With their technical ability to demonstrate the linkage between jobs, exports to Canada (still America's first market) and Canadian investment for each legislative district, Ambassador Gary Doer will be the chief advocate as well as the control point for a co-ordinated outreach to Congress and state legislators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As we learned long ago with the experience of the still-born East Coast Fisheries Agreement, we need to make our case starting with Capitol Hill. This means a thousand points of contact: legislators and their staff, and also the permanent staff of the committees, agencies and departments within the Beltway. They're critical on regulatory issues and the all-important “interpretation” of the rules for those in the field.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Passage of the free-trade agreement was a near-run thing, and it depended on the cultivation of “white knights” such as senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Bill Bradley. We need to develop champions within Congress, and this is where Canadian ministers and legislators need to cultivate and solidify relationships, beginning with those representing the northern border states, where many of the pilots will take place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The regional conferences of premiers and governors and provincial and state legislators are important forums. Given the deepening integration, we should aim to make a discussion of Canada-U.S. relations a standing item on the agenda of the National Governors Association. Intervention by the premiers with their governor counterparts was instrumental in securing the 2010 reciprocity agreement on procurement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The long-term success of the deal lies as much in addressing the “tyranny of small differences” afflicting our goods, services and people as with the challenges they encounter at the border. While the deal was crafted by Barack Obama's administration to avoid submitting implementing legislation to Congress, we would be making a mistake if we relied solely on the administration. Behind a regulation, there often stands a protectionist interest, and behind the protectionist interest stands a congressman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our success ratio rises in proportion to the perception that it's both an American issue and vital to their national security, as we are currently witnessing with the Keystone XL pipeline debate. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been especially vocal in encouraging the administration to approve the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chamber of Commerce and like-minded associations, including the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers, need to be encouraged to devote commensurate attention to highlighting the importance of cross-border supply-chain dynamics. So, too, with the union movement, a vital constituency in the Democratic coalition, that has also been active in support of the XL pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of these initiatives will contribute to building the conditions for passage of the border deal. Given the immense complexity of the deal and the constraints of time and competition for time, we also recommend the appointment of special envoys. They would report directly to the President and the Prime Minister and drive its implementation during the next 12 months. The acid rain agreement wouldn't have been achieved without the appointment of former Ontario premier Bill Davis and former transportation secretary Drew Lewis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such appointments would signal the priority the two leaders attach to the achievement of this deal. To represent Canada, we can think of no one possessing a better appreciation and the experience of successfully working both systems, as well as the gravitas, guile and good humour to get it done, than Brian Mulroney.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm a food snob – and I want my kid (an eight-year-old boy) to develop discerning tastes. My wife, though, wants to stick to the basics – meat and potatoes, mac and cheese.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's your take?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I tend to agree with your wife's approach, but at the same time you need to be commended for paying extra attention to the quality of what you eat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your wife's selection of foods for your child is a good start. I tell families to always begin with the common-sense basics and then, as the child gets more independent, one can introduce more exotic foods – what you call food for snobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the most useful studies ever published on how young children consume food is called FITS – Feeding Infants and Toddler Study. It revealed that our children are not getting enough daily servings of fruits and vegetables; they eat too many sweetened cereals; their snacks have too many calories and are too high in sugar; they do not get enough whole grains; they fall short in their lean protein intake but their dairy intake seem to be just right. These habits may get worse as the child gets older.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are looking for online resources to help in family meal planning go to www.choosemyplate.gov[http://www.choosemyplate.gov], which offers plenty of ideas on the composition of an ideal plate. This website, which is run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is like a Swiss Army knife – many tools in one place. From one single page, parents can electronically find additional ideas of how to provide an ideal variety of foods on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question that intrigues many experts is just how early we can program a child's taste buds. Research published by the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia suggests that what mothers eat during pregnancy can influence the taste buds of the fetus developing in her womb. For instance, one study showed that moms who drank carrot juice during pregnancy gave birth to babies who were more likely to be very receptive to eating carrots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since you consider yourself to be a food snob, you may want to teach your son how to grow his own healthy foods. Planting produce in your backyard or a community garden (which exist in some cities) is a way to engage your son in what he eats. And fresh vegetables from your own garden tend to taste a lot better than produce purchased at a supermarket. Research the benefits of organic gardening and share these ideas with your child.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In what can be described as an Israeli take on Canada's “reasonable accommodation” debate, Israel's military finds itself torn between two apparently irreconcilable processes: equality of opportunity for female soldiers, and religious accommodation of Orthodox male soldiers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a “citizens army” of compulsory conscripts from virtually all dimensions of Israeli society (18-year-old men serve three years, women two), the Israel Defence Forces provide a mirror into the values of the day and, in turn, influence public discourse on them. What happens there can't be ignored because nearly every household is in some way connected to the IDF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither gender equality nor religious accommodation are new to the military (or society at large, for that matter), but the juxtaposition of more religious soldiers and more women in combat units and training positions has brought the issue to a head and sparked a new round of public debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gender equality for female soldiers has been high on the agenda since the 1995 landmark Supreme Court “Alice Miller” decision (named for the appellant who challenged her rejection from pilot training on gender grounds) barring exclusion of women from any military role they could physically perform. The ruling led to seminal changes in the placement of women: If they once served largely in administrative support roles, they now serve in 90 per cent of military jobs, with the exception of core fighting units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Israel has never had formal separation of religion and state, and the IDF has a series of religious accommodation practices that allow observant male and female soldiers to serve without compromising their religious lifestyle. But demographics are now challenging rules that worked in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Religious Israelis have larger families and, in the past decade, in an effort to achieve positions of influence as career officers, more soldiers from the religious nationalist community have volunteered for elite combat units. Highly motivated and educated, they make up 50 per cent of the IDF's junior command and more than 20 per cent of senior ranks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many live in West Bank settlements and studied in religious academies led by charismatic hard-line rabbis they see as their ultimate leaders. When these rabbis publicly reject standing military orders (ranging from the treatment of hostile civilians to stringent lifestyle demands), soldiers are caught between two sources of authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest round of controversy was sparked by the refusal of religious soldiers to attend events with female vocalists on the grounds that a woman singing was immodest. But the problem goes far deeper – to soldiers who feel uncomfortable with female instructors and officers who prefer to hire male juniors to avoid the prospect of being alone with a female colleague.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of soldiers from the religious nationalist community makes it impossible to ignore the issue. So far, the IDF leadership, including its chief chaplain, Rafi Peretz (a former combat pilot who rejects any efforts to weaken women's positions), is standing firm in support of gender equality. And in a form of poetic justice, Orna Barbivai, Israel's first female major-general and head of the IDF's human resources command, chairs the committee reassessing the issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the army's chief of staff, Lieutenant-General Benny Gantz, said the IDF remains committed to integrating women into every military role they can perform, while accommodating religious soldiers. His oxymoronic statement starkly expressed the conundrum he's in. But as an open democracy at war and a state that's grappled with religious-secular differences from day one, Israel and the IDF have ample precedent for pragmatic compromises that blunt the edge of absolute principles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing is clear: In the choice between gender equality and religious accommodation in the army, the public at large will support the former over the latter.</p>

Previewing his coming report, Don Drummond publicly pronounced that economic growth had permanently stagnated under Mr. McGuinty's watch, meaning the province's entire model of program spending was no longer sustainable. And by the way, some of the Premier's proudest investments – smaller class sizes, for instance – were poor value and should be reversed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on Thursday, Mr. McGuinty and his advisers were sanguine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were evidently prepared for the stories that ran that morning in The Globe and Mail and the Toronto Star, likely because they were in the loop about Mr. Drummond giving interviews. And they seemed perfectly happy for the Premier to spend his first public event of the year talking about the economist's broadsides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To understand why that is, it helps to bear in mind that – from the perspective of Mr. McGuinty and his Finance Minister, Dwight Duncan – Mr. Drummond's commission on public-service reform is increasingly being viewed as an exercise in table-setting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government might have hoped, when it struck the commission last spring, that answers to get out of deficit would be provided. But while it still might find considerable value in many of the report's roughly 400 recommendations, the report is unlikely to be the blueprint for the next provincial budget. Instead, the Liberals are clearly hoping that Mr. Drummond's doom-and-gloom will provide political cover for their own, somewhat milder austerity plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals probably won't commit to getting annual spending increases in health care below 3 per cent, as Mr. Drummond has proposed; they certainly won't scrap their own signature education policies. If they reject Mr. Drummond's unusually pessimistic forecast of 2-per-cent economic growth in perpetuity, and bring in some additional revenues by cancelling planned corporate tax cuts, they should generally be able to promise fewer cutbacks than the ones Mr. Drummond will call for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with a $16-billion deficit, and credit agencies threatening downgrades, whatever the government comes up with still won't be an easy sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not to the workers in the broader public-sector – doctors and teachers among them – whose contracts will be up for negotiation this year. Not to the general public, which was hardly well-served by a recent election campaign in which all three provincial parties glossed over the leaner times ahead. And not to many Liberals themselves, including some of the ones around the cabinet table, who hardly got into public life because they were looking to cut things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those realities will be a little harder to deny now that Mr. Drummond is using his commission's platform to more or less pronounce that the province is in crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Mr. McGuinty will be able to point to Mr. Drummond's proposals as he tries to make his own more palatable. Where the economist has recommended what the Liberals planned to do anyway, his report will provide justification. And his more draconian ideas will be pointed to as grim inevitabilities if the Liberals' alternatives aren't adopted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, Mr. McGuinty's decision to appoint the commission could still blow up in his face. If Ontarians look closely at what Mr. Drummond has to say – at his implicit (and in some cases direct) criticism of the Liberals' record – they might reconsider the steady-hand pitch that helped the Premier get re-elected this past fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. McGuinty is making the best of a bad situation. And this week's communications, however counterintuitively, were viewed by his office as a good start.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dominant political force in the United States in recent years – the Tea Party movement – appeared to have lost much of its swagger and most of its influence as Republicans began the formal process of choosing their presidential candidate at the Iowa caucuses this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From its spontaneous creation in early 2009, the Tea Party movement eagerly expressed the anger Americans felt at their loss of prestige and buying power after the 2008 financial meltdown. Big government and taxation were to blame; big spending cuts the only cure.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite its over-simplification of conservatism, the Tea Party became the most important story of the 2010 mid-term elections. Tea Party adherents swamped Republican nomination meetings and replaced long-time incumbents with rookie candidates who shared a singular focus on making government smaller. Since the success of 2010, however, the tide has been turning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago more Americans agreed with the Tea Party movement (27 per cent) than disagreed (20 per cent), according to a Pew Research Center poll. Now those numbers are exactly reversed. The results from Iowa suggest a continuation of this trend. The candidates most closely identified with the Tea Party, Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry, found themselves far behind. The libertarian Ron Paul finished a respectable third, but remains a long shot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two best-positioned candidates coming out of Iowa are Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum – the least preferred among Tea Partiers. Mr. Romney's strong showing among non-Tea Party Republicans secured his narrow victory in the Hawkeye state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline of a grassroots movement without any central organization is not surprising in 2012. It is one thing to take over congressional nomination meetings, another to control the entire primary process. The establishment still matters when it comes to picking a presidential nominee, and Mr. Romney is very much the establishment candidate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it is now obvious the Tea Party's stridency has added to the gridlock and intransigence in Washington. While it brought necessary attention to the country's fiscal crisis, voters have come to realize the movement is sorely lacking in compromise and imagination. A strong brew is not the answer to America's problems.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When last seen on-air before his Christmas break, Prime Time Sports host Bob McCown was hinting broadly that, lacking a new contract, this might be his final appearance on the Sportsnet Radio Fan 590 flagship program. To the amusement of co-host Stephen Brunt, McCown wrote the number 30 on a piece of paper (30 in journalistic shorthand means end). Even as he performed this bit of low comedy, McCown had a wry grin on his face. After all, he … we have been down this road before.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McCown was back in his usual chair Wednesday as host of the long-running program on The Fan and Sportsnet TV. A new deal must have been reached in a breakneck last-minute session over the holidays, right? “We're still working on it,” McCown told Usual Suspects on Thursday. “I can't say much more than that, really.” Are there other suitors for his services? “Look, people call from time to time, but I can't be more specific. We're working on it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McCown is in a strong position. In the battle between The Fan and upstart TSN Radio, he is the linchpin. As long as the veteran broadcaster holds forth from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. ET, the coveted 25-54 male audience belongs to the Fan. Take him away from the station and everything is in play. And while he won't say as much, McCown isn't going anywhere soon. (Other sources tell us the deal may already be done.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which doesn't mean he isn't as irascible as ever. The recent Bell/Rogers corporate co-mingling in the purchase of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd., still sticks in his craw. “I don't know what to make of it,” he says in a phone interview. “We spend six months rebranding Sportsnet with new hosts and graphics and talking about going after TSN. Then this. It doesn't feel right for those of us brought up to believe you're supposed to kill the competition. It takes the air out of the balloon for those of us on the firing lines.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And should Maple Leafs GM Brian Burke take umbrage with McCown, who will the bosses placate first now that both men are paid by Rogers? “That's a really good question,” McCown allows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McCown says that, on the level of the radio grunts, competition has never been fiercer. He lost several regular guests such as Dan Shulman and Lester Munson when ESPN (which owns a piece of TSN) told its employees that they could no longer appear on The Fan. “I know a couple of them who refuse to do TSN rather than be told who they can talk to,” McCown says. “Maybe we need to start telling Blue Jays guys like [general manager] Alex Anthopoulos that they can't appear on TSN. [Rogers owns the Blue Jays.] I'm tired of being bullied.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(For the record, TSN Radio sources have told Usual Suspects that they're tired of The Fan scooping their regular guests.) Expect more McCown. And wait till he pulls hard enough on Burke's tail. It'll be worth tuning in.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a personal level, the NDP offers a fine group of leadership candidates. They're committed politicians, dedicated to the public interest as they perceive it. In one form or another, all are bilingual, most of them impressively so. Parties should be so lucky to have such a choice. Frankly, it's doubtful the Liberals or Conservatives could field a group of eight such intelligent candidates.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listening to them and reading their policy papers (such as they are) reminds Canadians of what to like about the NDP, and what to fear. What to like is the emphasis on inclusion in politics and greater equality of opportunity for the marginalized and dispossessed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time of growing inequality, it's imperative that political actors put the issue front and centre on the national agenda. It's also important that some party keep hammering away on the environment, especially climate change. So, kudos to the NDP for supporting a cap-and-trade system for Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's not to like, however, is the old NDP bugbear: The party is much better at thinking about how to redistribute wealth than create it. Running through the party's leadership discourse is continuing skepticism about the free market, free trade and the globalized economy. About the only idea that candidates offer for wealth creation is a kind of public investment fund, or a public infrastructure fund. For those of an entrepreneurial bent in Canada or those trying to get ahead on their investments, the party offers nothing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the candidates prefer industrial policies to freer markets, clearly distrust large businesses, whose tax rates they wish to raise sharply, and prefer something called “fair trade” to free trade, which invariably means the party winds up opposing free-trade deals. For a deeply trade-dependent economy such as Canada, that systematic hostility is utterly counterproductive – especially given the importance of diversifying Canada's excessive dependence on the U.S. market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Latent protectionism lies deep in the NDP's soul. So does the belief that government is there not just to provide public services and to regulate private activity, but to direct private investment, inject public money into enterprises, and generally try to steer the economy with public funds, public regulations and trade protection. It's a very old recipe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not surprising that NDP candidates should take this view of the world, since some of the prominent ones (Peggy Nash and Brian Topp, for example) come from the trade union world. But that world, numerically speaking, is a dwindling one. It has also been changing, as public-sector unions become ever-more prominent within the labour movement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naturally, therefore, the NDP is locked into the belief that public services can only be delivered in the traditional public-sector union manner, meaning that the interests of providers, and not necessarily those of taxpayers, are at the heart of the way these public services are structured and delivered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP candidates are certainly not alone in making promises for which no money is easily available. Their campaign documents are full of such pledges, with the only revenue source apparently being a rollback of corporate tax cuts. Alas, the money recaptured from that rollback couldn't possibly finance all their commitments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Topp moved out from the pack by proposing very big tax increases not just on corporations but on individuals being paid more than $250,000 and making money from capital gains and stock options. Mr. Topps figures his tax hikes would raise $18-billion, but his number assumes (wrongly) that people and companies wouldn't rearrange their affairs to minimize the tax hit. Nor is there any assumption these higher taxes might dampen economic activity, when it's shown that changes to tax rates, up or down, affect personal and corporate decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least Mr. Topp has explained where he'd try to find the billions he'd require for all the new spending on public services and programs. His is the classic social democratic model, largely abandoned in Europe and in provinces where the NDP governs or has governed, but one that apparently remains dear to the hearts of some federal New Democrats.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the political calculus of an American presidential campaign, it is an accepted equation: Candidate plus spouse and family equals a heartwarming domestic narrative.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney appeared this week before his supporters to claim his teeny eight-vote victory in the Iowa caucuses, the woman at his side, wearing a bright red jacket and an even brighter smile, stepped forward to take her place in a titanic struggle that could become as compelling as the contest for the presidency itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ann Romney, 61, introduced her husband as the “next president of the United States.” Which makes her the next possible first lady. As such, she definitely has her work cut out for her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her job – as is the duty of all would-be presidential consorts in an American system that seems not to have heard of spouses who lead their own engrossing lives – is to humanize her rather stiff husband, or, paradoxically to add spine to a man who has pandered so heavily to the extreme right, reversing his former pro-choice position, among others, that The Economist caustically described him this week as one “who still seems several vertebrae short of a backbone.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is also to offer up a domestic narrative that makes Americans feel good about themselves by choosing it. Look at the Obamas, that stunning family tableau on election night in Chicago in 2008, of the then handsome president-elect, his gleaming wife Michelle, a poised professional woman, their two adorable daughters, African-American above all. Americans swooned, they oohed and aahed. “We put them there,” they said, inordinately proud of themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, it took Michelle Obama, a lawyer by training, a while to catch on to the arcane wife-of rules during that volatile primary season, in which she was first derided as an “angry black woman,” or unpatriotic, or a bit too honest about her husband's morning breath.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now she's mastered the first-lady thing, spearheading a kids' nutrition campaign, coming across most of all as a concerned mother, and as a supportive but not subservient partner to her husband in what appears to be a vibrant, modern marriage. She is the third most admired woman in America, bested only by Oprah in second place, and ironically, by Hillary Clinton, her husband's former political foe, in first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ann Romney's story is a poignant one: As a college student whose father was a Welsh immigrant, she converted to the Mormon faith under the tutelage of her formidable father-in-law, former Michigan governor George Romney, while her beau Mitt was off in France doing missionary work. (Imagine asking the French to sign on to a religion that doesn't allow you to drink wine.) Didn't JFK's shrewd and scheming father also develop a special bond with Jackie? These political patriarchs, they know what their sons need to go for the brass ring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A stay-at-home wife and the mother of five strapping grown sons, Mrs. Romney was diagnosed in 1997 with multiple sclerosis, and as she and her husband of 42 years recently told CNN's Wolf Blitzer during a cozy interview, it was the “darkest hour” of their lives. She was very ill back then and, although she is much improved by a combination of traditional and non-traditional medicine, still has to manage serious fatigue, which makes the rigours of a presidential campaign possibly akin to climbing Mt. Everest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I said we can deal with anything so long as it's not terminal,” recalled Mr. Romney. “Ann's my life.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His wife, who also successfully battled breast cancer in 2008, in turn said how “comforting” it was to know that “Mitt is always by my side.” You've had a wonderful marriage,” enthused Mr. Blitzer at one point. Yes, it was a strategic interview, but it was also moving, and came across as authentic in a way that Mitt Romney has never seemed thus far in his quest for the presidency. His wife seems dignified, straightforward, and quietly her own person.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the rare woman in middle age who hasn't had to deal with a significant health challenge, so Ann Romney's story will resonate, as will her murmured promise to “move the ball forward on MS.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these are early days. Mr. Romney still has to bat back the latest comer, raving family-values guy Rick Santorum, whose own domestic details – doesn't believe in any birth control whatsoever, seven kids home-schooled, youngest daughter with a serious birth defect, saga of a stillborn son – have attracted significant notice. As The New York Times's Gail Collins drolly remarked, “large attractive families are a dime a dozen this year.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You rarely, if ever, in the highest echelon of American presidential politics, see an unattractive or highly imperfect spouse. By that point, they have been winnowed out. Newt Gingrich, for example, in his search for the ultimate political spouse, has gone through the kind of iterations most Japanese auto companies have undertaken, to arrive where he is today, with his third wife Callista, whose perfect blond helmet of hair should have its own entry on a ballot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It worried me that Michele Bachmann's husband, Marcus, by her own telling, was “out buying doggy sunglasses” on her last day of campaigning, so it was a good thing she dropped out, sparing them further scrutiny.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the day after Mitt Romney won the Iowa caucuses, the Daily Beast's Lloyd Grove burbled that Ann Romney, “resplendent” in red, “will be a formidable humanizing force in the battles to come – perhaps this campaign's Tipper Gore.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal Liberal convention, which arrives in Ottawa on Jan. 13, will be a seminal event. Does it matter if the party survives? Few would say so with much passion, but I think it does matter. Failing that, we'll be left with ideologues of the left and right. Liberals, by contrast, have few principles beyond survival and power, which at least makes for a keen attention to the public good.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A significant part of the Liberal future will be decided at the convention. This has nothing to do with policy. These proposals are the usual mix of motherhood and political correctness (save a call for legalized marijuana), tax-and-spend big government, and a country run out of Ottawa. No, the big question, going to the survival of the party, is a constitutional one: How will the next leader be chosen?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why should this matter? Because the party establishment proposal is for a new system looking a whole lot like the American primaries that crowd our TV screens these days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get a feel for it, one need only look south. Just about anyone could sign up, for free and at the last minute, to get a vote for the new Liberal leader. Regional primaries would be held over a period of weeks (as in the U.S., even culminating in a Super Saturday) to generate a sense of drama and regional identity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National Liberal president Alfred Apps says this would “reconnect Liberalism with millions of disaffected and disengaged Canadians,” and be an opportunity for more unknown candidates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, maybe. It's a nice dream. But it's not without its shadows. One need only look at the current Republican primary circus to see some of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An obvious problem is that this system calls for the party leader to be chosen mostly by those who know very little about the person. And one need not believe that these newbies would linger to help the new person. The party is famous for the thousands of “instant Liberals” who show up to support this or that ethnic or religious candidate, never to be seen again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second worrying possibility is turnout. A maxim of politics is that one books a smaller hall for a meeting than the numbers expected to give a sense of crowd and excitement. But this primary “hall” is in the millions. What if no one showed up or cared enough about the leadership to take part? Or what if mainly special interests showed up?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also the matter of knowledge. Proper assessment of candidates takes time and experience. Indeed, that's why we've had political parties until now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And forgive a political science thing: The primary process would bring a party leader even closer to the stature of the U.S. president, beholden only to the people (which means to no one) and not to the party, a potential prime minister all-powerful. At least the president has to deal with Congress rather than a supine parliamentary majority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think the Liberals would be better off looking at Resolution 18 submitted by the Ontario Liberal Party. This calls for a Renewal Commission (like the Reform Commission of 1985) that would take a thoughtful look at this primary concept and other ideas. This is too important for the precipitous action now proposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no hurry on this. The next election will not be until 2015. Study the possibilities (including the old, delegated convention) throughout 2012, adopt a system in 2013, choose a leader in 2014 and go into the election with momentum. Makes more sense.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Burke's new owners might want to gently remind him that his first job is to make the playoffs instead of trying to prevent the extinction of the NHL's dinosaurs.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Colton Orr, most people see a player of heavily disguised talent given $1-million (all currency U.S.) a year over four years by Burke to beat people up, but the general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs sees a cause célèbre. Thursday, ahead of a game against the Winnipeg Jets, Burke contemplated the prospect of sending Orr down to the American Hockey League Toronto Marlies after Orr had cleared waivers. While most teams would have said adios with a one-paragraph press release, Burke said: “When a player the character of Colton Orr can't contribute in this league, I'm not sure I like where the league is going.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was less a rant than an expression of sadness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So now on top of everything else – inventing his own moral code about player acquisition, commenting on how everybody else in the league conducts his business, worrying more about how teams are screwing each other with salary-cap machinations than jumping into the fray – Burke has added another cause to the list, and this time it's the granddaddy of lost NHL causes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that there isn't reason to worry about Orr. He suffered a concussion on Jan. 20 in a staged fight against George Parros of the Anaheim Ducks and has taken several blows to the head en route to collecting 921 penalty minutes in 378 games. Knowing what we know now about the mental and physical toll taken on the hockey goon, who wouldn't be worried?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Burke's concern was that no NHL team, including the Leafs, had a place for Orr.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm not throwing stones,” Burke said, making it clear that if there were “no dance partners” for Orr on a given night, it made greater sense to dress players such as Darryl Boyce or Joey Crabb. Yes, the general manager of a team actually lamented that he had to dress more talented players with at least a modicum of hockey skills over a guy whose best asset is throwing punches. Wow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I know the Greenpeace folks will be happy with this,” Burke said, “but I wonder where we're going when [NHL vice-president of discipline] Brendan Shanahan's got six hearings every two days.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Leafs were in the middle of a losing streak, this could be dismissed as Burke running interference for his good friend and head coach Ron Wilson. But apparently it was too much watching the Tampa Bay Lightning's Steve Downie try to sucker Dion Phaneuf and other Leafs into fights in Tuesday's 7-3 Toronto win.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So even though game officials did their job and Downie spent 20 minutes in the penalty box to put his already short-handed team at a huge disadvantage, Burke worried that “if we don't have the guys looking after each other, then the rats will take this game over.” There will be, in his words, “no checks and balances.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He worried about “accountability,” and if anybody wondered whether the redundancy of Orr and fellow knuckleduster Jay Rosehill meant Burke was undergoing some kind of conversion and was no longer the Dark Lord of Truculence, wonder no more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a dangerous turn in our game,” Burke said of the diminishing role of fighters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">God forbid that regular-season game No. 589 turn into one of those boring games played at a playoff pace absent the good fun of staged fights and line brawls, where a clean hit on a fourth-line player doesn't mean somebody has to square up to somebody else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You want a dangerous turn? A dangerous turn is giving ownership reason to question whether the game is passing you by at a time when you'll be life and death to make the playoffs. Because when that happens, it is the messenger who gets old as well as the message.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, at least Burke didn't give Orr a contract extension. Been enough of those golden handshakes lately.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike many native groups who occupy relatively isolated areas, surrounded by forested Crown land, Tsawwassen natives are hemmed in by a coal port, a ferry terminal and the municipality of Delta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they sneeze, other residents of the Lower Mainland can catch cold. Now, we are beginning to learn what that means.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long gone are hunting, gathering and the old ways of aboriginal life. The new name of the game is development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the TFN's plan to boldly go where no B.C. native group has gone before, a heretofore placid pocket of mostly rural land, ceded to them by the province, will be transformed into a hectic hub of commerce, housing and industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Projects include an industrial park to complement the nearby Deltaport, housing for an estimated 4,000 new residents over the next decade, and development of a mega shopping mall on land that was previously part of the province's cherished Agricultural Land Reserve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's time for profits, not turnips.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They are going to do more to change the face of Delta in the next 10 years than what happened over the last 200 years,” fumed Delta Councillor Ian Paton in an interview with a local newspaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy analyst Neil Salmond, a member of a research centre at the University of British Columbia's Sauder School of Business, was also aghast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It came as quite a shock to me that such a classic suburban mall could be built on undeveloped agricultural land and in the second decade of the 21st century, as we battle the high … costs of fossil fuel dependency,” he wrote on his blog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paton, Mr. Salmond and concerned Delta residents may fret all they want, however. There is nothing they can do about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TFN and its dynamic, 41-year-old Chief Kim Baird have powers other municipalities can only dream of. On their expanded native land base, deals can move ahead with the speed of a Sami Salo slap shot compared to the turtle dawdle that often slows municipal development plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With two major developers, the proposed, huge shopping mall was unveiled only last April. If approved, as expected, by TFN members in a vote Jan. 18, construction will begin later this year, with completion some time in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delta's controversial Southlands housing development, meanwhile, has been batted back and forth by critics and supporters for years. Yet another round of public consultation is set for the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No wonder developers clamour for TFN attention. The process isn't wide open. The TFN does do due diligence. But once a project gets the green light, it's full steam ahead, without a need to rezone, abide by municipal bylaws, and the like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Veteran Delta Mayor Lois Jackson says she doesn't begrudge her native neighbours the powers she and her council don't have. “They have a right to them,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, she wouldn't mind a bit of that same clout coming Delta's way. “We could always threaten to join Point Roberts, I guess.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thank you, busy little elves in the B.C. government's communications department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the rest of us indulged in laced eggnogs, squished figgy pudding and smashing any sound system blaring The Little Drummer Boy, they hunkered at their work benches to produce stockings full of press releases to remind us of government beneficence.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And on New Year's Eve, as Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga cavorted in Times Square, the spin-meisters in the dark halls of the legislature celebrated in their own quiet way with a press release extolling B.C.'s Open Data initiative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, New Year's Day. No sleeping in for the folks at the Ministry of Health. They woke disgustingly bright and early to provide a grateful, hung-over province with their “top 10 tips for a healthier you.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among them: “If you're at home with the kids, get active by doing jumping jacks, playing tag or dancing around the house.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if that wasn't enough to wean you from the Rose Bowl, there was also: “Pick a healthy recipe and get the whole family involved in learning how to make it.”</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's this kid, see, a clean-cut, nicely spoken young Canadian hockey player – loves his dog Sheeba, loves his parents and grandparents – and the hockey gods decide that one year to the very day that he was accused of choking, with a medal once again on the line, this tall, skinny goalie takes a 3-0 lead into the third period of his country's final game of the world junior hockey championship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can't you just see it? A year ago in Buffalo he has this same lead in the gold-medal game against Russia and is standing, shell-shocked, in net as the greatest meltdown in tournament history takes place around him – five consecutive Russian goals that stab this insecure hockey country straight to its puck-black heart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only sure thing this year in Calgary is that there's no border for his parents and grandparents to have to drive back across to get home, no Canadian border guard waiting to flick through their passports, dip down into the open window of the family car and say: “Oh crap, you're a Visentin!” as if it were some sort of curse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One year later, same day, same score with 20 minutes to go, and what happens? There's your plot and it's a winner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this case, it was: final score 4-0 Canada, with goaltender Mark Visentin granted a standing ovation as the player of the game. Mark Visentin with the shutout to give Canada the bronze medal over Finland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may not have been for the gold medal and it wasn't Russia, but it was personal redemption for a young man finally coming through the “toughest” year of his life. At only 19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Visentin had played a small part in this year's loss to the Russians, but the game was already 4-1 for the other side when he came in to replace Scott Wedgewood. The final 6-5 loss that ended Canada's gold-medal dreams could no more be blamed on him than on Wedgewood. It had, rather, been a full-squad failure to come together as a team until it was too late.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Against Finland for the bronze, there was no chance for a team championship but still a chance for individual triumphs. The young goaltender who had been criticized so viciously a year ago made his statement that this time it would be different in the opening period, stopping a clear breakaway by Markus Granlund, one of the most feared players in this tournament.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Visentin was not alone in seeking personal redemption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadians went up 1-0 on a lovely tip by Tanner Pearson on a perfect pass from Mark Scheifele. Scheifele, the Winnipeg Jets' top pick in 2011, and Pearson, a top prospect for the 2012 NHL entry draft, are best friends and linemates with the Barrie Colts (OHL) and had been considered scoring threats coming into the tournament. But it had not happened. The two had, until Thursday, been major disappointments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But all that was forgotten early.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the second period, following a strong save by Visentin, the puck flew down into the Finnish end, where it wound up on Pearson's stick behind the net. Pearson saw his linemate, fed him a perfect pass, and Scheifele ripped a wrist shot high past the blocker of Sami Aittokallio to make it 2-0. Quinton Howden finished off the Canadian scoring with two goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sensational story, however, was Visentin. He saved a penalty shot awarded to Teemu Pulkkinen. Then, he made The Save, a phenomenal catch in which the puck went off his shoulder, off the crossbar and was headed into the net when, somehow, Visentin swung around backward, catching it blind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Nice save,” Aittokallio said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Wow!” Canada's Freddie Hamilton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Flexible!” Pearson added, in awe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Amazing!” Canada's Brendan Gallagher said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final word, however, must go to Mark Visentin, the kid who a year ago drove back in the dark to the family home in little Waterdown, Ont., who had bravely taken full responsibility for the third-period meltdown – though it was far from his alone – and had realized that one day everything would be all right again when he saw old Sheeba, the golden retriever he had played street hockey with since the dog was a puppy and he a child, coming across the floor in a flurry of wiggles and wags.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One year later, to the very day, there was instead a standing ovation, a medal around his neck and, instead of everyone talking about him, everyone wanting to talk to him about that save.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jane Ellmann's pocket vineyard is still too muddy to prune back this week – she's waiting for a hard freeze to get in and do the last chore of the season. She and her husband Peter own Muse Winery on southern Vancouver Island, tucked up against a sheltered cove on the Saanich Peninsula. They grow grapes with alluring names like Ortega, Bacchus and Marechal Foch – varietals more often found growing in northern Germany and France.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Muse is a popular stop on Vancouver Island wine tours, but the wine is almost impossible to buy outside British Columbia. For all but the biggest of B.C.'s 200 wineries, the Rockies present a solid barrier to selling their products to other provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year the Ellmanns tried to work through the legal hurdles presented by the prohibition-era law, the Importation of Intoxicating Liquors Act, by sending their wines to Alberta's liquor commission for distribution. By the time the government was done, a bottle of their award-winning “Voluptuous Vixen” Foch Noir cost an extra $10. “After all that work, we didn't make any money,” Ms. Ellmann said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The B.C. Liberal government has offered tepid support to pull down the cross-border restrictions, but it has fallen to Adrian Dix, the leader of the B.C. New Democratic Party, to champion the interests of business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's just good common sense,” Mr. Dix said in an interview this week. “I don't know why the government isn't doing it. There is inertia in these things.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dix says it is worth taking a hit on provincial liquor revenues to allow the province's wineries to sell their products directly to Canadians outside B.C. Coming from a politician better known for wanting to raise business taxes to pay for social programs, it's a remarkably free-enterprise approach. He's earned kudos from Conservative MP Dan Albas, the Okanagan-Coquihalla MP who is pushing a private member's bill in Ottawa to change the federal law. Mr. Albas would give each province the right to set personal exemptions so that a Calgary oenophile could order a case of wine directly from an Okanagan vintner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current law is easily evaded by tourists who drive across the border. What B.C.'s winemakers really want is to free up online sales and make inroads into the lucrative Ontario market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Averill Creek winemaker Andy Johnston holds the current law in contempt. “It's a joke, a farce,” he said. In defiance, his Cowichan Valley vineyard will ship wine across the country by courier, but most of the 7,000 cases he produces each year are consumed in B.C. because distribution through other provincial liquor boards – Ontario in particular – is a nightmare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ottawa, Mr. Albas' proposed change has won support across party lines, but the provinces are lukewarm. “There is not one province that has indicated they think it's a great idea,” noted Miles Prodan, executive director of the B.C. Wine Institute. Ontario wants to protect its own wine industry, but all the provinces are concerned about loss of revenues if wineries can sidestep provincial liquor control boards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. Premier Christy Clark has applauded Mr. Albas' efforts, and has pledged to work with the other provinces to open new domestic markets to B.C. wines. But it is hard to see where Ms. Clark has taken action. There's no indication she raised it at any of her meetings with other premiers to date, and she is not expected to bring it up when she hosts the premiers for a conference later this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nirmal Gidda, proprietor of the Mt. Boucherie Family Estate Winery in Kelowna, can't figure out why the B.C. Liberals aren't all over this issue. He can measure the value of the wine tourism trade in the Okanagan by the Alberta licence plates that dominate his parking lot every summer. They can – and do – bring wine home with them, but being able to sell wine over the telephone or Internet would be a huge boon. “It would probably increase our revenues by 25 to 30 per cent to be able to ship to private customers in Alberta,” Mr. Gidda figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Okanagan – the province's prime wine region – has reliably returned B.C. Liberals to the legislature for two decades. Mr. Gidda's nearest vineyard neighbour is Quail's Gate, owned by B.C. Liberal MLA Ben Stewart. “And yet it's hard to get any commitment from them,” Mr. Gidda said. “We need to have somebody step up to the plate.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the B.C. Liberals' apparent stranglehold on the region, the NDP Leader senses an opportunity. Since winning the party leadership last spring, Mr. Dix has visited here 17 times. “They are taken for granted by the B.C. Liberals,” he said. “I'm not going to write the Okanagan off.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By pushing Ms. Clark's government on this issue, Mr. Dix is giving the grape trade someone to cheer for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">******</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE B.C. WINE INDUSTRY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the great pullout of 1988 – when the B.C. government paid wine growers to haul out their low-grade vines – the winemaking industry has become the province's chief agricultural success story. In 1990, a good hectare of vines went for as little as $5,000; today, a planted hectare goes for about $210,000. How the industry has changed:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Wineries in B.C. in 1990: 17</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Hectares of vineyards in 1990: 600</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Wineries in B.C. in 2011: 203</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Hectares of vineyards in 2011: 4,000</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Value of B.C. VQA wine sales in 2010/11: $195-million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Average price per 750 ml bottle: $17.49</p>

Five years ago her husband left her for one of her friends and she refuses to move past the victim role. She dwells on the past and spends most of her time away from work in bed, neglecting her three teenagers when they're in her care.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your friend's depressive state is not your responsibility. If you feel she is toxic to your life, spend less time with her, but when you are planning to get together, be positive, and stay that way. Her mood need not affect yours – don't let it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You may not realize this, but your being a casual work friend as opposed to the kind of soul sister who'd move in and start baking casseroles at the first sign of trouble, makes you particularly well-positioned to give your troubled lunch companion just the tonic she needs: a verbal smack upside the head.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next time you're having lunch and your friend commences wallowing in her pool of suffering, cut her off with these words: “It seems to me like you're having a lot of trouble getting past this. I really think you need to talk to a professional about it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She'll slow down only long enough to nod somberly at your words, then continue wallowing. Say again: “I really think you need to talk to a professional about it.” Repeat as needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the third or so repetition, she'll feel self-conscious. She'll realize you're not permitting her to wallow any deeper in her cozy, womb-like pool – every time she's about to dive down for those nuggets of betrayal and heartbreak, you yank her back to the surface. She'll feel a bit hurt, because “You need to talk to a professional” comes with a clear “You need to stop talking to me” subtext. But believe me, this is the biggest favour you can do for your friend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've all been where she has been, and we've all, eventually, arrived at that breaking point of self-disgust, noticing how fetid and murky the once warm, caressing waters of our suffering-pool have become – until at last we understand it's time to towel off and get on with our lives.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After 28 years of marriage, my wife told me a year ago she no longer loved me and wanted me to leave. After months of trying to get her into counselling (she suffers from intermittent explosive disorder), and tired of years of being assaulted and belittled in front of our three daughters, I finally left. I was a hard-working and loving husband, with no issues with substance abuse or anything that would provoke such outbursts. Now I am starting a new life in a new relationship. When I mentioned this to one of my daughters, I was accused of moving on too soon. All three of my daughters, who grew up witnessing my wife's treatment of me and have begun to emulate it, now refuse to speak to me. How can I find closure?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On second glance, it is even more difficult.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Al-Munzir Es-Sayyid is the 22-year-old son of Mahmoud Jaballah, suspected of being a member of Egyptian al-Jihad, an Al-Qaeda affiliate. The son came to Canada at age 7. The father went to jail for six years, beginning when the son was 12, but was not deported because of concerns that Egypt, under president Hosni Mubarak, would torture him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Es-Sayyid was one of six children raised by their mother on welfare. He earned no high school credits, was a chronic juvenile offender and got involved in armed robberies after age 18, involving handguns and sawed-off shotguns. He preyed on marginalized women working in massage parlours, believing they would not contact police, and was sentenced to 2½ years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian government argues, reasonably, that he is a present and future danger to Canada. He has no close friends, no job skills, and is a substance abuser. Even a brother, who owns a business, did not sign a letter promising to employ him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what is the humanitarian case? He was deprived of his father's influence in his formative years. “Since my dad has been incarcerated, I have not had a role model or a father figure.” A lawyer went even further, on his behalf, seeming to blame Canada for what the son became: “His behaviour, although unquestionably wrong, was also an understandable reaction to what he and his family had been put through. Cynicism and selfishness were not ingrained traits, but defence mechanisms.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leaving aside whether a suspected terrorist makes a good role model, Canada is not to blame for what Mr. Es-Sayyid made, or didn't make, of his life. The Federal Court of Canada was right to be unmoved by his plea for a humanitarian case against deportation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the dust settles in the new Egypt, Mr. Jaballah could some day be safely deported. The son could then have his role model.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's a New Year's resolution that will make a big difference in your enjoyment of life with your teen. It's this simple: I won't take what they say so personally.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a big problem when you have a teenager. They are nice some of the time, but some of the time they are irredeemably not nice. When you go against what they want, they have this unpleasant tendency to become really nasty. Their words hurt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I hate you.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I wish I had any other parent but you.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You're a psychotic neat freak.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That's so stupid.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem with words like the above is that they are not so easy to brush off. We take them personally. In response to the above, it is normal to feel that you must be doing something wrong, that they are accusing you of real flaws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the truth is that it's not personal. It is not about you at all, other than that you are the parent. Though unpleasant, the above nasty accusations do not mean what they seem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let me offer translations of some of these hurtful words. Their more accurate meaning is far less critical of you. Understanding this can not only help you avoid pain, it also can help you avoid making unhelpful responses that often trigger very unpleasant escalating battles with your teen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I hate you.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“How can you say that?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Because I mean it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But that's a terrible hurtful thing to say.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Well, I wouldn't say it if you weren't so mean to me.” Etc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are the translations:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I hate you.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Translation: “I'm really angry at you because I'm not getting my way – either you said ‘no' or you asked me to do something that I didn't feel like doing. But I don't hate you the rest of the time – especially when I am getting my way.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I wish I had any other parent but you.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Translation: “Actually this is a lie, because if the other parent was my parent but not you, they wouldn't think that I'm so special like you do. But I do wish I had a parent who said ‘yes' rather than the ‘no' that you just said.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You're a psychotic neat freak.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Translation: “Actually, I like the house being neat, but I have no intention of participating in the process of keeping it that way.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That's so stupid.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Translation: “I think I know something better than you do, which makes me feel good, because I'm not very confident about a lot of stuff in most of the rest of my life. Also, I feel safe being rude to you, because even if you don't like it, you're not going to kick me out.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If their words still deeply bother you, and you feel that you do want to respond, I would strongly advise not responding in the moment. That always and only pours fuel on the fire. Wait until a later neutral time and then deliver your message.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, if you want to have them never say these mean things to you, there's an easy solution – though I don't recommend it. Go along with everything they want.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the first of January, NDP MLA Jagrup Brar has been hosting near-daily news conferences to update the media on his pilgrimage to live a life of poverty – well, for a month anyway.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late last year, Mr. Brar was the lone MLA to accept a challenge that the anti-poverty group Raise-the-Rates put to all provincial legislators: Spend a month living on the $610 that a single employable person living on welfare in B.C. gets 12 times a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether Mr. Brar volunteered or lost a massive game of rock-paper-scissors in the NDP caucus, we'll never know. That said, it was certainly a shrewd decision to plan his much-hyped poverty reality show for January – a notoriously slow news month in which the carcass of anything that even resembles a potential story can be chewed over for days by reporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consequently, the news media have joined Mr. Brar for virtually every step of his journey – from the emotional goodbye to his family as he headed out the door to begin it all to his cheerless account this week of trying to find accommodations that he didn't have to share with an extended family of cockroaches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brar says he spilled tears imagining those who have to live their life in such spiritless and depressing surroundings. We'll have to take his word for it – about the tears, that is. Only six days into his adventure, Mr. Brar seems to have the media hooked – or at least on the hook to cover the story every step of the way. So to that extent, the stunt has worked brilliantly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I realize that may seem harsh, but, unfortunately, it is true. After a month “living on welfare,” Mr. Brar won't have a true understanding of what it's like to be poor and raising kids and having to go out and find a job in a jobless market. In a month's time, he'll go back to living in his beautiful home and the comfortable life that a salary in excess of $100,000 a year affords him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To hear Mr. Brar say, before he started his challenge, that he worried for his health was almost laughable. He is a big, fit-looking man who once played international basketball for India. Sure, he may drop a few pounds, which for most people after the holidays isn't a bad thing. There are people on January cleanses who will lose more weight than Mr. Brar does over the same period. He will never know what it's like to get near the end of the month with no money left and have to forgo food for the sake of kids who need it more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there is no one who knows that better than New Democrats themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 2004, Liberal MLA Lorne Mayencourt decided to spend a week living on the streets of Vancouver. The move was derided by NDP MLAs at the time as a shameless stunt by someone deciding to play “tourist” in the Downtown Eastside. The New Democrats quoted community activists who said a person couldn't appreciate a life of true poverty unless they'd experienced it for at least two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When B.C. Premier Christy Clark decided last spring to don a waitress's apron and serve coffee for a couple of hours in a bid to “walk in the shoes” of those making minimum wage, the ploy was universally derided. New Democrats damaged their eyes from rolling them so furiously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How is what Mr. Brar doing any different?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem with this entire exercise is that it's solely political. It is intended to do one thing only: embarrass the government. And I suppose people are invited to imagine how it will all be better if and when the NDP gets into power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'd have more respect for Mr. Brar if he eschewed crass political theatre and offered concrete solutions to a real public-policy dilemma. It's fine to say welfare rates are too low and the life they afford good, honest and decent people is immoral. But what will the New Democrats do? How will they change welfare policy in the province to make life easier for those on it? How much will they raise the rates? And where will the money come from?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if Mr. Brar pledged on behalf of his party to end the shameless policy introduced under the Liberals to claw back every dollar a welfare recipient makes while on the dole, it would be more valuable than pretending to be poor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brar should know that it's tough to quit poverty. Tough to fake it too.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been times in his coaching career when no teams killed penalties like Ron Wilson's.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's his 1997-98 Washington Capitals, co-holders, with the 1999-2000 Dallas Stars, of the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s single-season record with an 89.2-per-cent success rate. And in 2007-08, Wilson's <span class="companylink">San Jose Sharks</span> led the league at 85.8 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then consider that the Toronto Marlies have one of the best penalty-killing units in the American Hockey League, and the Toronto Maple Leafs' long walk in the short-handed desert under Wilson remains a mystery – last in the league at 73.4 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Leafs, who play the Detroit Red Wings at the Air Canada Centre on Saturday, had only one penalty in Thursday's 4-0 win over a Winnipeg Jets team that, as usual, floundered on the road. The Leafs killed off the penalty, as they killed off all five penalties in a 7-3 win over the Tampa Bay Lightning on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tampa, a team with high-end offensive talent, is dead last in the league on the power play on the road (seven goals in 82 opportunities, or 8.5 per cent) and fourth on the power play at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Honestly,” Lightning head coach Guy Boucher responded when asked what the Leafs' silver-lining brigade could take home from the penalty-kill shutout, “we wouldn't have scored if we were playing against four orange cones.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A false spring? The Red Wings will be more of a test.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto is a city of analysts, and if explanations for the Leafs' short-handed woes were compiled, they would boil down to some combination of too many minor penalties, fear of their own goaltender, a tendency to overreach for loose pucks in their own end while at the same time failing to challenge at the blueline. In general, there's a passivity that suddenly turns frenetic when the opposing team starts to squeeze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wilson said after Friday's practice that his team “bottomed out” in giving up two power-play goals in a 3-2 loss to the Jets on New Year's Eve. He credited regular penalty-killing minutes for Darryl Boyce and Joey Crabb for giving the unit more zest, joking about how “bubble players” will do anything to keep a job, including “sticking their head in front of a shot.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Leafs have had a fine collection of dead-enders in recent years, so you'd think the one area in which they'd be proficient would be a seat-of-the-pants penalty kill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the expected return of Mike Brown and Mike Komisarek to the lineup Saturday, coupled with Dion Phaneuf's uncertain status, could put the penalty kill in a state of flux. (X-rays revealed Phaneuf did not suffer a fracture after a shot hit the side of his face on Thursday, and he is expected to play Saturday after missing Friday's practice.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ken Hitchcock's Stars team in 1999-2000 shares the record for single-season penalty-killing efficiency with the Capitals that were coached by Wilson. Now head coach of the St. Louis Blues, Hitchcock said this week that weaknesses in penalty-killing units are among the most easily exposed items during video sessions, and that failing to address bad habits leads to a “sense of panic” in a game that is more than ever determined by special teams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Generally,” Hitchcock said, “the good penalty-killing teams beat you with their legs. You watch them and they're skating to position instead of just sort of gliding into position. Some people will say you kill penalties with your head. To me, it's always been the legs.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leafs defenceman Keith Aulie has split penalty-killing time with both the Marlies and the Leafs this season, and he shook his head when asked why one team has been so good and the other so bad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The structure's the same,” he said with a shrug. “It's really all a matter of confidence. With the Marlies, we'd go out on the PK thinking we were going to kill it off. One guy would pressure the other team, and all of a sudden we were all going at that team hard. When you are confident, you are comfortable. And when you are comfortable, you don't try to make plays that aren't there.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After 31/2 years of Wilson, there is no reason that this shouldn't be part of the Leafs' DNA. Along with being shut out from the playoffs, it's the most disturbing blot on his résumé.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dear Mike,</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What can I say, first The Nutcracker, and now a Rob Ford opera?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, Karen Kain didn't take any of my suggestions for the ballet – no wonder it didn't get extended past Christmas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I hope you'll be more receptive. Here we go:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talent</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You're casting someone to play me, so you need a big name – someone beloved by the people who have better things to do than take public transit. Is Pavarotti available? Just remember that even if his agent says no, you need to up your price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judging</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will Simon Cowell be a judge? Because I'm not sure that's a good idea. Sometimes you're sitting there watching The X Factor practically in tears over what you're seeing and hearing and then Simon Cowell says it sounded like cruise-ship karaoke. (Like that's even a bad thing…) I don't think he's right for this project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Job Cuts</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How many actors have you already cast? Because if you're like most downtown elites, you've hired too many incompetent workers and you're paying them too much money. I think you should offer early retirement to the entire cast (except Pavarotti). If they don't take it, then we should think about layoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Unions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another major cost centre is going to be labour, namely those union goons with IATSE. So here's my idea: Let's write an IATSE crew into the script. Then, for the climax of Act II, they get taken out by the Don Bosco football team. But here's the thing: The IATSE crew is played by an actual IATSE crew and they're taken out – MMA style – by actual Don Bosco football players.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheerleaders</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's get some. I've been watching some opera on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> and it's really hard to follow what's going on. If there were cheerleaders to cheer when a song ended, the audience would know when to start clapping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opera House</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's the plan: We sell those three theatres no one wants – the Sony Centre, the one across the street that does all those weird government funded plays, and the one Lastman built up in North York. Then we take that money – let's say $300 million – and add it to the budget surplus (which is going to be huge). And then, my friend, we build the world's first drive-in opera house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Picture in your mind the <span class="companylink">Disney</span> castle, just before a movie starts, when the fireworks go off and then that halo of sparkly fairy dust appears. Now picture the Luxor casino in Vegas, with that light on top that's visible from space. We need something BIGGER.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Music</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Have you actually listened to opera? It sucks. That stuff may have been popular a hundred years ago, when people wrote with feathers and everyone was worried about the plague. But not today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday I was driving home from City Hall and listening to the radio when The Power of Love, by Jennifer Rush (not the Celine Dion version), came on. There I was stuck behind a streetcar, angry as all heck, when suddenly I find myself belting out, “Because I am your lady…”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the kind of music people want to hear. So tune your dial to Boom 97, or CHFI – Toronto's Lite Favourites. And then write some incredible opera.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is going to be just amazing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sincerely,</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What on earth were we doing in Kandahar? Now that it's all over, that question hangs in the air. Decades hence, students will be stumped by that question in much the same way I was when my high-school textbook opened to Canada's place in the Boer War. It was full of sound and fury, but signifying what? How did we pour five years, more than $18-billion and 158 lives into something so large and nebulous? How do we avoid repeating the mistake?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The process that led from Canada's modest 2001 participation in the Kabul operation into the five-year semi-colonial Kandahar odyssey that began in 2006 remains something of a mystery. I've heard diplomatic and military officials of very high rank tell me they don't really know how Canada became embroiled. Al-Qaeda had already been banished from Afghanistan by the time we entered the south. Our soldiers were professional, extremely courageous, calmly civilized and never quite sure what had caused them to be there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We now have some surprising answers. Analysts with London's Royal United Services Institute, a security think tank, gained un-precedented access to the confidential documents and British official records of the decision by NATO members in 2003 and 2004 to expand the Afghan war. Matthew Willis analyzed the Canadian decision, which was deeply entwined with Britain's. His paper, to be released this month, describes a secret decision by senior Armed Forces officials, without the knowledge of NATO or likely of Canada's prime minister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Canadians and the British,” a senior NATO official told Mr. Willis, “hammered out the whole thing without NATO's assistance, behind closed doors. … We were not aware of the details.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Canada was ostensibly fighting with the 42-nation NATO International Stability and Assistance Force, the decision to establish a base in Kandahar, the most dangerous province, was negotiated in London without the knowledge – and against the advice – of the Brussels-based military alliance. NATO had been pressuring General Raymond Henault, then head of the Canadian Forces, to set up a mission in Chaghcharan or Herat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Canada's military officials had other ideas – and most were rooted in their experience in Bosnia, five years earlier. They had come to dislike “partnering with the Italians or certain other European nations,” Mr. Willis writes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The generals also felt that the Bosnia and Kosovo missions hadn't won Canada much international recognition. Those had been real coalitions, and Canada had blended into the background.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The reason went well beyond a Canadian desire to be patted on the back,” Mr. Willis writes, citing interviews with Canada's military leaders. “It was about being able to make one's voice heard in the political and military fora where mission-defining decisions were being taken, including, not least, plans for the use of Canadian soldiers. It was thus also about improving Canada's ability to exert its influence in accordance with its interests and values.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime minister Paul Martin must have known that Canada's troop commitment, just shy of 3,000, was the most it could muster, and may not have been enough for Kandahar. But the generals pressed ahead. Part of it, they told Mr. Willis, was a desire to please Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He raises the “contentious question why the senior Canadian military leadership, and the defence and foreign affairs departments, persisted in pushing the mission forward. Ostensibly, the military was seeking redemption after a decade of unremarkable performances in unremarkable (read: peacekeeping) theatres; or perhaps it wanted to show the U.S., the Canadian public and other key allies that it really could do combat if called on.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Implicit and sometimes explicit in all of the above,” he concludes, “is the idea that Canadian planners were pursuing a principally national agenda divorced from the NATO plan and heavily conditioned by beliefs about what would go over well in Washington.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is discomforting to think that this war was prolonged beyond the ouster of al-Qaeda in order to further interests of organizational pride and stature. But it was a big part of the decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This may well be the reality of modern war, as we saw in Libya, where a handful of countries forged an ad hoc alliance in confidential meetings far outside of NATO's vision and without all its members – a cafeteria NATO, if you will. It is a less formal process, but one whose miscalculations can cause years of damage.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Movie Central, 9 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This four-part adaptation of Michel Faber's bestselling novel about Victorian England is not your Masterpiece Theatre version of period drama. It tells the story of a prostitute named Sugar (Romola Garai) and her lengthy involvement with the married William Rackham (Chris O'Dowd), an affair that plunges the viewer into the seamy elements of the sex trade that flourished in the London of the era. No TV adaptation could be as pungent and explicit as the book, but this soft-core, sexed-up drama comes close. As one reviewer said of Sugar's charms, she is “skilled in the arts of flattery and fellatio.” Rackham's missus (Amanda Hale) is going nuts. Rackham pays to have exclusive access to Sugar, who despises them all. The tale is compellingly rife with the smell of corruption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two Greedy Italians</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TLN, Saturday, 9 p.m., Sunday,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's good to see TLN has picked up this charming BBC series – old pals and renowned chefs Antonio Carluccio and Gennaro Contaldo mosey around the Italy they left decades ago to dwell on what has changed in Italian culture and how that has affected the way Italians eat. Essentially, they eat their way through Italy and josh and banter as they go. Recipes and information are provided. The insights into contemporary Italy are less than striking but sometimes fascinating vignettes emerge. Apparently, at one point later in the series, “Gennaro is moved to tears by an unusual group of cheese makers.” Right on. Also take note that Desperate Housewives is back tonight (ABC, CTV, 9 p.m.), and a new Pan Am airs, before the series goes on hiatus (ABC, CTV, 10 p.m.).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Firm</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunday, Global, NBC, 9 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solid but uninspiring, this Canada/U.S. co-production is a TV sequel to John Grisham's 1991 novel and movie based on the book. In the two-hour premiere, we meet Mitch McDeere (Josh Lucas) and his wife, Abby (Molly Parker). Through flashbacks and slow revelations, we learn that the McDeere family has been in the witness-protection program because Mitch gave info to the FBI about organized crime. Now Mitch wants to be a do-gooder lawyer in a one-man office, helped by his investigator brother, Ray (Callum Keith Rennie), and office assistant, Tammy (Juliette Lewis). The backstory about mobsters out to get revenge on Mitch often erupts. The series errs seriously on the side of caution, plodding when it should have zest, but if old-fashioned legal drama is your bag, you'll love it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">on The Passionate Eye</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This fine, poignant documentary by Jeffrey Blitz (who made the Oscar-nominated Spellbound) looks at how winning the lottery changes the lives of average Americans, often for the worse. An exception is Quang and his wife, Mai, Vietnamese immigrants who worked in a Nebraska meat-packing plant and won $22-million (U.S.). Their generous spending on family makes them happy and relaxed. Others profiled, however, have been driven to near insanity by sudden wealth. Most startling is Buddy, a guy considered a hero after running into a burning building to save a boy's life who is then “rewarded” with a $16-million lottery win. The money evaporates. As one of Buddy's pals says, wisely, “Winning the lottery is like throwing Miracle-Gro on all your character defects.” There's also James, a suicidal loner who wins $5-million on a ticket bought with his last dollar, and really struggles to adapt. There is an awful lot of sadness here.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The British painter David Hockney has implicitly criticized his fellow artist Damien Hirst for using assistants to aid in creating his art, but his attack is unconvincing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hockney made his statement by way of a poster for an upcoming exhibition of landscapes at London's Royal Academy of Art. The poster boasts, “All the works here were made by the artist himself, personally.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pop art was built on appropriated mass culture images. Artists such as Andy Warhol and Peter Blake took everyday items, such as <span class="companylink">Campbell Soup</span> cans and similar ephemera, and incorporated them into their fine art. Pop artists also employed factory-like manufacturing techniques; hence, Warhol's Factory. Their challenge to the fine art establishment, by riffing off mass culture and mass production, had its share of critics in the late 1950s and early '60s, but pop art nevertheless became a prevalent form.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hockney himself has used machines, computers and even iPads to make art. These tools are used in the same way as paintbrushes to create. How different is it to have a machine or a hired assistant to help produce artwork? If the essence, and idea, were the artist's, the resulting work still belongs to its creator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Artists have worked with assistants for centuries, employing pupils to aid them in creating their masterpieces. Mr. Hirst, the most prominent of the Young British Artists, is known for his fascination with death through art. One of his most renowned pieces, which involves the corpse of a shark suspended in formaldehyde, was probably not a one-person job. But he is one of the heirs to the great pop artists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr Hockney is striking a pose as an old fogey. He recently quoted a Chinese proverb: “You need the eye, the hand and the heart. Two won't do.” Instead of echoing the early critics of pop art, he should stick to what he does best – his own art – and leave criticism to the critics.</p>

Snakes guard Buddha statues, ancient sites are reached on tiny dirt paths with no one around, street snacks [include] … cricket-on-a-stick.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, Burma was tricky travelling with its authoritarian government, but that eased last year, says Reid, when the country's National League for Democracy revised its tourism boycott to welcome “responsible tourism” after its leader Aung San Suu Kyi was released from house arrest. “The main discovery is simply the people,” says Reid, who also writes Reid on Travel (reidontravel.blogspot.com). “I've never found sweeter people anywhere.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lord Howe Island, Australia: Yes, you can go to Uluru and the Sydney Opera House, but tell your pals you spent your holiday on Lord Howe Island and you'll earn castaway credibility. Located a two-hour flight from Sydney in the South Pacific Ocean, the sparsely populated island is a UNESCO World Heritage site. “I only went there for the first time last month … and after five days of pure bliss, I was wondering why I'd never been before,” says travel writer Lara Dunston, who has been trotting the globe with her photographer husband for the past six years and writing about it on GranTourismo (grantourismotravels.com). “It's pristine, lush and green, the landscape is dramatic, and it boasts an abundance of rare birds, plant and marine life, and is encircled by a reef. So the most popular things to do are snorkelling, diving and hiking.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oman: “Qatar, Dubai and Abu Dhabi get much of the attention in the Persian Gulf, but Oman should be on everyone's radar,” says Gary Arndt, who writes the travel blog Everything, Everywhere (everything-everywhere.com). Oman, situated along the Arabian Sea, has an ambience that feels laid-back, less developed and more “traditional Arabia” too, says Arndt, who has visited more than 100 countries since he sold his house and shouldered a backpack almost five years ago. Where to find that sense of discovery in Oman – besides wandering among the souks, Portuguese forts and frankincense trees? Arndt says his highlight was exploring the fjords in the Musandam peninsula from a Land Rover. “It is one of the few places on Earth where mountains, desert and sea all come together.”</p>

Travel costs are minimal (once you reach your starting point), the scenery is up close and personal, and after burning all those calories, you can indulge in the local cuisine guilt-free. We stay in comfortable hotels/motels or guest houses. Because we have our bikes, we can venture out of the city centre to areas where accommodation is cheaper – no need to rent a car or hire a cab to get us where we need to go. – M.O.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">416-533-8377</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$80 for dinner for two with wine, tax and tipLiberty Village has not exactly been a hotbed of gastronomy. Which is strange when you consider that the local Metro is a supermarket clearly catering to foodies – you can buy a small box of raw oysters for a buck apiece, among other treats. It's condo city, and who's kidding, nobody's cooking up there. Maybe shucking an oyster or two, but for dinner people go out or order in. Which has me wondering about the schlock that's generally been dished in the neighbourhood. Some of it has gotten a reality check. Liberty Noodle recently went belly-up, and Atelier Thuet (another stinker) didn't last too long. Liberty Belle, which was actually decent, closed in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, finally, a restaurant worthy of the tastemakers in the area! Bar Vespa is that pleasant combo platter, a spot that both looks good and tastes good. It's in that splendid reclaimed industrial building at 167 East Liberty St., and the designers show off the double-height ceiling and old brick walls with panache. Three cheers for industrial chic: one dark-red wall, windows curtained in newsprint fabric, and Fat Albert light bulbs interspersed with crystal drop chandeliers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The menu is a bit of a minefield. A diner will have to step carefully to avoid the bar food that litters the “small plates” portion of the menu. Perhaps this is Vespa's nod to the unfortunate food traditions of Liberty Village: Suppli are flavour-free deep-fried risotto balls. Spicy tomato sauce helps … a bit. Chorizo fonduta is like the worst cheese fondue you ever ate – a gummy coral-coloured slurry with almost no taste. It reminds me of the Shrimp Newburg I made at age 13. (Chief ingredients: béchamel sauce and ketchup. We all have to start somewhere.) Lamb spaducci is badly overcooked lamb with the taste of the grill on it. Fried squid have no salt and are not crisp, and their accompanying polenta batons are greasy. The only “people food” on that part of the menu is the wedding soup, a pleasant stracciatella with okay meatballs in it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe they made the appetizers so nasty because they think Liberty Village people want bar food? Is it a thing that if you live in a condo south of King and west of Ossington you like empty carbs garnished with grease?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it's a marketing ploy, they need a new one. What they don't need, however, is a new chef, because the main courses are all quite fine. Pizza is properly thin-crusted and crunchy, with a strong collection of traditional garnishes and just enough iconoclasm, in the form of a trio of white pizzas: potato, gorgonzola and mushroom. I personally favour white pizza because I find that the absence of tomato sauce gives more room to the savour of the crust, and removes any potential sogginess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pizza's alter ego, panini, is also beautifully done at Vespa. They use lovely, crisp Fred's Bread buns, and ingredients such as perfectly fresh buffalo mozzarella with tomato, basil and balsamic. Panini come with great sweet frites. The third member of Italy's great farinaceous trio, pasta, is handled with respect as well. Their trademark spicy tomato sauce does good things for nicely cooked shrimp, calamari and mussels on al dente linguine, and butternut squash ravioli are properly sweet, their pasta pockets impeccable, and who doesn't love the way fried fresh sage leaves contrast with the sweetness of the squash?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vespa's chicken dish is fun and easy-going: Breast of chicken has been lightly breaded and slathered in tomato sauce with melted fresh mozzarella swirled into it. What could be wrong with that? Not much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Funny how Vespa excels in the middle but drops the ball at the front – and back – ends. For dessert there is store-bought ice cream and house-made tiramisu. The server says they had panna cotta for a while, but “it didn't go over so well.” So try something else! The tiramisu is a sophomoric combo of espresso-soaked store-bought cake with something creamy that lacks both mascarpone and body. It feels like an afterthought, which is beneath the standards of Vespa's kitchen. The first good restaurant in Liberty Village can do better than a badly executed cliché for dessert.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's a sampling of recent news from around the world that you may have missed.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Egypt, tens of thousands of Coptic Christians – who make up 10 per cent of the population – have fled the country. The so-called Arab Spring has not been good news for them. In October, 27 people died when security forces opened fire on a crowd of peaceful demonstrators who had gathered to protest against church burnings. And last week, a teenaged Coptic boy was arrested for posting pictures of the Prophet Mohammed on his <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page. “Copts worry that even mainstream Muslims don't really care that much about the defence of Coptic rights,” says Paul Sedra, associate professor of history at Simon Fraser University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Bangalore, India, 200 activists from a right-wing Hindu group invaded a Christian church during Sunday prayers, and attacked the pastor for allegedly trying to convert Hindus to Christianity by offering them bribes. “We were informed by a family member of one of the Hindu men taking baptism that he was asked to convert to Christianity as he loved a Christian girl,” one activist told a reporter. “We immediately rushed to the church and stopped the conversion process.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Pakistan, Asia Bibi, a Christian mother sentenced to death for blasphemy, is doing “well,” according to her husband. She was sentenced after drinking water from a well reserved for Muslims, and for allegedly making derogatory remarks about Mohammed. Rights groups have reported that she is so frail she can barely stand. Shahbaz Bhatti, a Christian cabinet minister who tried to defend her, was assassinated last March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Nigeria, a violent pseudo-Islamic sect called Boko Haram is thought to be behind a series of deadly church bombings, including one on Christmas Day. Christian-Muslim tensions are on the rise, and Christians have also massacred Muslims. In Uganda, on Christmas Eve, Islamic extremists threw acid on a church leader and partly blinded him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, the country's leading bishop warned that Muslim fundamentalists are attacking Christians with impunity. Mobs have burned and ransacked churches, and rights groups say violence against religious minorities has escalated. This week, according to The Jakarta Globe, a hard-line Muslim group attacked church members over a bumper sticker saying, “We need a friendly Islam, not an angry Islam.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Iraq, two-thirds of the pre-war Christian population has fled the country. Some experts predict that Christianity in that country, as well as in the lands where Jesus walked, will soon be extinct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You get the picture. Religious strife is on the rise, and religious persecution is a serious problem in some of the world's biggest countries. Say what you like about the Harper government's plan to launch an Office of Religious Freedom as part of its foreign policy. You can say that it's naive, or dumb, or a blatant effort to appeal to the domestic religious base. But you can't say the issue doesn't matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., scholars across the political spectrum are trying to persuade the Obama administration to give the issue much higher priority. Among them is Thomas Farr, director of the Religious Freedom Project at the Berkley Center in the U.S. On his blog, he's argued that people “who think this idea is a fantasy of the Christian right, or that it represents illicit American exceptionalism, or cultural imperialism” fail to understand the connection between religious freedom and fundamental issues of justice and human dignity. Where religion still matters, promoting religious freedom is one of the most important ways to promote human freedom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life released a sobering look at the decline of religious freedoms around the world. It found that between 2006 and 2009, restrictions on religious beliefs and practices rose in 23 countries. Because some of these countries are so populous, the increases affected a much larger share of peoples and states. “More than 2.2 billion people – nearly a third of the world total population – live in countries where either government restrictions on religion or social hostilities involving religion rose substantially.” Governments in 101 countries used some measure of force against religious individuals or groups, “including individuals being killed, physically abused, imprisoned, detained or displaced from their homes, as well as damage to or destruction of personal or religious properties.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many in the secular West like to think that religion is playing less of a role in world affairs. They couldn't be more wrong. As religion scholar Philip Jenkins warns, religious conflict and issues of minority rights will play a major role in world affairs for years to come. “The most disturbing features of contemporary Christian/Muslim conflict is how very commonplace they have become,” he writes. “The blood-shed in Nigeria and Indonesia does receive some coverage in the West, yet violence of this sort has become almost too widespread to report.” Ex-panding Christian minorities are likely to provoke violent reactions from Muslims and others who feel threatened, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're interested in the forces that will shape the geopolitics of this century, a serious study of religion is a good place to start. We need to know much more about religion and society, not less.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the commercials in a new campaign to counter childhood obesity in Georgia shows a boy sitting on a folding chair, who says quietly, “Mom, why am I fat?” I was hoping his mom, sitting across from him, might say, “Well, son, let's talk about how Congress thinks that the tomato sauce on pizza qualifies as a vegetable in school meals …” but she didn't. She bowed her head in silent shame.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contentious campaign, called Strong4Life, features a parade of sad-faced, overweight children wondering how they ended up this way. The ads are directed at the kids, and not at the advertisers who push ChoccyMallow Breakfast Surprise, or the restaurant chains that hand them a plate the size of an elephant's foot and invite them to pile it high for less than the cost of a cauliflower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My favourite ad – and I say “favourite” in the same way that I have a favourite Friday the 13th movie – is the one featuring a grim girl, her arms folded above the slogan: “It's Hard to Be a Little Girl if You're Not.” Why not go all the way, I thought, and borrow the slogan that the manufacturers of RyKrisp used to prey on women's insecurities in the 1950s: “Nobody Loves a Fat Girl!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fat girl volcano is this way, ladies, if you'd like to follow me, and toss yourselves in. The line is long, and stretches through the centuries. I know this thanks to a new book, Louise Foxcroft's Calories &amp; Corsets: A History of Dieting Over 2,000 Years, which reveals that our obsession with slimness, and our demonization of fat, has an impressive history. There is no better time to read it than in this month of wretched self-loathing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As long as people have looked down at their muffin tops (or their suet crusts) and winced, slimming gurus have lined up to profit from the shame. The first diet bestseller was published in the 15th century, writes Ms. Foxcroft, a British historian of medicine. Three centuries later, the noted gourmet Brillat-Savarin was an early proponent of the low-carb diet, a bit like a Reign of Terror Dr. Atkins. Lose weight, he advised, or “become ugly, and thick, and asthmatic, and finally die in your own melted grease: I shall be there to watch it.” I doubt Weight Watchers will be adopting that slogan any time soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dieting, over the years, has been sold as a moral imperative, a patriotic duty, a Christian obligation. In the mid-20th century you could turn to Pray Your Weight Away or Devotions for Dieters, which included this desperate plea to the Almighty to save a sinner from pie: “I promise not to sit and stuff/But stop when I have had enough. Amen.” It wasn't just that you hated your chunky thighs; God was repulsed, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Foxcroft is very canny about the way health concerns are used to disguise what is essentially an aesthetic distaste for chubbiness. Fat has long been seen as a moral and intellectual failing: “The stupid, heavy, non-intellectual person, or the idiot, is generally fat and flabby,” wrote one 19th-century English doctor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not much has changed, even if we now put pillows around our language to guard against offence. “No one wants to be fat,” Tara Parker-Pope wrote recently in a fascinating and much-discussed article in The <span class="companylink">New York Times Magazine</span>. “In most modern cultures, to be fat … is to be perceived as weak-willed and lazy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the centre of her piece, The Fat Trap, is a paradox: Dieters, including Ms. Parker-Pope, actually work incredibly hard at losing weight. I doubt the physicists at CERN pay as much attention to numbers as the successful dieters she interviews, who weigh every gram of food that goes into their mouths and calculate every calorie burned on their bikes. But maintaining your new slim figure, as science shows, is very difficult and most people regain their spare tires, unless they're willing to devote every waking moment to banishing thoughts of doughnuts. Losing weight, which is supposed to liberate, instead becomes a prison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In America alone, the diet industry is worth $40-billion, slightly more than the GDP of Costa Rica. Every person who fails at a diet and embarks on another fattens the pocket of whoever is selling some chimerical notion of beauty. To what end, you have to wonder. For centuries, people in the West have been trying to lose weight – not for reasons of health, but for reasons of status – and it's a losing battle. Maybe it's time to refashion the RyKrisp slogan, and spell it out in chocolate chips: “Nobody loves a fat girl … except herself.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Rick Santorum began his improbable presidential run last June, half of Republican voters had never heard of him. Even after a dozen debates, he was just as unknown.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One group has long been well acquainted with him, however. And it is not the social conservatives behind his stunning tie for first place in this week's Iowa caucuses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gay rights activists have considered Mr. Santorum a menace since his 2003 outburst against a Supreme Court decision striking down anti-sodomy laws. They have ensured that, even after he lost his Senate seat in 2006, Mr. Santorum's name has lived on in infamy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus was born the noun “santorum” – a word whose definition is so unsavoury the ex-senator has been trying to get <span class="companylink">Google</span> to remove it from its search engine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as Mr. Santorum comes under scrutiny as potentially the only candidate able to stop Mitt Romney, he is discovering there is no erasing one's past in politics or cyberspace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sudden attention could take him down or rehabilitate the meaning of his name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Republican base still craves a candidate who can beat the “Massachusetts moderate” – as the fast fading Newt Gingrich calls Mr. Romney. Mr. Santorum may be poised to ride a conservative wave, if not to the nomination, perhaps to a place on the GOP ticket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As unlikely as that seems, it did not stop Carl Toepel, 72, from braving the nippy temperature to hold up a sign reading “Romney/Santorum” at a rally for the ex-senator here on Friday. The overflow crowd forced organizers to move the event outside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is like a Fellini movie,” Mr. Santorum, a boyish 53, quipped as he surveyed the crush of fans, hecklers and reporters before him in the parking lot of a local banquet hall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As recently as a couple of weeks ago, Mr. Santorum would probably have found it hard to lure more than a dozen or so supporters to an event here. Suddenly, he's a draw.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was telling people about him a long time ago,” crowed Sue Phillips, 80, as she waited for Mr. Santorum. “I do believe he could take it to Obama, tell him what's what.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Santorum is unlikely to give Mr. Romney much trouble in New Hampshire, where evangelical Christians will account for, at best, one-fifth of voters in Tuesday's GOP primary. But a top-three finish in the Granite State would confirm his momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bigger test will come on Jan. 21 in South Carolina. Evangelicals make up more than half of GOP primary voters there and two polls on Friday showed Mr. Santorum surging into second behind Mr. Romney in the Palmetto State. He may peak at just the right time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then again, he started out as a footnote in the GOP race and could still end up there as his rivals step up their attacks and the news media shine the spotlight his controversial career in the Senate, where he displayed a penchant for inflammatory metaphors and crass cultural warfare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The son of an Italian immigrant who grew up a staunch Catholic in Pennsylvania coal country, Mr. Santorum became an anti-abortion crusader after the stillbirth of a son in 1990.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is no exaggeration to say that strengthening the family is the cornerstone of his economic platform. He draws a direct link between the breakdown of the traditional family and spiralling government debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Governments get bigger,” he argues, “when families get weaker.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, he wrote It Takes a Family, which served as his rebuttal to Hillary Clinton's It Takes a Village, her 1996 book on the importance of non-family members on children's welfare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is his relentless antipathy toward gay rights that truly makes him stand out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He is not just someone who is opposed to equality,” said Michael Cole-Schwartz, a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign. “He has made it his life's work.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking to college students here on Thursday, he baited a questioner who argued that the right to happiness was enough of a justification to make gay marriage legal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you're not happy unless you're married to five other people, is that okay too?” Mr. Santorum shot back amid boos from the audience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His take-no-prisoners approach reassures social conservatives, who consider Mr. Romney wishy-washy on the issues important to them. They have no such doubts about Mr. Santorum, who, with his wife, Karen, home-schools their seven children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the focus shifts to Mr. Santorum's career in the Senate, where he was a top beneficiary of donations from lobbyists and earned a reputation for pork-barrel politics, he will face a hard time winning over Tea Party Republicans and fiscal conservatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revelation that he earned lucrative director and consulting fees after leaving the Senate from companies that were major donors when he was in office will not help his campaign, either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His rivals for the nomination are likely preparing attack ads with all the gory details.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Santorum has already accomplished more than he could have hoped for at the outset of his presidential bid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, at least, everybody knows his name.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Toronto Maple Leafs demoted their toughest fighter, Colton Orr, to the minor leagues this week, it was great news for hockey: Players who can only fight, not play, are on their way out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the world according to Brian Burke, the Leafs' outspoken general manager, it was a sad day. It's the Colton Orrs, he said, who hold the “rats” accountable for “cheap shots” – elbows to the head, hits from behind into the boards. Without Mr. Orr and his fearsome ilk on patrol, the job is left to the National Hockey League's official disciplinarian, Brendan Shanahan. So lacking are the “rats” in fear of on-ice retribution, says Mr. Burke, that a lineup of wrongdoers has formed outside Mr. Shanahan's door to await punishment.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burke, with a few spicy words, expressed the inverted logic shared by many of the NHL's executives, players and hockey-panel toadies: Fighters keep the game safe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is something he didn't mention: Colton Orr suffered a serious concussion last season, smashing his head on the ice in a fight with 230-pound George Parros. Medical imaging tests revealed brain trauma. In an earlier fight last season, he suffered an apparent concussion and did not miss a single game. Who keeps the game safe for Colton Orr?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is morally bankrupt to ask Colton Orr ever to fight again. After 99 NHL fights, he is at heightened risk of lifelong brain damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dirty play is not new. When Mr. Burke was the league's disciplinarian some years ago, stick-swinging was a big problem. In the Colton Orr era, deliberate head shots were often delivered in the presence of fighters. Is Mr. Burke saying those who do such things should be left in the game so they can be beaten up?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accountability should rest with the league, not with Colton Orr. The league, not Colton Orr, got rid of stick-swinging. The league, not Colton Orr, purged other evils – high-sticks to the face, slashes that broke forearms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shanahan and the league need to rise to the occasion – in Mr. Burke's lexicon, to show some character. What about a 10-game ban for a first deliberate head-shot offence, 40 for a second, a season for a third? Isn't that more accountability than a punch from Colton Orr?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hockey should not ask Colton Orr to pay the price – in head shots, and brain damage – of ridding the game of head shots, and brain damage.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Punctuationitis. It's the dizzying condition that afflicts anyone looking at a list of the highest-grossing films of 2011 in the United States and Canada. (It's also known as the sequel to Sequelitis.) It's what happens when the movie theatres are riddled with multipart series, remakes and franchise reboots, necessitating title punctuation that would have confounded Strunk and White.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top seven films at the domestic box office in the year just ended, in ascending order, are Cars 2; Fast Five; Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides; The Hangover Part II; The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1; Transformers: Dark of the Moon; and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, the champ with a $381-million (U.S.) gross.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or, in other words: a sequel that uses a numeral; a quintquel that spells out its number in its title; a quadquel that omits all numbers but employs a colon; a sequel denoted by a Roman numeral; a triquel that's the first part of an adaptation of book three in a trio; a quadquel that opts only for a colon; and the seventh film from the sixth novel of a series that, until the final book was split into two movies, eschewed all numerals, numbers and punctuation marks in favour of a conjunction (i.e., Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, et al.).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are you still with me? I hope so, because the craziness doesn't end there. Scrolling down the list to No. 14, we find X-Men: First Class, a prequel to a comic book film trio that uses both a hyphen and a colon; and, at No. 18, the finger-cramping Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, employing a dash, a colon and no number, though it is the fourth in a franchise, and a reboot of a TV series.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there's the rash of parentheses, which can indicate a re-release, as in The Lion King (in 3-D), No. 32 on the 2011 list; or an English-language remake, as in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011), No. 51; or a reboot of an earlier film, as in both Footloose (2011) and Drive (2011), Nos. 61 and 91.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I can only imagine the marketing department meetings, thick with copy editors and grammarians fighting valiantly to parse their titles. Did someone get fired for deciding to spell out Happy Feet Two, which only hit No. 50 on the list? Super 8 managed to come in at No. 20, despite the fact that it wasn't a sequel – though I'm sure some ticket buyers stayed away because they thought they'd missed Super's 1 through 7. And what will they call the sequel? Super 9? Super 8.2? Ditto for I Am Number Four at No. 56 – where were I Am's One through Three? Maybe 50/50 climbed only to no. 90 because audiences were scratching their heads about the other 49.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seriously, though, what are we to make of 2011's box office hits? Rounding out the top 10 were two comic book movies (Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger) and a series reboot (Rise of the Planet of the Apes). Clearly, all three are expecting to be back, with more numerals in their titles and more dollars in their coffers. Only at Nos. 11 (The Help) and 12 (Bridesmaids) did original films surface, and they had to share the rest of the top 20 with five more sequels, including Kung Fu Panda 2 (numeral; no punctuation) and Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (colon but no number).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, all year long, those of us whose ears are attuned to this particular frequency have heard nothing but an extended wail out of Hollywood – because, despite the fact that the top 100 films earned a combined total of about $8.5-billion (U.S.), the box office was consistently down this year compared to previous years, weekend per weekend and title per title. Audiences were buying the numerals and colons, but not as much as we used to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then this week, the Producers Guild of America – the individuals who actually make all these movies – released their 10 nominees for best picture. As usual, the Artful and the Profitable did not often intersect. The PGA announced its list in alphabetical order, but arranged by their 2011 grosses, they are The Help (no. 11), Bridesmaids (no. 12), Moneyball (no. 42 – note the steep drop there), The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (no. 51), Midnight in Paris (no. 54), Hugo (no. 63), War Horse (no. 67), The Ides of March (no. 72), The Descendants (no. 73), and – what many consider to be the Oscar front-runner – The Artist, tiptoeing in at no. 146.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, anyone rational would look at those two lists and wonder, why aren't more “good” movies profitable? Why aren't more profitable movies good? And hey, hmm, why isn't there a single number, numeral or colon on that nominee list?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps if Hollywood were serious about climbing out of its alleged slump, and giving audiences different and better choices that would in turn goose the box office, they would try to release more original pictures, movies like nos. 11, 12, and even 42 and 67, that can earn both money and acclaim. Look at Woody Allen's example – No. 54 is his highest-grossing movie ever, in a career that spans six decades, with, I might add, not a sequel in the bunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what are Hollywood's producers planning to give us in 2012? Why, more tortured punctuation, natch. More colons (Underworld: Awakening; Ice Age: Continental Drift; Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days). More numerals (Scary Movie 5 and Resident Evil 5; Step Up 4; Madagascar 3 and Men in Black 3 in 3D; Taken 2 and Expendables 2). More reboots of franchises already swimming in sequels (The Amazing Spider-Man; The Dark Knight Rises; The Bourne Legacy; The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3D; Halloween 3D). More films based on TV shows – 21 Jump Street; Dark Shadows; The Avengers (2012) – and toys (G.I. Joe: Retaliation; Battleship). More comic books (Wrath of the Titans) and 3-D reissues (Titanic 3D; Star Wars Episode 1 in 3D; Finding Nemo 3D).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, rather than recalling the problems behind the slump, we'll get prodded to see Total Recall (2012). Rather than a new dawn, we'll line up for Red Dawn (2012) and The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2. Rather than demand to go somewhere fresh, we'll take The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. And will it make us happy, to see Les Misérables (2012)? Or will we continue to be The 3 Stooges?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's up to us to vote with our wallets. The movies we get we deserve.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Did many people break up (cry) when they heard that singer Katy Perry and actor Russell Brand had broken up (separated)? More to the point, how could Brand file for divorce when, etymologically, the two performers were destined to be together?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perry, derived in the 1300s by way of French from the classical Latin pirum (pear), is a cider-like drink made from the juice of pears. Russelet, a noun that entered English in the 1600s from the French rousselet, refers to any variety of pear with a russet (reddish-brown) skin. How could two pears not be one pair?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It might be argued that although the performers' names are grounded in food, they are from two different worlds. Brandade, imported from French in the early 1800s, derives from the modern Provençal word brandado (“thing which has been moved or shaken,” according to the Shorter Oxford Dictionary) and means a Provençal dish made from salt cod. That's earthy food. By contrast, cate (pronounced “kate”) referred in the 1400s to “a choice article of food; a dainty, a delicacy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, if any couple were to burn its bridges, it makes sense that one of them would be named Brand. The original meaning of brand in Old English was destruction by fire, the source of the modern noun firebrand. (“Until I saw the profile of Katy Perry on CBS Sunday Morning,” an article in Florida's Orlando Sentinel said on Oct. 1, 2010, “I knew little about her except that she sang the infectious California Gurls and that she is engaged to firebrand Russell Brand.”)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should anyone wish to offer a consoling bouquet to the distraught Perry, the appropriate choice is African gardenias, known by the Afrikaans name katjiepiering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The week's news brought other verbal serendipity. The federal government will create an official bureau to condemn the religious persecution of people abroad. According to the article by The Globe's Steven Chase, the Conservatives “will finally flesh out a campaign promise to install the Office of Religious Freedom within the secular confines of the Department of Foreign Affairs.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While others debate the wisdom of this move, Word Play's interest is in the origin of “office.” It entered medieval English around 1300 from Old French, which borrowed it from the Latin officium, performance of a task, from the elements opus (work) and facere (do). And, says the Oxford English Dictionary, its first English sense was “an authorized form of divine service or worship.” By inaugurating an Office of Religious Freedom, the Harper Conservatives will be going medieval on their assailants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere in Wordland, reader Robert Burn writes: “I am looking for a Canadian riff on the British expression ‘might as well fan it with a kipper,' for an utterly futile intervention. Suggestions?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The closest I can come is the old line about locking the barn door after the horse has bolted, or various expressions that use a blow with a wet noodle as a metaphor for ineffectual. David Crystal's book As They Say in Zanzibar offers a few international candidates that might stock the pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Ireland: “It is no use throwing water on a dead rat.” From Japan: “It is no use applying eye medicine from a two-storey window.” From China: “You won't help shoots grow by pulling them up higher.” From India: “It is in vain to look for yesterday's fish in the house of the otter.” (That would include kippers.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the earlier barn-door quotation is international. From Britain, Crystal offers: “It's no good locking the stable door after the horse is stolen.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the horse were stollen (from the German for a rich fruit loaf), it would count as “a dainty, a delicacy,” and if it bore a brand, we'd be right back where we started with Katy and Russell.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitt Romney, the Tin Man of the Republican Party, will be its nominee for president, for no other reason than the collection of misfits, egotists, ideologues and second-raters against him.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as the one-eyed man is king in the land of the blind, so Mr. Romney is the best of a bad Republican lot. You doubt that description? Then just imagine Ron Paul, the 76-year-old favouring a return to the gold standard, abolition of the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> and five federal departments, and the return of U.S. troops from overseas everywhere. That he finished third in the Iowa caucuses proves that, when economic quackery meets foreign-policy delusion, good things can happen inside the Republican Party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or Rick Santorum, who couldn't defend his Senate seat in Pennsylvania, a strict constructionist and social conservative with zero appeal outside that hardy minority. Or let's not forget – although Republicans quickly did when they thought about it – Newt Gingrich, who couldn't open his mouth without insulting someone, reminding voters of his unfitness for high office. The more Iowans heard from Newt, the less they thought of him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were also, of course, Michele Bachmann (who departed the race after being humiliated in Iowa) and the comic figure of Rick Perry, the lantern-jawed cliché machine from Texas who, like Mr. Gingrich, saw an inverse relationship between his appearances and his popularity. Mr. Perry, lost in his own delusions, intends to carry on his hopeless cause until he runs out of cash, which will happen before he runs out of ego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, faute de mieux, there stood Mitt Romney, an eight-vote winner in Iowa but assured of victory in Tuesday's primary in New Hampshire, a state adjacent to Massachusetts, where Mr. Romney was once a moderate Republican governor. Unpleasantness lies ahead in South Carolina, a state where the blackest of political arts play themselves out, and perhaps in Florida. Thereafter, Mr. Romney should be in friendlier states, with no serious opponents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Being a Republican in Massachusetts required Mr. Romney to govern as a moderate conservative, in the tradition of Paul Cellucci or William Weld. Mr. Romney stepped into that mould and filled it well, designing, among other accomplishments, a health plan that was a template for the one crafted by President Barack Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, now that Mr. Romney is running for the Republican nomination – which means appealing to the party's hard core – he has disavowed his health-care creation. Likewise, he has reversed or amended other moderate positions that worked in Massachusetts but riled up red-meat conservatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About being a Mormon, there's nothing he can do. That might be a problem in parts of the country where evangelical Christians see Mormonism as a freakish religion contesting Christian beliefs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Romney has oodles of money – from contributors and from his own pocket, having earned piles as a takeover artist at <span class="companylink">Bain Capital</span>. His strongest pitch must be that he knows how to run big things, such as that company, Massachusetts and the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics. These are significant accomplishments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Were Republicans looking for administrative competence, packaged with can-do rhetoric, these successes would count for more than they apparently do. Instead, many Republicans are looking for inspiration around issues that get them fired up – “family values,” social conservatism, God-fearing practices, the smallest government possible but with a mighty military, yet lower taxes, a finger-in-the-eye attitude toward countries that disagree with the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Romney struggles to convert them, but, like the Tin Man, he just can't convince them that, inside that handsome package, his heart and theirs really do beat in tandem. They fear (not without reason) that, to win the presidency, he would tack and trim, dilute party principles and become a centrist political apostate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year was a very good year for celebrity divorce; by which I mean that it was a bad year for celebrity marriage. Of course I use the term “bad” only in the loosest moral sense, since it suggests the point of celebrity marriage is to stay together – and in case you haven't guessed, this is not a notion I cleave to.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor, in my opinion, should you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In our era, when the definition of legal partnership is being re-evaluated across the democratic world, it seems only right that we should embrace a more pluralistic concept of marriage. In the endless preamble to the U.S. election campaign, the sanctity of marriage has emerged as a hot-button issue – and no wonder, it's less confusing than the economy, less depressing than the environment and evokes vague notions of sex. I understand this debate is primarily focused on the distinction between heterosexual and homosexual marriage, but I propose the agenda be shifted away from wedding-mad gays to wedding-mad celebrities. Surely when it comes to the U.S. divorce rate (one of the highest in the Western world at around 40 per cent), couples such as Katy Perry and Russell Brand have more to answer for than, say, Glen Jones and Randy Smith from Illinois. Having said that, is it fair to blame celebrities for behaving exactly the way we have come to expect them to?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wouldn't bring this up if things didn't seem to be getting worse (or better, depending on your point of view). In 2011, we witnessed a veritable multi-car pileup of celebrity marital strife. It was a year that began with the relatively predictable snapping of the bond between Ryan Reynolds and Scarlett Johansson (“I gotta say, I'm a different person than I was six months ago,” Reynolds remarked philosophically of the split) and ended with a bust-up glut that had the Hollywood tabloid media hyperventilating with malicious glee. Within just a couple of months, we saw the dissolution of Ashton and Demi; the meltdown of J. Lo and Marc Anthony; Mel Gibson handing over half his $850-million (U.S.) fortune to his presumably-more-than-deserving ex-wife, Robyn; Maria Shriver ditching Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Kim Kardashian duking it out with Sinead O'Connor for the record of Shortest Celebrity Marriage of 2011 at 10 weeks and 17 days respectively (more on this later). (Incidentally, the Hollywood quickie marriage record-holder is Rudolph Valentino who, in 1919, had a six-hour union with the American actress Jean Acker. One can only imagine the degree to which this bit of trivia must irritate the recently re-engaged Britney Spears (a distant second at 55 hours), but give her time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the blasé manner in which celebrities like Kardashian and O'Connor (both clearly unhinged in wildly different ways) treat the idea of lifelong commitment, it seems obvious a different set of standards should apply to celebrity marriage. The reality-TV star Kardashian was hit with a tidal wave of public blowback following her decision to abandon her basketball-star husband just a few weeks after their “fairy-tale” wedding. But how is it in any way fair for the public to hold Kardashian up to normal standards of human behaviour? She has a job to do, and that job entails living a life that commands lots of publicity – good and bad, and primarily body-focused. How does moving to Minnesota and becoming a happily married wife and mother fit into that picture? It doesn't! Ergo, by marrying and divorcing Humphries in short order, Kardashian was simply fulfilling her duty as a reality star. As a divorcée, she is nothing if not a consummate professional.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now O'Connor's situation, on the other hand, is more complicated. The Irish pop singer had already had three marriages when she decided to wed Dublin therapist Barry Herridge in a drive-through ceremony in Las Vegas in December. According to a statement on her website, the wedding was “kiboshed within hours.” But wait! O'Connor has just reported via Twitter that she and her hubby have reconciled in “a mad, lovemaking affair,” which culminated in their deciding to “be boyfriend and girlfriend again and stay married.” No doubt by the time you read this, O'Connor's marriage will be annulled and she'll be happily remarried to a landscape gardener from Cleveland. Will she be violating the sanctity of marriage by doing so? Not by celebrity standards. On the contrary, she'll just be doing her job.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Ontario's self-styled “education premier,” damning criticism of one of his signature changes to the province's schools is nothing new.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back when Dalton McGuinty took power in 2003, some of his own bureaucrats and advisers cautioned that lowering class sizes wouldn't be worth the cost. In 2010, long after Mr. McGuinty's Liberals had charged ahead anyway, Malcolm Gladwell used a keynote speech at their policy conference to call the investment a “ludicrous” waste of money. Now, previewing his government-commissioned report on public-service reform, economist Don Drummond has said there “isn't really solid evidence” that it's had value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all that, the Liberals continue to insist that it was the right policy. The argument they make, which is more about intangibles than hard evidence, is quite reasonable. But its backward-looking nature suggests that Mr. Drummond might have a point about the need to reconsider class sizes as the deficit-plagued government embarks on a sweeping cost-cutting exercise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. McGuinty took office in 2003, they argue, the turmoil of the Mike Harris era had left a toxic atmosphere in schools. Teachers, feeling undervalued, were miserable. As a result, students were under-served. A growing number of parents were considering putting their kids into private schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals felt they needed a big gesture to restore faith in the system. And smaller class sizes, popular with teachers and easy for everyone else to grasp, fit the bill. So many hundreds of millions of dollars later, having hired thousands of additional teachers and renovated thousands of classrooms, the government now boasts that in the lowest grades about 90 per cent of classes have 20 students or fewer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time of implementation, insiders recall, then-education minister Gerard Kennedy assured skeptics within the education sector that it would be worth investing in some goodwill, so the government would be able to get buy-in for less flashy reforms. And in that regard, the strategy seems to have borne results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schools are certainly happier places than they were back then. And that broader reform agenda, which among other things involves intervention by teachers to prevent struggling students from slipping through the cracks, has received international recognition for its role in better outcomes for students – including higher standardized test scores and a lower high-school drop-out rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if smaller classes were really just about setting the right conditions, that leads to an obvious question: Is it time to declare mission accomplished, and move on a little?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No provincial government could have a better relationship with teachers than Mr. McGuinty's. It's been symbiotic; in return for generous workplace rules and wage increases, teachers have helped the Liberals meet both their policy and political goals, including helping during election campaigns. And understandably, the Liberals are less than eager to jeopardize that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if all that goodwill is real, then there should be some willingness to accept that the province's current financial challenges – a $16-billion deficit and slow economic growth and potential credit-rating downgrades – require some sacrifice. And it should at least be possible to consider, if not a return to Harris-era class sizes, whether caps and targets could safely be raised a little from where they are now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, there's another reason why Mr. Drummond's advice about class sizes – like that of others before him – is likely to be rejected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That argument about buying goodwill is the only one that's been made in private. Publicly, the Liberals have been much less nuanced, holding up class sizes as the main cause of students' improved results. It wasn't just presented as a means to an end; it was their signature education policy, helping them get elected and re-elected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having gone down that route, it would be very difficult politically to concede that it might not be quite so essential a policy after all. In retrospect, had the Liberals known the financial crunch to come, perhaps they would've been less eager to stake their reputations to a largely symbolic gesture.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent report by the International Monetary Fund warned about household debt in Canada, saying the economy is “vulnerable” to the overheated housing market and “adverse macroeconomic shocks.” The IMF also called for a review of the rules of <span class="companylink">Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation</span>, calling it “the key backstop to the housing market.” There is reason for concern; CMHC said last month mortgage debt accounts for 68 per cent of household debt.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The IMF's analysis of the Canadian economy implies that the Conservatives are on the right fiscal path, while the Liberals waffle about the economy and the NDP pushes for more spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upcoming spring budget will dominate debate when MPs return to the Hill. Finance Minister Jim Flaherty has signalled it will be an austerity budget. Such belt-tightening is to be commended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The IMF said the directors of its executive board support the “intention to gradually remove fiscal stimulus and return to fiscal balance over the medium term. They stressed that provincial governments also need to move ahead with fiscal consolidation.” Again, it praised the “exemplary macroeconomic management and financial sector oversight which have enabled Canada to weather the global crisis well” and expressed approval of the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span>'s monetary policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also stressed the “need for a concerted effort to contain the rising health care costs,” given the aging population. Mr. Flaherty announced recently that the government is slowing the rate of growth in health-care transfers to the provinces to match inflation growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals, meanwhile, have not gained traction on the economy. In an address to the Economic Club of Canada in Toronto in November, their interim leader, Bob Rae, called for long-term infrastructure spending, among other things. His speech, to a sell-out crowd, was criticized for missing the mark on the economy and failing to offer a sound road map, as promised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the NDP, it wants more spending, and at least one leadership candidate, Niki Ashton, is calling for “immediate stimulus.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At present, the Conservatives' economic plan is the best route ahead for Canada.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal NDP acquired, from the U.S. example in the presidential primaries, a pragmatic appreciation for multiple televised debates as a way to compare leadership contenders – even holding “watch parties” where partisans meet in front of TVs to debate the various candidates' attributes. These parties cost nothing and restore a faint sense of the 19th-century New England town hall meeting to the race. With only modest further adaptation, Canadian politics could benefit from having its own U.S.-style caucuses, the peculiar candidate-selection gatherings that turn political races into community discussions.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take last week's Republican caucuses in Iowa, all 1,700 of them, as an example. Organized as separate decision-making events in every precinct (or ward) in the state, Iowa's caucuses are the very essence of grassroots politics. Anyone can participate, merely by registering at the door – and independent Iowa voters did so last week, helping to set an attendance record. A single caucus typically attracts 60 or 70 voters who are able, in the course of an evening, to explain their choice of candidate. In the end, voters gather in groups and vote publicly – no secret ballots here – in a counting of raised hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The theoretical flaw in the caucuses is that they slightly modify the principle of “one man, one vote” – by favouring partisans and other knowledgeable, articulate voters. This is also the primary benefit of the caucuses. Recall Winston Churchill's dictum: “The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although marginally elitist, 19 states still use the caucuses in one form or another; 15 per cent of the delegates eventually chosen to attend the national conventions are determined by them. In Texas, for example, Democrats select 70 per cent of their delegates by a primary election, 30 per cent by caucuses – specifically to preserve the influence of party members who are more politically involved than the “average voter.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the caucuses preserve a grassroots populism that frightens some candidates. “They pick corn in Iowa,” Jon Huntsman, the former governor of Utah and former ambassador to China who aspires to the White House, said dismissively before the Iowa caucuses. “They pick presidents in New Hampshire.” Well, perhaps. But his explanation for blowing off Iowa sounds dubious. Since the 1970s, this farm state has served as a good, low-budget way for improbable presidential candidates to get noticed – which nicely balances whatever theoretical defects the caucuses may have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Iowa caucuses propelled Jimmy Carter, an obscure Democratic governor from Georgia, in 1976. (His second-place finish, behind “uncommitted voters,” made him look like a winner.) They propelled Barack Obama, an inexperienced Democratic senator from Illinois, in 2008. They propelled Republican Mike Huckabee, an unknown governor from Arkansas, in 2008; although he wasn't able to convert his first-place finish into a presidential nomination, he did get his own TV show on Fox. And they propelled Rick Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania – at least as far as Tuesday's primary in New Hampshire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iowa perpetuates other candidate-selection traditions. Last August, in Iowa's famous “straw poll” – the country's first popularity contest for Republican candidates in an election that doesn't count – former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty finished a distant third and abandoned his candidacy the next day. In an age of scientific polling, the straw poll might seem antiquated. In fact, it activates people months before real elections take place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American pursuit of the presidency, in a presidential election year, is perhaps the world's most mesmerizing democratic spectacle – a process that manages to produce a national consensus on presidential candidates within four months of New Year's Day. Or earlier. The great party conventions that will be staged this summer to nominate the Democratic and Republican candidates for the presidency will be held to affirm this consensus, not to form it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The paradox is that the Iowa caucuses, like Iowa's straw poll, decide nothing. They exist only as an advisory to the state's summer convention delegates, all 25 of them (amongst 2,200 for the country), who'll be selected in elections in coming months. Yet, though meaning nothing, they decide a lot. And they're great fun. Canadian caucuses, please.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I want to gain strength and lean muscle mass, but due to family commitments I can only strength-train two times per week. Am I lifting frequently enough to make strength improvements?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The amount of training that is needed to see improvement is largely dependent on one's initial fitness level. If you don't lift weights regularly, your initial strength level is most likely low. So two workouts a week will make a noticeable difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More experienced weightlifters usually need to lift three or four days a week to see results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately, frequency is not the only training variable that can be manipulated to produce strength gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since twice weekly lifting sessions are all you can commit to, I suggest that you become meticulous about controlling other training variables such as reps, sets, load and rest intervals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plan your workouts so that they cycle through “phases” of training. This will ensure you constantly challenge yourself and force your body to adapt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Try the following 10-week cycle:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phase One: Do two weeks of endurance training – three sets of each exercise for 12-15 reps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phase Two: Six weeks of strength and hypertrophy training. For two weeks, do four sets of 10-12 reps; for the next two weeks do four sets of 8-10 reps; and for the final two weeks do four sets of 6-8 reps of each exercise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phase three: Two weeks of relative strength and power training. Do four sets of 3-5 reps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take a recovery week after the 10-week cycle. Then repeat it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trainer's Tip</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Make sure you have an adequate recovery meal within 45 minutes of the end of your workout. If you are trying to build muscle, two quality workouts a week followed by a recovery meal will offer you the same or better results than doing three non-quality workouts a week with no proper post-exercise fuel.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Montreal, up until a few years ago, an English chef was an oxymoron. When I was a child, all the fine restaurants served classical French food, with the exception of Moishes, an exuberant Jewish steakhouse. And there was the Murray's chain, the ultimate WASP restaurant, where the food was bland and the waitresses unilingual. In the upper-middle-class private clubs, the food was modelled on British cuisine: overcooked lamb roast with mint sauce, poached salmon with béchamel and boiled potatoes.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowadays, the diversity of good restaurants in Montreal is mind-boggling. At the top are Normand Laprise's Toqué and Jérôme Ferrer's Europea, but dozens of chefs – some vastly experienced, some young and bold – are creating an extraordinary vibrant gastronomic scene, so much so that GQ's celebrated food critic Alan Richman recently told La Presse that Montreal has become, with San Francisco, “the most promising city in North America.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, there was a lone anglophone among the great Montreal chefs – James McGuire, the master bread maker who ran the delightful restaurant Le Passe-Partout for a while. But then a sort of revolution happened. A surprising number of young Quebec “anglos” embraced the career with gusto and began making their way up the busy and competitive gastronomic scene of Montreal. They're all bilingual, of course, and their young well-styled servers often have the distinctive accent of kids schooled in French immersion classes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a rule, their restaurants are on the rustic side (forget French elegance), with a relaxed ambience (Liverpool House, for example, calls itself “barnyard friendly”). Their food is a take on traditional North American cuisine, with many innovative and irreverent twists, as if cooking should be all fun and no dogma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best-known “anglo” chef is David MacMillan, co-owner of Liverpool House and Joe Beef, both located in the working-class district of Little Burgundy. My first impression was that it was a place for sports buffs, with too much red meat, too much noise and too much booze – a guys' place, with an unattractive name to boot. But as everyone was raving about it, we decided to go. Too late – now you have to call days ahead to get a table at Joe Beef, and then you'll have to wait at the bar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We settled for Nora Gray, an Italian restaurant whose chef is Emma Cardarelli, a pretty young woman who looks like a kid but is a former cook at Liverpool House. We had stuffed calamari and squash ravioli with pine nuts, then lamb with pistachios and milk-fed piglet with chestnuts – a delight from beginning to end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the slow days after Christmas, we managed to get a table at DNA, located in the grand décor of a former bank in Old Montreal. Our dinner was unbelievable – and the chef was, too, a red-haired, tattooed young guy who looks like a friendly parking attendant rather than the creator of such exquisite food as al dente pappardelle, with wild mushrooms in a mascarpone sauce and sweetbreads perfectly crunchy outside and tender inside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DNA chef Derek Dammann buys his animals whole from selected producers and is a committed “locavore” – which is why he was recently invited to visit the experimental lab of Noma, the Copenhagen restaurant that succeeded elBulli of Catalonia as the most avant-garde restaurant in the world and where chef René Redzepi uses only ingredients grown in Scandinavia (an exploit in itself). Our young “anglo” chefs are now thriving on the international scene.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An unknown hand perpetrated the unthinkable – painting swastikas on headstones in a Jewish cemetery.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a criminal act and a cowardly one, too, a desecration designed to disgust and perhaps to intimidate. There is disgust. There is no intimidation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a grey Sunday afternoon, people came in their multitudes to gather on hallowed ground on a hillside overlooking the city. They filed past a gatepost bearing the Hebrew inscription Bais HaChayim (house of the living) before gathering around a memorial to the Holocaust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 600 came for a vigil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All of us coming out here and standing together means we will not be silent in the face of a hate crime,” Rabbi Harry Brechner of the Congregation Emanu-El synagogue told the crowd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the final day of last year, it was discovered swastikas had been painted on five headstones. One had also been defaced with a white-power symbol, as well as the scrawled words “Jewish scum.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the new year, a removal agent was applied to the monuments, which were wrapped in a see-through sheet. It gave them the appearance of having been wounded in battle. The wrap is now off, the blotched areas on which the solvent had been applied looking like scars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each of the vandalized headstones tells a story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most modest of the damaged ones is adorned not by a Star of David but with an engraved Maple Leaf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It marks the wartime burial site of Joseph L. Vince, a 44-year-old private with the Royal Canadian Regiment, who died of heart failure in 1915.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearby is a granite marker for Annabelle and Eli Beam, who lived at 15 Linden St., one house from the Dallas Road waterfront in Fairfield. He owned two businesses on Wharf Street – Pacific Sanitary Bag Co. and the Victoria Junk Agency. He died in 1940. Her death date is now obscured. The stone awaits further repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A monument of pink granite honours Charles A. Freedman, a theatre manager who had made his fortune in the Klondike gold rush. One March evening in 1908, he returned home from a night at the theatre with his wife when he stumbled across a prowler in the pantry. The men struggled, the intruder pressing a rusty .38 revolver to the left side of Freedman's chest before pulling the trigger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bleeding man chased his attacker out of the house, then fell, mortally wounded. “Marion, I'm shot,” he told his wife. “I'm done for.” He died minutes later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other damaged monuments mark the resting spot of three brothers and their families. Born in Germany, they made their fortunes as merchants on the Pacific coast. The eldest was only 23 years old when he got a contract to build a trail from the Stikine River to the Cassiar gold fields, along which he collected a toll of two cents per pound of freight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simon Leiser and Company became the province's largest grocery wholesaler with several stores in the mining towns dotting Vancouver Island. In 1896, he built a red brick warehouse at 524 Yates St. alongside Waddington Alley in downtown Victoria. The building still stands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His brother, Gustav, went into business here as a dry-goods merchant, while Max, the younger of the trio, imported wines, liquors and cigars. Gustav died unexpectedly of pneumonia, aged 40, in 1896. Max later built a handsome four-storey brick building at the corner of Blanshard and Johnson Streets. It was called the Kaiserhof Hotel and boasted a beer garden at the rear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1915, the passenger liner Lusitania was torpedoed by a German U-boat with great loss of life, including James Dunsmuir Jr., the 21-year-old scion of the Vancouver Island coal-mining fortune. The news enraged a crowd of men in Victoria. Led by soldiers in uniform, a mob of 500 attacked the Kaiserhof, since renamed the Blanshard Hotel. The bar was trashed. Another $25,000 worth of damage was done to Simon Leiser's warehouse. Other businesses owned by those with German names, many of them Jewish, were attacked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It mattered not at all to the frenzied throng that the Leisers, prominent in the arts and business in Victoria, had long since become loyal citizens of Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A century ago, a mob acted in mindless fury. The recent vandalism reflects a similarly ugly spirit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday, another large crowd – this one motivated by love, not hate – gathered around the graves of people named Beam and Vince and Freedman and Leiser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The grounds of the Jewish cemetery were consecrated in 1859, desecrated in 2011, venerated in 2012.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE GAME CHANGER</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toward a concussion cure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As number of players with head injuries continues to grow, it's time for <span class="companylink">NHL</span> to seriously address the problem and move forward with solutions. Here are six priority considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second half of the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> season begins Monday with no hope in sight for relief from the league's biggest problem – concussions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sidney Crosby and Chris Pronger head a long list of <span class="companylink">NHL</span> stars who may not or will not play again this season because of head injuries. And yet, the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> brass refuses to admit this is a serious problem that needs to be tackled on many fronts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or maybe the league actually recognizes the severity of the problem but is loath to admit it publicly. Either way, the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> needs to marshal the considerable forces it has access to and take bigger steps to find solutions. Here are the areas that should be under consideration:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Culture Far too many <span class="companylink">NHL</span> players are too careless or have too little respect for their peers when it comes to hits to the head. Look at the elbow Rene Bourque of the Calgary Flames threw at the head of Nicklas Backstrom of the Washington Capitals last week. <span class="companylink">NHL</span> disciplinarian Brendan Shanahan gave Bourque a five-game suspension. He needs to come down harder on this type of offender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equipment The league is working with designers and manufacturers to come up with softer shoulder pads and elbow pads. A dozen players are already testing a new prototype of shoulder pads. This equipment must be adopted – and players forced to use it – as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treatment The <span class="companylink">NHL</span> should tap into the long list of reputable concussion experts willing to help and develop a sensible plan for treating concussions. Then it should get the <span class="companylink">National Hockey League Players' Association</span> to join it in strongly encouraging the players to follow it. The chiropractor and his unorthodox methods Crosby turned to got a lot of media attention. But in several interviews with concussion experts, I did not hear one unequivocally endorse those methods, to put it mildly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rule changes All hits to the head need to be outlawed, not just the blind-side ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Game changes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since increased speed is responsible for the rise in concussions more than any other factor, the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s general managers need to seriously consider ways to counter this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most popular suggestion, putting the centre red line back in play to slow speed through the neutral zone, requires discussion, as does widening the ice surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fighting Once it was easy to say hardly anyone was seriously injured in a hockey fight. Then size, steroids, boxing and mixed-martial-arts lessons entered the picture. The majority of concussions in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> do not come from fights but the game has evolved to where pure fighters are not needed. Getting rid of goons will remove a certain percentage of injuries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even an unlikely success in the above areas will not guarantee the elimination of concussions. As long as hockey is a physical game – and despite the bleating of the game's hawks, it always will be – the chance of being concussed will be there. But that's all there should be, a long-shot chance.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIVE GAMES TO WATCH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sabres at Leafs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Leafs started their long January homestand in style with wins over the Tampa Bay Lightning and Winnipeg Jets, which kept them in a playoff position in the Eastern Conference. Now they need to beat Buffalo in regulation time to keep the good times rolling. Tuesday, 7 p.m., Sportsnet Ontario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blues at Canadiens</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's always fun when a former Montreal player comes to call, in this case St. Louis goaltender Jaroslav Halak. While few will argue the decision to keep Carey Price instead of Halak, the lack of return on the goalie is a sore point, even considering Lars Eller's big night last week, as well as the Habs' current woes. Tuesday, 7:30 p.m., RDS, TSN-Habs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharks at Wild</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minnesota went into a swoon after lingering at the top of the league all season, while San Jose's hot streak has it moving into the top four of the Western Conference. Tuesday, 7:30 p.m., TSN 2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hawks at Wings</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hey, any time these Original Six rivals hook up, you have to watch. Especially when both teams are among the best in the Western Conference. Saturday, 12:30 p.m., TSN 2, NBC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kings at Flames</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the Kings turned themselves around with the arrival of Darryl Sutter as their new head coach, you know they will want to win this one as much as he does. Since there is nothing like a Sutter scorned, he wants to beat the team that dumped him as GM very, very badly. Saturday, 10 p.m., CBC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All times Eastern</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STORYLINES TO WATCH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A SUTTER RETURNS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Saturday, Darryl Sutter will return to the Scotiabank Saddledome for the first time since the Calgary Flames pushed him out as general manager a little more than a year ago. While he is going back in a position of strength – the Los Angeles Kings are 5-1-3 since Sutter was hired as head coach on Dec. 20 – Sutter can expect a rough ride from the Flames' fans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a GM, Sutter makes a good coach. By the time he was shown the door, Sutter had the Flames in such a mess that incoming GM Jay Feaster is still hamstrung by a long list of big contracts awarded to underachieving players. But things are finally looking up, even though the Flames are not going to be in the playoff picture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirteen players will have their contracts expire this summer and nine will be unrestricted free agents. So look for Feaster to be busy in the trade market over the next six weeks until the Feb. 27 trade deadline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SPEAKING OF Deadlines …</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Anaheim Ducks general manager Bob Murray threatening to trade everybody on his roster except Teemu Selanne and Saku Koivu, the action could heat up well before the Feb. 27 deadline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naturally, the prospect of landing Corey Perry, Ryan Getzlaf or Bobby Ryan has <span class="companylink">NHL</span> GMs buzzing away at Murray's cellphone, but there are some other teams that add to the intrigue. After an appearance in the Eastern Conference final last spring, the Tampa Bay Lightning are in terrible shape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GM Steve Yzerman needs to continue the playoff appearances to keep his fan support and his needs list is topped by a goaltender and a defenceman. While Toronto Maple Leafs GM Brian Burke insists he is not looking for a goaltender, he is after a top-six forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Murray is probably already tired of listening to Burke's pitches for Getzlaf, Ryan and Perry or all three.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BACK TO FLAMES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Feaster says he has no plans to trade Jarome Iginla because he expects the well-loved forward, who has a no-move contract, to retire in a Flames jersey. But there are lots of other possibilities on his team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top two are goaltender Mikka Kiprusoff and defenceman Jay Bouwmeester. The latter's trade value is severely compromised by his mediocrity since landing in Calgary and a contract that has two years to run at $6.8-million (U.S.) a year. But Kiprusoff would command a high price from, say, Yzerman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">******</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A SALUTE TO A WORKING MAN</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1,202</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sean O'Donnell, 40, will play his 1,202nd <span class="companylink">NHL</span> game on Tuesday night for the Chicago Blackhawks, quite an accomplishment when you consider he was hardly ever more than the fifth or sixth defenceman on any of the teams he's played for. Too often, players like that are waived into retirement in favour of younger bodies, although McDonnell is dependable enough defensively that he always found work.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not since the brutal sectarian conflict that engulfed the country in 2006 and 2007 has Iraq been as dangerously close as it is now to civil war. Meanwhile, the Obama administration, eager to close the chapter on the U.S. invasion, is portraying the country as a democratic model for the Middle East. The reality is that the U.S. is leaving behind a budding police state.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki continues to purge his opponents and consolidate his authority. He is now on the verge of abandoning last year's power-sharing agreement, which formed a government of national unity. Vice-president Tareq al-Hashemi has fled to Kurdistan after authorities issued a warrant for his arrest, a decision that added to sectarian tensions. In the weeks before the U.S. military withdrawal, Mr. al-Maliki rounded up hundreds of Iraqis accused of being former Baath Party members. Security forces detain and abuse dissenting academics, activists and journalists with impunity, yet they are not being effective against vicious and spectacular assaults by terrorists, such as the ones that killed more than 70 Iraqis, mostly civilians, last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. al-Maliki is right to use his security forces against the scourge of chronic terrorism. Extremists are determined to defeat what they see as an American-imposed democracy, no matter how many civilians are slaughtered in the process. But Mr. al-Maliki, who left Saddam Hussein's Iraq with a death warrant against him, should know all too well the repercussions of authoritarianism. If Iraq's fragile democracy is to have a chance, he and the country's leaders must subordinate their own political interests, to avoid risking a partitioning of Iraq or a return to one-man-one-party rule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration is proceeding with the sale to Iraq of almost $11-billion in weapons and training. However, U.S. and international assistance to Iraq's security forces ought to be conditional on the government's commitment to its new constitution. Thousands of Iraqi and American lives were sacrificed in ridding Iraq of Saddam Hussein. A slide back to dictatorship, when much of the region is striving for democracy, would render their sacrifices meaningless.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would you watch a show that has been called “blisteringly vulgar and knife-edged”?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, you should. The show is House of Lies (TMN, Movie Central, 10 p.m.) and brace yourself – yes, the language is rough and raw, and the attitude is formidably cynical. If the coziness of Downton Abbey is your cup of tea, House of Lies is not for you. If the episodic hokum of network sitcoms is your preference, you'll be taken aback by the scathing scatological humour of this one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time you read this, I will be in Los Angeles, for the mid-season presentation by U.S. broadcasters and, in the TV racket, it is the best of times. The mid-winter period of despair – about failing shows and mediocre ratings – has given way to optimism. Surely there will be a great show that galvanizes viewers and says something about the times we live in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House of Lies is one of those shows. It is astonishingly ambitious, funny, serious, and entertaining. Best of all, it speaks to the mood of skepticism about the way business is done in the United States, who makes the money and how they acquire it. This is a show that reflects much of what the Occupy movement is about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We meet Marty Kaan (Don Cheadle) the hottest hustler at management-consulting firm Galweather &amp; Stearn. When we first encounter him, there's a woman, naked except for her stilettos, asleep beside him. It turns out she's his ex-wife, passed out in a blur of drugs, and Marty's first task of the day is to get her out of his apartment before their son sees her. Later, in a lovely twist, we learn that the ex-wife, Monica (Dawn Olivieri), is also a management consultant and competes against Marty for business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stuff happens but, pretty soon, they stop. Then Marty addresses the camera, explaining what management consultants do. He does it in furious and colourful language, contempt drenching everything. Among the few printable remarks is this – “You have to violate every space, every molecule [of the client] so that all that's left is ‘yes.'” Marty is a weasel and he knows it. He takes companies for a ride and he loathes every client. He's conning them into spending money on ridiculous advice and the suckers pay him and his team an awful lot of money. It is no coincidence that the first client encountered on the show is a mortgage company suffering the slings and arrows of public contempt for helping bring the U.S. economy to where it is now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marty's team, Jeannie (Kristen Bell), Clyde (Ben Schwartz) and Doug (Josh Lawson) get daily rants from Marty about the stupidity of clients and the necessity of conning everyone to the max. They're still learning, but Marty knows it all and talks in what is probably the most foul language ever heard on TV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The series (based on the book House of Lies: How Management Consultants Steal Your Watch and Then Tell You the Time by Martin Kihn) is one very dark comedy. It bristles with rage – rage at the self-righteous greed of businesses and consultants, rage at the ease with which vast amounts of money are made and squandered. There's a lot of sex, none of it loving. Racism is confronted head-on. As a black man, Marty is attuned to the signals but he's not angry. He's merely a tad more contemptuous of the sucker who would rather be conned by a white woman than a black man.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, yes, it sure is “blisteringly vulgar and knife-edged” and you won't feel swell after watching it, like you might feel after chuckling at The Big Bang Theory. But you will know you've watched a rare excursion into comedy that accosts contemporary values with gusto. Sometimes a comedy is no laughing matter, and the better for it. Just watch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highlights to come</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a busy week in Canadian TV and it will be impossible to mention everything while covering the midseason shenanigans from La-La Land. Tomorrow it's worth your while to see The L.A. Complex (Tuesday, CTV and MuchMusic, 9 p.m.), a show promoted as being about “Hook-ups, Hang-ups and Call-backs,” which is true. Set among a group of aspiring Canadian actors looking for their big break in Hollywood, it's a soap with some smarts and well-drawn characters. It comes from the Degrassi producers. Also tomorrow there's the debut of Arctic Air (Tuesday, CBC, 9 p.m.), which is a terrifically old-fashioned adventure-entertainment set in Yellowknife. And don't forget the return of the drollery on Republic of Doyle (Wednesday, CBC, 9 p.m.), with big-time, Oscar-winning actor Russell Crowe joining the series as a guest star for the opening episode.</p>
