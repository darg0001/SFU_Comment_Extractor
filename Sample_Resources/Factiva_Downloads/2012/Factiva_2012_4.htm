<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will soon be 40 years since he took on the status quo in hockey.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roy McMurtry, a former attorney-general of Ontario, will turn 80 this spring, the dark, wavy hair now whitened but the sleepy eyes, the easy laugh and the big, rolling shoulders not changed at all since they tagged him “Attorney-General McTurkey” in Philadelphia and the head of the NHL told him to butt out and mind his own business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McMurtry took on the job as “top cop” in the Ontario cabinet in 1975, the year after his brother, William, who died five years ago, delivered his famous report on violence in minor hockey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concern back then was assault and bench-clearing brawls. It may be the word “concussion” never appeared on the sports pages back then, but the concern for player safety and public impression was not that far removed from today's concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The provincial government of the day asked Bill McMurtry to investigate violence following a number of incidents, key among them a decision by one junior team to withdraw from a championship series out of fear. He was asked to examine the “causes” of such violence at the lower levels and concluded that the No. 1 cause was the influence of the NHL and the use of violence as a tactical instrument, most dramatically illustrated by the rising success of the “Broad Street Bullies” Philadelphia Flyers, who won the Stanley Cup in 1974 and 1975.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was outrage – including many in the media – over the audacity of anyone thinking professional hockey could not police itself. Bill McMurtry prevailed, however, concluding that “the evidence was clear and overwhelming that the conduct and standards applied in the National Hockey League were having a profound effect on virtually every boy playing amateur hockey in every league regardless of age or standard of competition.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NHL president Clarence Campbell promptly dismissed the report as “a product of the Commissioner's imagination.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Roy McMurtry became attorney-general months later, he said he would take his brother's report to heart. He warned the two main leagues, NHL and World Hockey Association, that police would watch any games played in Ontario. There was nothing wrong with using physical force in a tough game – both McMurtrys had played competitive hockey and Roy had been good enough in football to be offered a CFL tryout – but “inappropriate violence” was unacceptable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It didn't take long for action. First charged was Dan Maloney of the Detroit Red Wings for repeatedly banging the head of an unconscious Toronto player, Brian Glennie, against the ice. Maloney was acquitted. Months later, the Flyers came to Toronto and set a playoff record for penalties, leading to four Philadelphia players being charged. McMurtry was vilified in Philadelphia, the district attorney even accusing him of “a clear perversion of the office in which he sits.” All four players pleaded guilty, though punishment was light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coincidence or not, there are no longer bench-clearing brawls. The NHL acted strongly and effectively to end them. Change is possible, even when it comes reluctantly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It comes as no surprise, then, that some of those who have been long working to bring an end to head shots and fighting in professional hockey – and consequently an end to those concussions that can indeed be prevented – have been coming to Roy McMurtry for advice. He gives it freely and with encouragement: stick to it, even when they ridicule you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The fact of the matter is,” McMurtry says from the downtown law office he still comes to daily, “that it hasn't been a concern when it should have been at the highest levels of sport.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In large part, this is because “we didn't know.” In another part, it is because we don't want to know. But the scientific evidence is surely irrefutable, he says, not to mention the obvious evidence that many of the best players in the world are no longer able to play because of brain injuries that are, to a significant extent, preventable. It is a cultural change that is required, he says, one that goes from the highest levels of the game to minor hockey – “but we shouldn't be intimidated by that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as there was concern four decades ago that the level of violence in the game was causing young players and their parents to reconsider the sport, the level of injury in the game today is having the same effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Society can change and society can demand change, McMurtry believes, and he points to “the cigarette manufacturers who said for years there was no problem with smoking.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That change is necessary, he says, because the points in his brother's summary are as strong today as they were in 1974: “Sport, and particularly hockey, need not be a symptom of a sick society. Hockey can be an effective instrument to improve the social conditions. Hockey can be a positive educational force, a model, to instill values such as co-operation, personal discipline, tolerance and understanding.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Look,” says the man who took professional hockey to court over violence, “if the NHL played on some other planet I wouldn't care less what they do to each other. But they don't play on another planet and everything they do has an influence on every youngster who plays the game.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Crown-first-nations summit was, in the words of Chief Roger Augustine, “a 100-per-cent success.” But if first steps are to become a journey, three guideposts must point the way.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There must be money. There must be education reform. And the decision of first nations to collaborate with rather than confront the federal government must be affirmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The word from those who attended both public and private sessions on Tuesday ranged from cautious optimism to jubilation after Prime Minister Stephen Harper shuffled plans so he could spend a full day with chiefs from the Assembly of First Nations, part of what Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Peter Penashue promised would be “a reset” in relations between chiefs and Crown. The meeting ended with praise from each side for the other, along with a communiqué that promised to break new ground in economic development, first nations governance and resolving land claims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ultimate shared goal is action to displace the 136-year-old Indian Act's antiquated clauses chunk by chunk until it withers from irrelevance. This was the mutual good will that Tuesday's summit achieved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But goodwill has been squandered in the past, and could be again. Many chiefs warned of rising, seething impatience among younger members on reserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don't know how much patience is left for our people,” declared Chief Dean Sayers of Batchewana First Nation in northern Ontario. “I don't think there's much patience left.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what must happen, before patience runs out and barricades go up? First must come swift action to improve education on reserves, where an estimated 60 per cent of students fail to complete high school. A joint panel sponsored by the Conservative government and the AFN, which will report in February, is expected to recommend new region-wide or province-wide native school boards to pool resources, manage schools, supervise teachers and create native-centric curriculums that also meet provincial standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Harper government is serious about education reform, it will implement the panel's recommendations through a First Nations Education Act written in collaboration with the chiefs and buttressed with increased funding for schools that have been starved of dollars for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Money will also be the key when Finance Minister Jim Flaherty brings down his budget in March. All departments face cuts, and Aboriginal and Northern Affairs will be no exception.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if that budget doesn't commit to improving health, housing and education on reserves, then the chiefs will turn against this government, replacing good will with anger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which attitude prevails will be evident in July, when Shawn Atleo is either returned or defeated as National Chief of the AFN. The success of Tuesday's meeting appeared to vindicate Mr. Atleo's strategy of working with the Harper government rather than fighting against it. His re-election would signal that the national chiefs back his consensus-building approach. His defeat would signal that the chiefs have given up on co-operation. These three signposts only get things started. In his remarks, Mr. Harper acknowledged that prosperity for many reserves will depend on their ability to profit through jobs and revenue from the natural resources that surround them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, real progress will require the rarest of all commodities between government and first-nations leaders: trust. It is hard to imagine such a day. But at least Tuesday's meeting marked a step down a path both sides claim they want to follow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That was fun,” Quebec regional Chief Ghislain Picard quipped in wrapping up the day. “Let's do it again.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they might, if Stephen Harper really does walk his talk.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody asked me for an opinion on the allegedly important news that some outfit intends to make a Canadian version of The Bachelor. This is a surprising aberration, you must agree, given the fame and eminence of this column.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If anybody had asked, I'd say that the premise, producing a Canadian copy of a fading U.S. reality show now in its 16th season, is pathetic. Piteous. A craven and utterly unoriginal attempt to get some juice from a brand that has long since lost its lustre, even as fun TV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Copycat production of something like The Bachelor is easy. What's difficult but should be attempted more often is the mining of the culture of the Maritime provinces and Newfoundland and Labrador for sources of TV entertainment. It's totally true. Stick with me here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news of the Canadian Bachelor thing is one of those instances that makes it even more difficult to explain Canadian TV to outsiders. When this column is in L.A. for the TV critics press tour, the topic of Canadian TV arises only very occasionally. Nobody cares much because we do a lot of dumb things like a Canadian Bachelor and Canada's Got Talent. Mind you, if I told somebody from a U.S. publication that Russell Crowe was about to do a guest role in a Canadian series, which I did, the response is extreme puzzlement. What on earth is this Republic of Doyle?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good question. Tonight's Republic of Doyle (CBC, 9 p.m.) is an episode called Hot Package. It is summarized thus: “The Doyles are hired to recover a missing item belonging to a beautiful client; Nikki asks Jake a favour he wants nothing to do with; Tinny enlists Des in keeping a secret.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The episode will air, as usual, with a warning about “mature content.” This is ridiculous. There is nothing mature about Republic of Doyle that you need to be warned about. The style of the show is anchored in what might be called the pre-ironic period and is the better for it. It accounts for its popularity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What happens tonight is that Jake Doyle (Allan Hawco) and his dad Malachy (Sean McGinley) are at an antiques and collectibles store, which happens to be run by a fella named Ned. The fact that Ned is played by Mark Critch from 22 Minutes will give you a clue about what unfolds – sassy exchanges. Or what's known in some places as “slagging.” That's followed by the entry of a comely woman and Jake Doyle is instantly smitten. Almost immediately said comely woman's ex-boyfriend shows up and acts boorishly. Jake steps in and soon enough he's sent flying through a glass window onto the street. His dad slags him for this carry-on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a missing cigarette case that must be found. There's a dead body that goes missing and must be found. Meanwhile, in one backstory Jake's ex-wife's new husband is under surveillance, suspected of being disrespectful to his new missus. And young Tinny is suspected of not having gone to England, as people thought. About every five minutes Jake Doyle is brawling. In between he's making things complicated with the approximately 15 women he has a thing for. They slag him, he slags them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pretty much the same antics unfold every week. But a key is the anchoring footage of St. John's, looking utterly gorgeous, and that Great Big Sea music roaring away at just the right intervals. The show is so firmly located in St. John's and presented with such flourish that the setting seems thrillingly exotic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The emphatic setting is one reason why there is an enormous gulf between Republic of Doyle and other Canadian-made cop shows such as Rookie Blue and Flashpoint. It's about this naked devotion to place. While Flashpoint can be said to be set in Toronto, there is little of the texture of the city evident on the series. Republic of Doyle, for all its extremes of silliness, is loaded with the feel of Newfoundland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's more than place. It's that texture thing. Think about it now – what has actually worked as successful, mass entertainment on Canadian TV in the last decade? That would be 22 Minutes, Rick Mercer Report and Trailer Park Boys. Temperamentally and tonally, these are Maritime or Newfoundland shows. The emphasis on language and dry wit, the slagging. The tone is often one of deadpan skepticism about authority, received wisdom and pretty much everything that is generic in popular culture and politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is, obviously, a keen appetite for this kind of TV entertainment. The fact that the new CBC comedy Mr. D has been an instant ratings success can be explained by its having elements of the same texture and tone as those other shows I've listed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there's appetite, it should be filled. And Republic of Doyle, as deliriously foolish and preposterous as it is, points the way forward. Scoundrels and shenanigans in St. John's. That's all, but boy does it work. It's the republic of us.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This isn't the first time David Dombrowski has answered a damn-the-torpedoes call from ownership by blowing somebody out of the water.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was Montreal Expos owner Charles Bronfman who told Dombrowski – then known as The Boy GM – in 1989 that time was wasting and he wanted what Dombrowski understood to be one last shot at the postseason. So the Expos shocked the baseball world by acquiring Mark Langston from the Seattle Mariners for Randy Johnson, Gene Harris and Brian Holman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Expos were one of the stories of that season before collapsing in August en route to finishing fourth in the National League East. Langston left as a free agent and Bronfman promptly put his stake in the team up for sale and there it was. Forget the handy scapegoating of Jeffrey Loria; major-league baseball in Montreal had taken its first step out the door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results will be far less Draconian if this latest shocker by Dombrowski, now the Detroit Tigers' GM, doesn't turn out. There is no indication that Tigers owner Mike Ilitch is about to sell the team, but he will be 83 and the Tigers owe him a World Series.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a baseball point of view, Dombrowski's agreement on Tuesday with Prince Fielder on a nine-year, $214-million (all currency U.S.) contract probably carries less risk than that Langston deal. It's just money, after all, and the Tigers have shown an ability to manage payrolls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dombrowski must surely realize that Ilitch's lifetime as a sportsman is at the legacy stage, what with the NHL due to turn its annual outdoor classic next season into a celebration of his ownership of the Detroit Red Wings, so why not roll the dice with Fielder?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Tigers could have been favourites heading into the season without Fielder, even with designated hitter Victor Martinez out for the season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament. But talk about taking no chances. In landing Fielder, they have a left-hand-hitting monster mashing behind righty hitting cleanup man Miguel Cabrera.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fielder, a three-time all-star, hit .299 with 38 home runs and 120 RBIs last season with the Milwaukee Brewers. He has averaged 40 homers and 113 RBIs over the past five years. He's also been among the most durable players in the majors, appearing in at least 157 games in each of the last six seasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a lot of money to have tied up in, um, soft-bodied, beer-league types (Cabrera, who said Tuesday he will move to third base if manager Jim Leyland wants him to, has four years left on an eight-year, $152.3-million contract, and Martinez will have two more years remaining on a four-year, $50-million deal if he recovers as expected in time for the 2013 season).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it will matter naught if Ilitch wins the World Series. If he doesn't? At least Dombrowski won't have to watch anybody pitch his way to the Hall of Fame the way Johnson did after he was dealt away from the Expos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So baseball learns once again it is never wise to laugh at Scott Boras, Fielder's agent, who told anybody who would listen early in the off-season the starting price for Fielder was more than the annual average value of existing contracts signed by Mark Teixeira ($22.5-million a year) and Joe Mauer ($23-million a year). Oh yeah, and Fielder's contract would be for 10 years, thanks. Admit it, some of you laughed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet here we are, unusually late by free-agent signing standards, and Boras gets the money and the terms he wanted. All this in an off-season in which two of the usual market movers, the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox, had already committed to first basemen (Teixeira and Adrian Gonzalez, respectively), in which the Los Angeles Dodgers were hampered by cloudy ownership, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim had already cast their lot with Albert Pujols, and the Chicago Cubs, mysteriously, went into hibernation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What of the Toronto Blue Jays in all this? The guess here is the team kicked the tires on Fielder just as it did with Jose Reyes, but more with an eye toward sussing out the market. (Nine years? Sorry, I'm not having that, not for any player.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Blue Jays are going to try to kill teams with relief pitching and homegrown hitting this season, their front office believing it is pointless to test the resolve of owner <span class="companylink">Rogers Communications Inc</span>. In the meantime, they are among a group of teams whose road to the promised land of the wild card just became a whole lot harder. But that's just off-season conjecture and guesstimation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we know for sure is this: He who laughs last has Mike Ilitch's phone number, and that he who laughs best is almost always named Scott Boras.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pragmatic, incremental approach to aboriginal problems that Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Shawn Atleo, National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, seem to have agreed to, holds promise. Aboriginal peoples have too many desperate needs (in education, housing, economic development and health) to lose time on big, contentious fixes or distractions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Crown-First Nations Gathering on Tuesday was about laying the groundwork for a “partnership.” But it also produced a commitment by the Canadian government that it will co-operate to remove barriers to first nations governance, and to improve accountability on both sides. Governor-General David Johnston spoke about “returning to first principles,” and these should be deemed among them.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National Chief Atleo answered skeptics with an eloquent and powerful plea to work together as partners with the federal government. He spoke of “the sacred alliance between our ancestors, the leaders of the First Nations and the British Crown.” He praised Mr. Harper for signing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and for his historic apology for the damage inflicted by the residential schools. He had sat with his grandmother, holding her hand during that apology, and quoted her as saying, “Grandson, they are beginning to see us.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harper said he would “replace elements” of the 1876 Indian Act with “more modern legislation and procedures.” He stressed the practical gains that come through co-operation, and through providing aboriginal communities with the tools they need to advance. Aboriginal communities should feel confident they can work with this government. The First Nations Land Management Act, under which scores of first nations manage their own lands, is one example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What new tools emerged from the summit? There was an agreement to create an economic task force to “unlock the economic potential” of reserves, and to implement an education panel's future recommendations as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shadow of Attawapiskat, a desperately crowded, remote reserve in Northern Ontario, hung over the summit. Symbolism is good, but perhaps not so good as a house that fathers, mothers, uncles, aunts and children can live in together. If, out of the summit, aboriginal leaders and government work together to identify and prevent the next Attawapiskat, the symbolism will have been put to good use.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">History does repeat itself, it would appear.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pierre Trudeau had his constitutional conferences that involved aboriginal leaders. Brian Mulroney had his too, plus a big session in British Columbia to launch the B.C. Treaty Commission process, a discouraging flop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jean Chrétien often went on about how splendidly he got along with the chiefs, having been Indian Affairs minister early in his career. Paul Martin had his Kelowna Accord. Stephen Harper had his reconciliation/apology statement over residential schools and, Tuesday, a day-long session with the chiefs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along the way, the national leadership of the Assembly of First Nations has obviously changed, as have the local chiefs. But the dialogue seldom changes, on either side of the table. Sonorous clichés mix with history lessons about “settlers” and their perfidy, lessons are repeated about the “honour of the Crown” and treaties that are/were not respected. Discreet references are offered about the discouraging economic and social statistics of aboriginal people, complaints are aired about insufficient public funding, occasional threats are made about the potential for violence and then things continue pretty much as before, out there in the real world, far removed from the conferences with their ceremonies and solemnities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Department of Indian Affairs recognizes 615 first nations. Within that tapestry are 60 languages, most of which are in decline for lack of population. According to the last Statistics Canada survey (2006), 29 per cent of aboriginals said they could speak well enough to carry on a conversation in their native language. Off reserve, the figure fell to 12 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slowly, aboriginals are drifting away from reserves (where the chiefs dominate) because, despite whatever cultural support the reserves provide, many have little or no economic base, which is the real story behind the headlines about social and housing problems along James Bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking of housing, that same Statscan survey found 44 per cent of houses on reserve in need of “major repairs” – up from 36 per cent in 1966 – compared with 9 per cent of homes in rural Canada. What accounts for such shocking indifference?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it because property ownership barely exists, so a renter mentality takes over? Is it because the people in the houses have lost self-respect? Is it because the houses are often crowded, or poorly made to begin with? Is it because governments haven't spent enough, the usual answer from communities? Where are the chiefs who are supposed to be running their communities? Whatever the explanations, such dilapidation is a scandal, and one reason, among many, for the drift away from reserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday, education was much on everyone's mind, as it has been at past conferences. The gaps between aboriginal and non-aboriginal education accomplishments are wide and dangerous – dangerous because it stunts economic opportunities and can lead to dead-end lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Native chiefs say communities should run their own school systems, which makes sense in some but not all cases. They also complain, not without reason, that funding has not kept pace, with their birth rate being so much higher than Canada's average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What aboriginal groups really need is more economic opportunity of the kind that comes with education and a bigger share in development projects. If aboriginals have land with natural resources to be extracted, or pipelines or hydro lines to cross it, then they should benefit from royalties, direct ownership and jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This sharing will definitely help some aboriginal communities, but will leave others with little because their lands are too isolated. There's also the fact that 60 per cent of aboriginals now live off the reserves. They might share in the royalties negotiated by their reserve, but resource projects won't help them in large- or even medium-sized cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic development, and how to achieve it, will be at the heart of the discussions between Mr. Harper's government and the chiefs. It's the kind of language the Conservatives understand and favour, and it's what aboriginal leaders want.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will also be at the heart of the re-election campaign of AFN national chief Shawn Atleo, who will be seriously challenged, and possibly unseated, at July's convention in Toronto.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's estimated as many as 80 per cent of teenagers experience some degree of acne, a condition that makes them feel isolated, diminishes self-esteem and can cause depression.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acne can begin in adulthood, too, with the majority of cases – 75 per cent – occurring in women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people who've battled acne attest that certain foods aggravate their skin. Yet most dermatologists contend there's no scientific link between diet and acne. The prevailing view is that the food-acne connection is a myth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent studies are, however, challenging this stance. Dairy products and high-glycemic foods (e.g. sugary foods and those made from refined flour) have been shown to worsen acne, while omega-3 fats may alleviate it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Body weight may also play a role. A study published this month in the Archives of Dermatology found that among 3,600 boys and girls, aged 18 and 19, girls who were overweight or obese were twice as likely to have acne as their leaner peers. In boys, there was no link between acne and overweight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or greater was associated with acne in girls even after accounting for diet, smoking and mental stress. (BMI is calculated as your weight in kilograms divided by the square of your height in metres. In adolescents aged 18 and older, a BMI of 25 or more signals overweight; 30 more indicates obesity.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acne is caused by the combination of too much sebum and a buildup of dead skin cells. (Sebum is an oily fluid secreted by glands in pores to keep skin and hair moisturized.) In teens, rising levels of male hormones, especially testosterone – present in males and females – are thought to trigger acne by creating a surplus of sebum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changes in the level of insulin, the hormone that clears sugar from the blood, can also increase the formation of acne.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The link between overweight and acne makes sense to researchers. Insulin and other hormones are often altered in overweight adolescents, increasing the likelihood of acne.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also possible that polycystic ovary syndrome could explain some of the findings. It's a hormonal problem that causes women to have symptoms such as irregular menstrual periods, obesity, acne and excess hair growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although diet contributes to weight gain, it's not clear from this particular study if specific foods are to blame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other studies have pinpointed certain foods, opposing the notion that diet has nothing to do with acne.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The role of diet in the development of acne wasn't always refuted. Prior to the 1960s, dietary advice was a standard part of acne therapy. At the time, elevated blood sugar and impaired carbohydrate metabolism was implicated in acne. Patients were told to avoid eating too much carbohydrate and too many sugary foods. Dermatology textbooks discouraged foods such as chocolate, sweets, fatty foods and carbonated beverages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After two studies were published in 1969 and 1971 – studies that wouldn't be published today – doctors abandoned the idea that diet and acne were related. Both studies, fraught with major design flaws, failed to find a link between acne and a handful of foods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, four decades later, researchers are re-examining the diet-acne connection and coming up with evidence that, for certain foods, there is a link.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there's isn't absolute proof the following dietary factors cause acne, some modifications may be worth considering. And many are all-round healthy suggestions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-glycemic foods</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most convincing evidence to date has identified high-glycemic index (GI) foods as an offender. High-GI foods such as white bread, white rice, refined breakfast cereals, cookies, cakes and sugary drinks cause spikes in insulin. This, in turn, limits the production of proteins that attach to testosterone, leaving the hormone free to roam the body and possibly cause acne.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a recent, well-controlled trial, males aged 15 to 25 who were assigned a low-GI diet experienced an improvement in acne, better insulin sensitivity and increases in testosterone-binding proteins in the blood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foods with a low-GI release sugar more slowly into the bloodstream and don't produce an outpouring of insulin. Examples include grainy breads with seeds, steel cut and large flake oats, 100-per-cent bran cereals, oat bran, brown rice, sweet potatoes, pasta, apples, citrus fruit, grapes, pears, legumes, nuts, yogurt and soy milk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dairy products</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two large studies conducted among nine- to 15-year-old children reported a significant association between milk and acne. Kids who drank two or more servings of milk each day were more likely to experience acne compared with those who consumed one or fewer servings a week. In boys, the link was strongest for skim milk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers speculate that certain components in milk – other than milk fat – may stimulate insulin and growth factors that increase testosterone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you do plan to cut back on dairy, get missing nutrients from elsewhere in the diet. Adolescents need 1,300 milligrams of calcium each day for bone health. Plain or unsweetened soy beverages, a good source of calcium and protein, can be substituted for milk. Other non-dairy calcium sources include cooked green vegetables, legumes, almonds, tofu and canned salmon with the bones. A daily calcium supplement may also be required.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Omega-3 fats</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's some evidence to suggest that increasing omega-3 fats may help lessen acne. These fats, plentiful in fatty fish, fish oil supplements and certain plant foods, have anti-inflammatory actions and have been shown to reduce levels of insulin growth factors and inflammation of skin follicles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fish rich in omega-3s include salmon, herring, mackerel, trout and sardines. Plant sources of omega-3 fats are flaxseed, flax oil, chia seeds, walnuts and soybeans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Body weight</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, three studies have linked a heavier body weight with a higher rate of acne, although not all of them found the association in both sexes. Regardless of the relationship between weight and acne, it's prudent to maintain a BMI between 18.5 and 25.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tonight, many a haggis will be piped in for the traditional Robbie Burns's celebration. But Scottish food is not all neeps and tatties and stuffed sheep stomach. Originally a peasant cuisine, it blossomed during the 16th century when Mary Queen of Scots returned from France to take up the Scottish throne. She brought her French chefs who improved all aspects of the food, especially the baking.</p>

However, we seldom ate out – Scots tended to eat at home and not in restaurants. Today that has all changed. Scottish chefs have developed the cuisine using the excellent products available as well as experimenting with different techniques and flavours. Their restaurants shine with accolades and stars.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEPPI'S PICKS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ghost of Scotland's national poet will haunt a man for not suggesting “Scotch drink” with this hearty spread. And whisky – ideally with a splash of water or two ice cubes – would not be out of place. The malty richness, fruity overtones and smoky aroma of a lightly peated Scotch touch all bases for a home run. But if strong spirit seems too jarring, consider a malty Scottish brew, such as the excellent, moderately bitter Caledonia 80 or an oak-aged bottling from Innis &amp; Gunn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prefer wine? On the white side, an oaked chardonnay works for both the chowder and the mince, especially if the mince sits on a buttery mash. Red-wise, consider a syrah-based cuvée from southern France. The bread pudding would be splendid with sweet sherry, but I suspect Burns would have recommended an auld whisky.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Dalton McGuinty's speech to the Canadian Club on Tuesday laid some emphasis on the need to reduce Ontario's $16-billion deficit, but it lacked any specifics that would warrant confidence that the provincial government will seriously restrain spending, in particular on public-sector wages and salaries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McGuinty's speech was presented as an important one, but it is hard to see why. More than a quarter-year has passed since the Liberal government was re-elected. There has been a fiscal update, in which the two major changes on the spending side came from the good luck of lower than expected interest expense and, less happily, the eating away of $308-million in the province's contingency funds. The public will not be any the wiser on the Liberals' plans until Dwight Duncan, the Finance Minister, presents his budget in March.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“One half of all government spending – about $55-billion – is invested in wages and salaries,” said the Premier. The word “invested” erroneously suggests that public-sector pay amounts to capital formation, rather than to recurring expense – an unsettling fallacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, Mr. McGuinty said that spending cannot be reduced “without addressing salary expenditures.” The verb “address” here may mean “lessen,” yet it could also mean only a slowing of the rate of increase. The Premier promised respect for collective bargaining, which is fair enough, but he declined to elaborate on how strenuously the government would negotiate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In answering questions, Mr. McGuinty alluded to what he might say “when I go to my doctors, my nurses ….” The favourable interpretation of his message is that he is telling workers in the broad public sector to brace themselves for some disappointments. The worrying interpretation is that his minority government will keep counting on the support of the NDP, a party whose base consists of public-sector employees – and will not do enough to cut spending.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the third of a four-part series on innovative ways to deliver aid in our conflicted world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every economic slump ushers in predictable, if not propagandistic, debates about Official Development Assistance, otherwise known as foreign aid. While Stephen Harper's government has frozen aid spending through to 2015, the real anti-aid evangelicals can be found to the south, at the Republican primaries. Ron Paul, whose greatest accomplishment is that the press is still willing to hand him a microphone, has pledged to cancel American foreign aid altogether. There are, therefore, compelling reasons to consider where aid is now and where it might be headed.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recession has been brutal to those who are reliant on humanitarian assistance for their very survival. European governments have, not surprisingly, made drastic cuts to their aid spending. So has the U.S. Congress, and many foundations are operating on reduced budgets. The effect has been that non-governmental organizations around the world are swimming in a rapidly evaporating pool of funding, raising the competitive stakes alongside a host of ethical questions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On this point, several of the world's leading international charities are now keeping some rather curious company, which could either represent the future of aid – a progressive merger of economic interests and social development – or its fire sale. One month ago, the Canadian International Development Agency announced a controversial multimillion-dollar grant to three leading international charities who will partner with major Canadian mining firms on development initiatives in African and Latin American countries in which these companies operate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the deal, World University Services Canada, Plan Canada and World Vision Canada will receive CIDA funding totalling $6.7-million for projects with <span class="companylink">Rio Tinto Alcan</span>, Iamgold and Barrick Gold, respectively. The largest share was for the Plan Canada-Iamgold project, which will take all but $1-million of the CIDA funding over the next five years. For their part, the three mining companies will contribute additional support just shy of $2-million. The combined annual net profit for these firms is in the billions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, on any given day that CIDA makes a funding announcement, the sanctimony served up by those who were overlooked is best cut with the knives sticking out of the backs of those who emerged as big winners. But this one struck at the very heart of the NGO community, leading many to ask of their colleagues, “How could you?” Two of the participating mining firms have recently been involved in labour and human-rights disputes related to operations abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central tension is whether these NGOs are serving as bagmen, advancing Canadian mining interests with taxpayer funding by appeasing local communities with gifts of health care and education, or whether they are simply piloting a new model of co-operation that might positively influence corporate behaviour overseas while simultaneously addressing development gaps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly the latter is what the executive director of WUSC, Chris Eaton, is hoping for. He was quoted in The Dominion newspaper expressing his sincere desire that such partnerships will “nudge along good practice.” Perhaps, but they can also buy silence in the case of bad practice, which is inherently more dangerous. And why would CIDA pick up any of the tab to improve the reputation of Canada's mining sector abroad, if not to cement Mr. Harper's vision for an aid policy that serves Canada's trade and economic interests first, officially clearing the belfry of all Pearsonian bats?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to the new humanitarianism, where government funding is scarce, traditional donors are aging and more organizations are turning to corporate alliances that would once have been viewed as heresy. Yet as the aid sector goes in search of new funding models, we might do well to remember a line from the 17th-century English poet John Dryden: “Better shun the bait than struggle in the snare.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robbie Burns and Scotch whisky – they go together like haggis and squeamish stomachs. The grand poet loved the spirit, and the spirit paid him in return, lubricating his quill with inspiration.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet there's a wee irony in the association of those twin pillars of Scottish culture today. A tenant farmer and champion of the underclasses, Mr. Burns – celebrated tonight in memorial suppers around the globe – curiously became a proletarian hero in Russia and China. In Russia, he was dubbed the “people's poet” and was lionized with a Soviet postage stamp in 1956.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Scotch industry is celebrating its best run ever thanks to growing demand for Western luxury goods, not least among the newly minted rich in Russia and Asia. Exports during the first half of 2011 grew by 22 per cent in value to a record $2.8-billion (equivalent to 569 million bottles), defying the general economic malaise. During the same time period, exports to Asia increased 33 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spirit today bears scant resemblance to the mostly raw fare of Mr. Burns's 18th century. I wonder what would the egalitarian bard make of it all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though robust single malts, distilled entirely from barley and containing spirits made by a single distillery, get most of the glory, the Scotch market is vibrant at all levels. Exports of smoother blended whiskies, which usually combine lighter-tasting corn and wheat spirits with an assemblage of single malts, grew by 5 per cent in value in 2010 over 2009. Blends, including such familiar names as Johnnie Walker, Chivas Regal, Grant's and Dewar's, still make up roughly 75 per cent of sales by value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many blending houses have been moving upmarket, too, crafting such brand extensions as the excellent Black Grouse from the Famous Grouse and Cutty Black from Cutty Sark, which incorporate smoky nuances of peat, the earthy fuel source used to dry barley in most single malts. Some also contain fruity richness imparted by casks that once held sherry. Independent bottlers, who typically buy aged whisky stocks from distilleries to create their own blends, are pushing the innovation envelope. One Florida-based company called Scottish Spirits has even released – wait for it – Scotch in soda-pop-sized, unresealable cans, ideal, it says, for camping and tailgate parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You don't need a Burns supper to enjoy the selections below. Try them any time, preferably straight up with a small splash of water to lift the aroma (three parts whisky to one part water is usually nice). I think Mr. Burns would have approved.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most smoky Scotches get their chimney charm from peat-fuelled fires used in drying damp barley malt. This limited-edition bottling owes its smoke to contact with casks that once held peated whisky. The unconventional technique has a peculiar yet compelling effect. There's barely a peaty waft on the nose, yet the sooty essence comes through boldly on the palate, harmonizing well with Balvenie's signature rich maltiness and honey as well as with sweet tinned fruit. Once current shipments run out, there will be no more of this unusual elixir. ($162.90 in Nfld., $162.50 in B.C.)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mexico has been making headlines a lot lately for the wrong reasons. This holiday season is passing with the news of three Canadians (one of them Mexican-born) killed there and this has been exacerbated this week by an attack on a woman in a luxury resort in the seaside town of Mazatlan. Understandably, some Canadians are wondering whether it is safe to travel to Mexico under these circumstances.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The evidence seems to point to the fact that more tourists have recently become targets for attacks, stray bullets and horrible murders, thus it becomes reasonable to think that travel to Mexico should be avoided. Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada recommends through its travel advisory to “exercise a high degree of caution” when travelling there. So, should Canadians be staying away?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every year, according to the Mexican Secretary of Tourism, close to two million Canadians travel south to enjoy Mexico's sun, food and beaches. Tourism is one of Mexico's main sources of income, surpassed only by oil revenues and remittances. Clearly, it is a very important industry that, under regular circumstances, results in a win-win situation for everyone: Tourists escape the winter freeze while spending money that benefits the Mexican economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, however, the situation is much more complicated. The Mexican government is engaged in a war with the country's drug cartels, which are also fighting each other, resulting in a significant increase in violence that fills national and international news space. The death toll, last we checked, rested at about 50,000 since 2006. Unfortunately, along with the terrible loss of life, Mexico is trading its image as a peaceful place to visit for that of a dangerous and violent destination overrun by organized crime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As portrayed by the media, Mexico has become much more violent in the last six years, and this is highly related to the drug trade. And yes, some of this violence has affected tourist destinations. However, this last point is not a general trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the latest Mexican government report, close to 80 per cent of all homicides related to organized crime in Mexico take place in 162 municipalities – out of a total of 2,456 – meaning that most of Mexico actually retains a lower homicide rate that most other countries in the Latin American region. Mexico City has an intentional homicide rate of 9 per 100,000 inhabitants, equal to that of Miami Beach, Fla. That's a bit over twice the rate of Thunder Bay, which leads Canada with 4.7 per 100,000 inhabitants. But Thunder Bay's rate is more than twice that of the state of Yucatan, in southern Mexico, where the rate is 2 per 100,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should you go to Mexico? The answer is ultimately a personal one. Without denying Mexico's serious violence problem, painting Mexico as a completely unsafe place is not realistic. Unfortunately, tourists will sometimes be victims of crime, and not just in Mexico. Risks will always exist and care should be taken when travelling, whether it's to Mazatlan, Miami Beach or Thunder Bay.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dalton McGuinty has spent so much time setting the table, he could give lessons to a busboy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was hope, in some quarters, that the Ontario Premier would use his Tuesday address to the Canadian Club to finally begin spelling out his plan to get the province's finances onto a stable footing. Instead, Mr. McGuinty yet again served notice that tough decisions will need to be made, without shedding much light on what those decisions will be.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The closest the speech came to making news was a goes-without-saying warning to public-sector unions that wage restraint will be an aim of coming contract negotiations. Otherwise, there was a reiteration of the goal to eliminate the $16-billion deficit by 2017-18, a recognition that doing so is key to Ontario's economic prospects, and a promise to be neither “rash” nor “timid” along the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it fell short of what seemed, based on how Liberals have been talking lately, to be one of its key goals: wresting control of the provincial agenda back from Don Drummond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last spring's appointment of the former bank economist to review the province's public services was a political masterstroke, allowing the Liberals to push the heavy lifting until after the fall election. But the Liberals didn't fully consider what they were getting themselves into, and many of them are now grumbling about Mr. Drummond's commission having taken on a life of its own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although his report won't be released before mid-February, Mr. Drummond has managed to dominate the provincial news cycle by using interviews to slowly roll out his key findings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Drummond's growing legend, to which Mr. McGuinty made light-hearted reference at the start of Tuesday's speech, can be chalked up partly to his adeptness at self-promotion. But if the Liberals are chafing, they also have themselves to blame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three-and-a-half months have passed since the election, and the government still hasn't announced a single major policy aimed at the financial challenges largely ignored during the campaign. So Mr. Drummond has stepped into the void, and in the process created the impression that he's effectively writing the next budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that's not true, and the Liberals insist it isn't, then it needs to be quickly disproven – if not for the sake of a confused public, then for markets and credit agencies, one of which recently warned Ontario of a potential downgrade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's one thing, perception-wise, for the government to cherry-pick from a commissioned report as it implements its own plan. It's another for that report to be the only discernible plan, and for the government to reject large elements of it. Even if the Liberals were subsequently to unveil their own alternatives to Mr. Drummond's proposals, they would have to be pretty bold to avoid the perception that they simply didn't have the stomachs to implement what their own “austerity guru” had recommended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most intriguing line in Mr. McGuinty's speech on Tuesday was that Health Minister Deb Matthews will “shortly” present an “exciting plan for health-care transformation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Considering that health expenditures are approaching 50 per cent of provincial program spending that gives the government one more chance to get ahead of the game. Or it could just be one more chance to set the table.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VANCOUVER -- “The issue of affordability in my mind is one that is front and centre,” Transportation Minister Blair Lekstrom says after release of an independent review of <span class="companylink">BC Ferries</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BC Ferries commissioner Gord Macatee has called for a major overhaul in a review of ferry operations released earlier this week. He urged the B.C. government to abandon its commitment to a user pay system and drop its opposition to major routes subsidizing the less-travelled ones. He recommended that fares be capped at the rate of inflation over the next three years.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His proposals would require a significant shift in ideology for the B.C. Liberal government. Accepting the recommendations could lead to substantial government subsidies. The Liberals would be reversing what they have done over the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. Transportation Minister Blair Lekstrom has not yet shown his cards. In carefully measured comments, he identified affordability as a top item for him. But so far, he has avoided a firm position. New rates are expected to come into effect in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Macatee's report shows that former ferries chief David Hahn clearly achieved what he was hired to do before he retired from the corporation after controversy over his $1-million compensation package and generous pension.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">BC Ferries</span> had been a Crown corporation dependent on government subsidies and subject to political interference by those who sent the cheques. However, as Mr. Macatee noted, the ferry system now covers 100 per cent of its operating costs from fares and ancillary revenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's no secret how the ferry corporation accomplished that, especially especially to the passengers who take the ferries each year. Fares since 2003 have gone up 47 per cent on the major routes, 78 per cent in the north and 80 per cent on minor routes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, while fares were rising, traffic volumes were dropping. Mr. Macatee found that current fares impose “significant hardship” on ferry-dependent communities and were affecting the ability of people to visit family members and friends as frequently as they would like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lindsay Meredith, a marketing professor at Simon Fraser University, said the Liberal government “ran into Economics 101.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's basic, fundamental, down-and-dirty, easy-as-it-gets demand and supply. … Jack up your price and watch your demand plummet,” he said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confronted by cranky islanders opposed to the recent hefty fare hikes, the Liberals face a fundamental dilemma: Does the government continue to consider <span class="companylink">BC Ferries</span> a private corporation subject to the full laws of market demand and supply, or is it prepared to regard the ferries as an extension of the highway system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a tough decision,” Prof. Meredith said, adding that the right-wing-oriented government has always voiced the mantra that the business sector and private capital markets can do it best. But if the Liberals start increasing subsidies to keep fares down, they will be saying, “No, they can't,” Prof. Meredith said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North Coast MLA Gary Coons, the NDP critic for issues related to <span class="companylink">BC Ferries</span>, said an NDP government would bring the ferries corporation back under the provincial highways department. He endorsed a recommendation to shuffle the priorities of the <span class="companylink">BC Ferry</span> commissioner, who is required to set ferry prices once every four years. Protecting the interest of ferry users should take priority over ensuring the financial sustainability of a company that has a monopoly, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the government's decision is based solely on affordability for ferry users, the verdict is obvious. The tougher question for Mr. Lekstrom and his colleagues may be whether the Liberals can afford to undo what they have created at <span class="companylink">BC Ferries</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the days leading up to the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> all-star game last year, the first time the players were chosen in fantasy draft fashion, there was much hand-wringing over who might be picked last – and how that snub might affect his all-star experience.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Phil Kessel of the Toronto Maple Leafs was picked last. For the dubious distinction, he received a car and a donation to his favourite charity. Now, suddenly, there is no stigma attached to being last – and maybe even a little cachet. Last weekend, Detroit Red Wings star Pavel Datsyuk, who could be the best player in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> right now, ventured it would be okay with him if he were the last man sitting, as long as there was a shiny new vehicle waiting at the end of the auditorium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sorry Pavel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa Senators veteran Daniel Alfredsson, along with former teammate Zdeno Chara, is in charge of picking the teams Thursday, as all-star festivities get under way in Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if Alfredsson is not tipping his hand about strategy, one thing's for sure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Datsyuk's not going to be last,” Alfredsson said. “I can guarantee you that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is all a new experience for Alfredsson, who wasn't paying close attention last year when his old friend, Nicklas Lidstrom of the Red Wings, along with the hometown all-star Eric Staal of the Carolina Hurricanes, were the two captains involved in the first fantasy draft, which created enough of a sensation that the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> brought it back again this year. Once Alfredsson was chosen as captain, he went onto the Internet to research how it unfolded, what to expect, and how to prepare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I read how Lidstrom was going to talk to [Red Wings general manager] Kenny Holland and get some input,” Alfredsson said. “It's nice to have some assistants, too – I know Henrik [Lundqvist, the New York Rangers' goalie] is going to be on my side, and that's going to help a lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But I think it's a good thing. I think it's going to be a lot of fun, and it brings a little more competitiveness to the whole thing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the favourite fantasy-draft threads last year was what to do with the Sedin twins, Henrik and Daniel, who have played together their entire careers. Most wanted to see them separated, just to see how that would work, and both Sedins were good sports when it actually happened, engaging in a little bit of manufactured trash talk, drummed up by TSN host James Duthie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sedins will be a focal point again this year because of the Vancouver Canucks' current red-hot rivalry with the Boston Bruins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would Chara, the Bruins' captain, ever pick a Sedin for his team? Would Alfredsson, a fellow Swede and a fellow Olympian, ever permit a Sedin to go to the opposition? We'll see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some ways, the draft last year was the highlight of the all-star proceedings, exceeding the game, the skills competition, and all the off-ice chatter for drama and thrills. In a year, 2012, when no-shows and injury withdrawals will have a whole lot of first-year all-stars in place, it may happen that way again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One player who likely won't last until the end either is Jason Spezza, Alfredsson's teammate. Last year, Staal went heavy on the hometown choices when the game was in Raleigh, picking his brother, Marc, early as well as his Hurricanes teammate Cam Ward. So no car probably for Spezza, if Alfredsson does the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Everybody says they want that [to be last] now,” Spezza said. “I think the first time it was a shock; now it's on everybody's mind. But I think it's a fun thing, too, and it's something the fans have really taken to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As players, it's something you shrug off. You're in the all-star game. You're having a pretty good year, so I don't think you should worry about who's picked last and who isn't. Everybody's a pretty good player here.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And just for that reason, Alfredsson isn't worried about hurting anybody's feelings, no matter who ends up sitting there alone, at the end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Everybody knows what's going on and somebody has to be last,” Alfredsson said. “Usually what happens is, it's going to be one of the younger guys. That's just the way it is. I don't feel bad. It has to be somebody.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has to be somebody, even if it won't be that Russian fellow from Detroit. Chances are pretty good that Datsyuk will the first man standing, not the last one sitting.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leveraging is an investment industry term that is best defined as borrowing trouble.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technically, it means taking a loan out to invest in stocks or funds. The more you invest with borrowed money as opposed to your own, the larger the profit you can “leverage.” Losses are also magnified, which is why leveraging is a strategy to avoid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warning: Leveraging proponents, and there are many in the financial industry, can be persuasive. If you're cornered by one, just say your life is exciting enough without watching stocks or funds you bought with borrowed money plunge in value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leveraging can be fairly described as a way of building wealth, which means it's a better kind of debt than borrowing for transitory things, such as trips, or depreciating assets, such as cars. Rather than investing bit by bit, leveraging allows you to put a big chunk of money to work immediately. Studies show this can achieve better results than gradual investing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, repaying the investment loan imposes financial discipline. You may balk at investing in uncertain times, but you have to make your regular investment loan payments. At today's low interest rates, your cost of borrowing is nominal. And, when you borrow to invest in a non-registered account, the interest on the loan is tax deductible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investing industry consultant Talbot Stevens has for years worked with advisers to develop guidelines on how to make leveraging work for investors. But even he acknowledges that what works on paper often doesn't play well in an investing world where the risk of double-digit losses is omnipresent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors, he says, are too prone to selling when their leveraged investments have fallen in value, thereby locking in potentially nasty losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Behaviour trumps math 9.9 times out of 10,” Mr. Stevens said. “Our reptilian brain kicks in before our mammalian brain gets a chance to analyze things. We get scared, we hit the panic button and sell. It's fear and greed, magnified.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the investing industry, leveraging is a slam-dunk winning strategy for turning small accounts into big ones that generate more fees and commission. Expect to see lots of hype about RRSP loans now that registered retirement savings plan season is under way. Although not a classic leveraging situation, RRSP loans are still borrowing to invest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just this week, the Ontario Securities Commission issued a note to investors about the risks of leveraged investing. Two key points: Leveraging increases your investing risk; and you're on the hook to pay off your loan even if your investments tank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can see the need for such warnings in the rising number of complaints about leveraging. The Ombudsman for Banking Services and Investments received 30 complaints on this issue in the 12 months to Oct. 31, compared with 16 in fiscal 2010 and 12 in the previous year. Six complaints have been submitted in the first two months of fiscal 2012, which suggests unhappiness is growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last fall, the Canadian Foundation for Advancement of Investor Rights (FAIR Canada) sent a letter to provincial securities regulators suggesting there be a presumption that leveraging is unsuitable for retail investors. The onus would then be on the person recommending the leverage to prove it's an appropriate strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We don't think most investors adequately understand the downside risks,” said Marian Passmore, associate director at FAIR. “It's easy to get sold [on leveraging] without truly understanding what you're doing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That point is backed up by the experience of Ottawa lawyers John Hollander and Harold Geller, who say leverage issues account for about half of their investor complaint cases: The client didn't understand how much he or she could lose in a down market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Over and over, we're hearing clients say ‘we did not know,' ” Mr. Hollander said. “If one [client] said it, I'd say, okay, that's pretty self-serving. You were told there could be a hit and you didn't want to take it. But they all say it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A powerful example of successful leveraging is the $250,000 investment loan that financial adviser Andrew Guilfoyle took out for himself in December, 2008, when the Canadian stock market was about 35-per-cent lower than it is now (read the details online at tgam.ca/is5).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Guilfoyle is no leveraging booster, though. He argues that, while an investment loan might conceivably pay off over a long period, short-term market turbulence will overwhelm many people, causing them to sell at a loss.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From British Columbia, the view of the Crown/first nations gathering is decidedly different.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent history suggests that talk in Ottawa this week about the need to escape the shackles of the Indian Act is mostly just that. Attempts by the B.C. and federal governments to conclude treaty negotiations with the province's first nations have been a dismal failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 20 years, only three groups have signed deals paving their way to independence. There are other deals in the pipe, we're told, but otherwise, a bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The head of the B.C. Treaty Commission, Sophie Pierre, made headlines last fall when she said the process should be shut down unless more progress is made soon. This, of course, runs counter to what we heard out of Ottawa, where many native leaders lamented the continued tyranny of the Indian Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many reasons why B.C. first nations have been reluctant to cut the apron strings with Ottawa. Some don't like the terms they're being offered. Some are not yet ready to set sail on their own. Some feel that recent moves by the federal government have profoundly changed the self-government game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, two pieces of federal legislation passed in the last six years have altered the aboriginal landscape more than most know.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The First Nations Commercial and Industrial Development Act (2005) and the First Nations Certainty of Land Title Act (2010) have helped unlock enormous economic potential for aboriginal groups, especially in urban areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Together, the legislation allows native groups to develop their land in ways previously not possible. Among other things, the bills give real-estate projects on reserves the same legal protections as those off reserve. The land title act allows bands to transfer property rights to non-aboriginals, making development more attractive to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, the bills free first nations groups from some of the most stifling provisions of the Indian Act and gives them control over their future in a way they didn't have before. But there is an unintended consequence: There is less incentive now for aboriginal groups to sign treaties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there is much about the Indian Act that native groups abhor, it does assure them of two things they don't mind at all: tax-free status and a pipeline of money from Ottawa. After a native group signs a treaty, those benefits get phased out. The whole point of self-government, after all, is to give aboriginal communities the clout and ability to stand on their own, free of an act native leaders have called oppressive and paternalistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many bands have come to depend on their tax-free status and federal funding. With these fresh economic opportunities, many first nations can now earn heaps of money and keep their federal benefits too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not a knock against aboriginal leaders thinking along these lines. They have politics and elections and the majority's will to consider. Many band members don't want to lose the sure thing they have now. And if they can have their cake and eat it too, why wouldn't they?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, not all of Canada's Indian bands will be able to take advantage of the new legislation, especially in remote areas. And so long as such groups remain under the Indian Act, they lack property rights. So current arrangements are far from perfect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To that extent, aboriginal politics in Canada remain as complex as ever. And the pathway to a brighter future is equally elusive.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DAVOS, SWITZERLAND -- Professor of European studies at Oxford University</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Angela Merkel came to Davos on Wednesday and, in a speech as solidly built as a Mercedes, once again assured the world's business leaders that the euro will be saved. But this time, there's a difference: More of them seem to believe it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That immediately raises two further questions: Even if the euro zone is saved, where is the strategy for growth? And where would this saving of the euro leave the larger politics of Europe?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the euro, I find a noticeable shift in mood. Six months ago, business and political leaders were not convinced that Europe in general, and Germany in particular, would do what it takes. A gradual accumulation of piecemeal, pragmatic steps – very much in Ms. Merkel's style – has changed the balance of sentiment. There is the decision to accelerate the introduction of the European Stability Mechanism this summer, following hard on the heels of the existing European Financial Stability Facility. There is the very active role of the IMF, another indirect way for European governments to help out (and impose conditions on) other European governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are the two Marios. I recently heard one leading banker describe Mario Draghi's initiative to give generous three-year loans from the European Central Bank to European banks as the European form of quantitative easing. Mario Monti's professorial program for Italy has also earned plaudits. This is not an American- or Chinese-style big bazooka; the European version of a big bazooka is an array of small- to medium-sized bazookas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mood may swing again, even in the next few days, if the apparent impasse over Greek debt is not resolved. But one increasingly hears Greece discounted as a special case. In case of a Greek default, the euro zone would have to move very fast to show it would not let Portugal go the same way. But that could also prove a positive turning point. A line would be drawn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assume, for the sake of argument, that over the next six months, the euro zone is saved. Two problems arise. The first: Where is growth to come from? The German austerity recipe provides no clear answer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless Europe has a growth strategy, it is in danger of falling into a deflationary debt spiral, as George Soros warned Wednesday. If economies contract and tax revenues fall, the debt burden – the ratio of accumulated debt to GDP – would actually increase. Earlier this week, the IMF came out with a revised forecast, predicting a contraction of the euro zone economy by 0.5 per cent in 2012 – with, needless to say, some countries doing much worse than others, and Britain being pulled down with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That takes us to the politics. If markets are about perceptions and emotions, so are democracies. If the former are about those of the few, the latter are about those of the many. And the feelings in Europe are very bad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Read the newspapers, watch television, check out the opinion polls, listen to debates in national parliaments, watch the demos in the streets: You will find little of what Ms. Merkel called Wednesday “the happiness of being able to shape things together.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are massive resentments between nations – Greeks against Germans and Germans against Greeks; northern against southern Europeans; Brits against almost everybody; almost everybody against Brits. There is a general crisis of confidence in the European project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we are witnessing the euro being saved, this is a triumph of fear, not of hope. Other great moments of the European project – the introduction of the single market, successive enlargements, the launch of the euro itself – were driven by hope. Here, it is fear that has led Germany and others to do the minimum necessary: fear that the costs of collapse would be higher than the unpalatable, resented alternative of bailing out those in trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the euro zone does not return to growth, or does so only in a few better-placed countries, these resentments will multiply. Even if it does, there will be legacies of bitterness. More and more people will ask, “What is this Europe really for?” (Remember that the European monetary union was conceived of not just as an economic step but also, perhaps even more so, as a political one.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are good answers to this question, and they urgently need to be spelled out. They have to do with our negotiating power in the 21st century world of emerging, non-Western giants such as China and India; global challenges like climate change; the Arab spring, the most hopeful development of this decade; and defending (with the help of essential, managed immigration from the Arab world) the domestic achievements of the last half-century, including a certain European mix of relative prosperity, quality of life, social justice and security.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be foolish to pretend that the euro has been the best and straightest path to those larger goals. If the euro did not exist, it would not yet be necessary to introduce it. But it does exist, with all the design faults that have now become evident. We have to start from where we are. To go back now would be worse than to go forward. Difficult though it will be, Europeans have to correct those design faults as they go along, working within the necessary constraints of national democracies, and adding a strategy for growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Above all, we have to recognize that saving the euro is no substitute for the larger political project, of which it was once meant to be both core and catalyst. The politics of fear may have saved the euro. We need a politics of hope to find a European answer to the Arab Spring.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My college roommate got engaged this summer. She's having a small wedding at a rustic resort here in Alberta. I think I'm one of the only people invited that who isn't family. I'm not really close to her any more, we don't have the same friends or see each other that often. I've met her fiancé less than a dozen times. I don't want to go to the wedding. It would be awkward and, to be honest, expensive. My better half is unimpressed because the hotel does not have Internet, TV or even phones in the rooms. It's not pet friendly and I have no idea how the kids would be entertained for two days. I want to bail with every ounce of my being. How do I handle this? Buck it up or bolt?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I believe the expression is either “buck up” or “suck it up,” but yeah, do that one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I could cite any number of reasons why you ought to go to the wedding, why it's “the right thing to do.” (TM)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do it for old times' sake; to support a friend; to support the institution of marriage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Damage Control's central tenets is “always go to the funeral.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not my original thought. Plagiarism's an ugly term – let's call it an “homage” to a National Public Radio essay by a woman named Deirdre Sullivan, whose father would say: “You can't come in without going out, kids. Always go to the funeral.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over time, she came to interpret her dad's dictum more broadly. It came to mean, “that I have to do the right thing when I really, really don't feel like it. … I'm talking about those things that represent only inconvenience to me, but the world to the other guy. You know, the painfully under-attended birthday party. The hospital visit during happy hour. … In my … life, the daily battle hasn't been good versus evil. It's hardly so epic. Most days, my real battle is doing good versus doing nothing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think the same principle more or less applies with weddings. Maybe you don't always “have” to go. But if someone has done you the honour of extending an invitation, you ought to try to make it – barring some more strenuous objection than lack of Internet access (get one of those little sticks), lack of phones (there's a new invention called the “cellular phone”), the expense, bored kids, or – what was the other thing, again? The “pet-friendliness” of the hotel?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why, because you want to bring Snuggles the cat to the wedding?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if it's an inconvenience for you, your attendance could well mean the world to her. A wedding is a sacred ceremony, the union of two people and so forth. You'll be a “witness.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But apart from everything else, weddings are fun! I don't know how you like to party out West, but to me it seems like a great opportunity to fill your 10-gallon hat with ribs and one of your boots with champagne and shake your money-maker until the cows need milking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Here in the East, we fill our fedoras with sushi and sip Prosecco from our penny loafers and say stuff like, “How did you enjoy the Verdi last night?”)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's another thought: If it's expensive, and your better half is “unimpressed,” why not go by yourself?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He sounds like a bit of a pain/pill/buzzkill, anyway. I don't know, maybe it's just the wording you used but … why does he need to be “impressed” by your old roommate's wedding? He was invited: He should be grateful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe you leaving him with the kids and the animals and the dishes and all the rest will be good for him. “Absence makes the heart grow fonder,” and all that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either way, this wedding could be good for your relationship – as is so often the case. Say you go together. Weddings tend to have a (gin and) tonic effect on couples – they bring you back, as the getting-married couple exchanges vows, you glance slyly at one another, remember when you were just starting out, and so forth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there's the reception. I don't think I've ever been to a wedding reception that wasn't fun. Free food, booze and dancing, what's not to like?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For these reasons (and others too numerous to mention), weddings are not only hotbeds for single people to hook up, they're festivals of rekindling for established couples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, hmm, how shall I put this? Maybe after the two of you spend the evening drinking, strolling down memory lane and “cutting a rug” together, back in the hotel room Internet access and pet-friendliness might be the last things on your mind, wink, wink. (For God's sake if you do go together, leave the kids and pets at home.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So whether you bring Mr. Unimpressed Better Half or not, I say: Yes, suck it up, put on your dancing shoes/drinking boots, hop in the car, get your buns to the church or whatever, and party like it's 1999.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the last in a four-part series on innovative ways to deliver aid in our conflicted world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aid is ineffective. By some estimates, more than $2-trillion has been spent fighting poverty since the 1950s, with little direct impact. The stories of failure are illustrated with hydro dams that never worked, crops that never grew and roads that went nowhere.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entrepreneurs, however, are changing the world. Since 2005, an estimated half-billion people or more have been raised out of poverty, mainly by small business, trade liberalization and gains in productivity. In China, Pakistan, Indonesia and Nigeria, booming local economies, oblivious to the latest schemes of aid programs, are creating millions of jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Brookings Institution recently predicted even more dramatic gains ahead: “Between 2005 and 2015, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Ethiopia are each expected to grow by at least 6.3 per cent per year, and in the process, each is likely to see a quarter of its population lifted out of poverty.” Entrepreneurs, not aid spending, are driving this growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The innovation that led to this dramatic advance in the fight against global poverty was the grudging realization by donors that aid planners do not create jobs – small business does.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I personally saw this when I worked for the United Nations in East Timor. I was charged with creating an “economic security” policy and I failed, spectacularly. Although our aid budget was larger than the entire Timorese economy, unemployment was over 50 per cent and poverty levels were the worst in Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I found hope in the front yard of my rented house. There, day by day, my Timorese landlord, Senhor Antoni, patiently rebuilt a burned-out bus. He used my rent cheques to buy parts and hire local boys as mechanics and drivers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senhor Antoni soon became the biggest employer in the neighbourhood, and had a small fleet providing transport services across the entire country. Meanwhile, our massive aid program continued to wallow ineffectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That experience taught me that the most powerful force for poverty reduction is not development assistance – it's local entrepreneurs. When they are given an opportunity to compete, they can transform even the poorest country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donors have slowly arrived at a similar conclusion. While once the private sector was seen as a necessary evil, now it is recognized as the main means of sustainable economic growth. Increasingly, aid agencies are funding mechanisms to make markets more efficient, to connect local exporters to global buyers, and to provide finance to small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An important factor that supported this innovation was the rejection of “tied aid.” Traditionally, government donors required that money for overseas assistance had to be spent on domestic firms. For example, when Canada gave food to Ethiopia, it bought it from Canadian farmers. It was an ineffective means of subsidizing domestic farmers, it flooded Africa with underpriced grain and it inhibited the development of an African agricultural market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada has led international donors on changing this, for which CIDA and the Conservative government rarely get credit. Canada announced that it would untie food aid in 2008 and is set to untie all aid by 2013. This allows Canada to procure its development assistance from local entrepreneurs and to spend its development dollar twice. For example, if CIDA spends $1-million building a school in Afghanistan by using a local construction firm instead of one from Montreal, it leaves behind not only a school, but also $1-million in wages and taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sooner than we realize, the future of aid will be no aid. Other than urgent humanitarian assistance, donors will no longer be needed or wanted, as entrepreneurs in such countries as Liberia and Haiti create what donors cannot: prosperity.</p>

The event left Ms. Nabb so disfigured she will require facial reconstruction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This story received heightened publicity not only because of the assault's horrific quality, but because all incidents of violence against Canadians in Mexico are covered extensively.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This fact alone, however, does not make the country more dangerous than other popular sunny destinations – or indeed other parts of the world. The odds of Canadian visitors to Mexico being assaulted or killed are about 2.1 per 100,000, based on data from 2005-2009. That is lower than in Jamaica (3.6 per 100,000), India (7.5 per 100,000), South Africa (5 per 100,000) and Russia (3.2). It is slightly higher than Cuba (1.5 per 100,000) and the Dominican Republic (1.6).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Context is important, and there is no doubt that Mexico has a growing problem with violence, fuelled by the assault on the drug cartels launched by President Felipe Calderon in 2006. Homicide rates have increased as drug cartels battle one another to control the lucrative distribution networks to the U.S. market. But much of this violence is localized. Almost 80 per cent of all homicides connected to organized crime took place in just 6 per cent of the country's municipalities, according to the government's latest information, and most victims are Mexicans associated with crime. Many parts of Mexico – Yucatan, southern Baja California and Quintana Roo – remain untouched by the drug war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No wonder Canadians continue to travel to Mexico in enormous numbers – 1.6 million last year – attracted by the all-inclusive resorts, pristine beaches and pre-Hispanic ruins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few unlucky travellers will still be victims of crime, as happened to a man from British Columbia who was hit by a stray bullet in Mazatlan over the New Year, or of accidents such as last year's gas explosion at a hotel in Playa del Carmen, which left five Canadians dead. When such terrible events occur, Canadians may be disappointed to find that police and other agencies aren't always as professional and efficient as their counterparts back home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this doesn't change the reality that the odds of being assaulted or killed in Mexico are still relatively low, and that drug traffickers are not interested in tourists – except as paying customers.</p>

She is, after all, a victim, too. And she needs a divorce to move on with her life. There's a public interest in allowing that to happen. Indeed, a judge had granted her a publication ban to protect her from publicity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ontario's highest court threw out that ban – not because it thinks press freedom is more important than personal autonomy, but because it insisted on rigorous scrutiny of claims that a publication ban is necessary. The Ontario Court of Appeal demanded not just speculation but real evidence that Mr. Williams's wife would suffer serious emotional harm. And the evidence fell short.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too often, trial judges have said, with apparent sincerity, that publicity is the soul of justice – and then imposed a publication ban based on speculative harm. But the appeal court was unimpressed by evidence from the woman's psychiatrist, partly because he made assumptions about what had been in the media about her (he hadn't followed the coverage), and about future media harassment if information from the divorce proceedings was public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Openness helps ensure that divorce proceedings are conducted with fairness. In this case, media organizations have expressed interest in how Mr. Williams's military pension will be divided. It would have been easy, the court suggested, to shrug off the harm to the principle of openness: “A court faced with a case like this one where decency suggests some kind of protection . . . must avoid the temptation to begin by asking: where is the harm in allowing the respondent to proceed with some degree of anonymity and without her personal information being available to the media?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The constitutional stakes are high in press-freedom cases, the appeal court said, and it makes little sense to impose publication bans based on speculation about the harm of publicity.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A trade deal with Europe, now close, will change the way Ottawa and the provinces do business abroad. It will create a new level of free trading within Canada. It might also lead to an expensive, litigious mess.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The talks for a Canada-European Union trade agreement are close to an end now, and the deal should be done within weeks or a few months, according to people on both sides. Next week, EU officials arrive to clear away remaining disagreements after the nine rounds of negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This transatlantic deal has always revolved around the provinces. Quebec Premier Jean Charest was the instigator. For the EU, the prize was access to provincial and municipal contracts, so their companies could bid on a Toronto subway or <span class="companylink">Hydro-Québec</span> turbines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because so much of the deal depends on the provinces, it will have effects that other trade deals haven't. It will free up trade across provincial lines. It could also mean Ottawa pays for more settlements when provinces breach the deal, like the $130-million tab Stephen Harper picked up for Danny Williams in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once provinces and cities have to open up bidding to EU firms, their tenders are likely to be consistently open to bidders from other parts of Canada, as well. Part of the Harper government's interest in the EU deal has been that it would break down some trade barriers between provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that also means a deal will put restrictions on towns and provinces. When provinces are legally bound, so are municipalities. If Montreal wants to hand a subway contract to Bombardier, it won't be able to. If Ontario wants to promote a green technology industry by requiring <span class="companylink">Ontario Power Generation</span> to buy local, it won't be able to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least in theory. The catch is that if Ontario or Quebec or any other province breaks the rules, it's Ottawa that pays the bill. Ottawa signs trade treaties, so they pay the piper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 2010, when <span class="companylink">AbitibiBowater</span> closed a Newfoundland mill, Danny Williams's government expropriated Abitibi's timber and water rights. The company sued under NAFTA, and Ottawa paid $130-million to settle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harper grumbled. He said he'd create a mechanism so next time, the province would have to pay back Ottawa. But that's not easy. Ottawa has exclusive jurisdiction to sign treaties, but provinces have jurisdictions, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other big trade suits under the NAFTA and WTO, against Ontario's Green Energy Act. The Ontario government argues it has every right to favour a local green-tech industry. That might be politically popular, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a new EU trade deal, where provincial contracts are the big prize, there's all the more potential for provincial decisions to run afoul of the rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European countries long worried whether provinces will be bound by the deal, but they will have to settle for Ottawa being bound for them. Canadian officials said the EU deal won't include any formal sign-on binding the provinces. They expect provinces to signal political support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But of course, future provincial governments can disagree. The trouble is this deal hasn't been through the kind of political crucible that met free trade with the U.S. in the 1988 election. It's hard to argue the people of each province have committed to this deal, warts and all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That will be important. A deal with the EU could set a pattern in which Ottawa and the provinces work together to accept sometimes painful concessions to carve out new markets, if it doesn't lead to costly squabbles.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, for the second (third?) consecutive year, let us suggest a solution to the All-Star Analgesic: Merge it with the Winter Classic. Have the all-stars frolic in the great outdoors before 50,000. And make Jan. 1 a real showcase game on real ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hear us out. One of the growing concerns about the Winter Classic (at least among Hockey Night in Canada host Ron MacLean's book club) is the substandard condition of the ice. The reasoning goes that, if bona fide points in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> standings are at stake, it behooves the league to present a modicum of acceptable ice upon which the teams can perform when playing outdoors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far in the history of the WC, there have been rain storms, deep freezes, postponements and other acts of God that created a patchy skating surface. How patchy? Players say it reminds them of the ice at the Bank Atlantic Center in Sunrise, Fla. Or a snow cone. Same thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the all-star game is heaven-sent for patchy ice. Played at half-speed by players who saw last call the night before, fast ice conditions are not an imperative. Best of all, no one this side of Lady Byng cares who wins, so you remove the MacLean Integrity Factor caused by bad bounces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Winter Classic has become a huge corporate promotion – just like the all-star game. And let's face it, the glassy-eyed suits are not paying attention to the action. It could be in Kansas, as long as there's a hospitality suite. New technologies are making warm climes like Los Angeles and Florida practical, so you can spread it among all teams.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CBC had aired the Grand Slam for four years, but on Jan. 18, it told iSport Media and Management, the circuit's organizer, it was ending coverage immediately. That left the final two events this season with no TV broadcaster. Thus far, no replacement network has been announced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, iSport chief executive officer Kevin Albrecht told The Globe and Mail issues over quality of the broadcasts was a factor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not so, says Jeffrey Orridge, executive director of sports properties for CBC Sports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is about ISport not fulfilling the terms of the contract,” Orridge told Usual Suspects. “We could not go on any further financially under the circumstances. It had nothing to do with quality of production.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CBC carried the series past the point where it made financial sense, he says. “Our concern was for the curlers and the fans who support the sport. We tried to give it every chance to succeed. This wasn't a capricious decision. CBC has had some form of curling since 1962, and we didn't take this lightly. But the time comes when, as a public broadcaster, we have to be prudent. There was no chance of recouping our costs, and we reluctantly made the decision.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Usual Suspects contacted Albrecht, but had not received a reply by publication deadline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orridge says there is no chance of a reconciliation with ISport, but the network would seek to get curling back onto its airwaves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talks between the CBC and <span class="companylink">BCE Inc</span>. with the International Olympic Committee over TV rights for the 2014 Sochi event have stalled. “The good news is we're still talking to the IOC,” Orridge says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You've likely heard the advice many times before: If want to reduce your chances of getting Alzheimer's disease, you need to keep your brain active with tasks such as reading, writing and playing mentally challenging games. It's the old “use it or lose it” refrain.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But except for anecdotal evidence, there has been very little physical proof that this strategy works – until now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new study has revealed that people who engaged in cognitively stimulating activities throughout their lives had fewer brain deposits of beta-amyloid, a destructive protein linked to Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results are based on 65 healthy seniors. They were asked a series of questions to determine how frequently they “exercised” their brains – from age 6 to the present.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The participants also underwent high-tech brain scans to measure amyloid deposits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The more cognitive engagement they had, the less of this amyloid there was in their brain,” said William Jagust, the study's principal investigator at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although all the participants were considered to be mentally fit when they were enrolled in the study, the researchers suspect that those with the highest levels of amyloid will go on to develop Alzheimer's as they grow older.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Jagust noted that it has been difficult to study the disease, partly because a diagnosis could not be confirmed until the patient died and the brain was examined in an autopsy. But recent advances in medical imaging make it possible to detect amyloid in the brains of living patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amyloid plaques, which deposit between nerve cells, are thought to accumulate over a lifetime, eventually leading to interference in memory and other mental processes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no known cure for Alzheimer's, and scientists still don't have a complete understanding of what causes the disease. Earlier research has suggested that certain genes and the aging process likely contribute to plaque formation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new study, published this week in Archives of Neurology, now indicates that a lifestyle factor – namely, mental stimulation – can affect the amount of these deposits. “This is the first time cognitive activity level has been related to amyloid buildup in the brain,” said Susan Landau, a member of the research team at the university.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that's good news because it suggests you can do something to reduce your chances of getting this dreaded disease, Dr. Landau added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But starting to play Sudoku when you are already old and grey may be too late.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our findings suggest that it is a life-long pattern [of mental activity] that's important,” Dr. Landau added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chemicals undermine vaccines</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exposure to a group of chemicals widely used in consumer products reduces the effectiveness of childhood vaccinations, a new study suggests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Children with the highest blood levels of perfluorinated compounds, or PFCs, had the weakest response to tetanus and diphtheria immunization shots, according to the study published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In particular, these kids produced far fewer infection-fighting antibodies in response to the shots. That suggests some children would be still vulnerable to tetanus and diphtheria even though they had been vaccinated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This evidence tells me that the immune system is very sensitive to PFCs,” said the study's lead author, Philippe Grandjean of the University of Southern Denmark in Odense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PFCs can be found in many products including non-stick cookware, stain-resistant clothing, water-repellant rain gear as well as food packaging. They are also extremely durable and persist in the environment for a long time. Most people carry detectable levels of PFCs in their bodies. Research has linked some of these chemicals to thyroid problems and other health concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This latest study, the first to look at PFCs and vaccinations, is based on 587 children born in the Faroe Islands, located in the North Atlantic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PFC levels were measured in the children at age 5. Their mothers were tested when they were pregnant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grandjean, who is also a professor at Harvard University's school of public health in Boston, said a large portion of the PFCs found in these blood tests likely came from eating contaminated fish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he noted that the level of PFCs in the Faroe Islanders is about the same or even less than those in people in Europe and North America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of these chemicals have been on the market for decades – long before governments introduced newer measures to protect consumers from potentially hazardous compounds. “This is a reminder that our system of chemical controls was not as good as it ought to have been,” he commented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sense of fatalism</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with a cancer diagnosis, some people still find it hard to quit smoking, a new study has revealed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. researchers looked at smoking rates among 5,338 patients with either lung or colorectal cancer. At the time of diagnosis, 39 per cent of lung cancer patients and 14 per cent of colorectal cancer were smokers. Five months later, 14 per cent of lung cancer and 9 per cent of colorectal cancer patients continued to puff away, according to their findings published in the journal Cancer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their inability to stop may, in part, stem from a sense of fatalism, said the lead author of the study, Elyse Park of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard University's medical school in Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They feel they can't do it and it's too late anyways.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She insisted, however, it's never too late to butt out. “The chances of doing better with treatment are increased by giving up tobacco,” she said. In fact, some research indicates that smoking interferes with the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiation therapy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet this message isn't always communicated to patients. Or doctors may not provide enough support and guidance on how to quit. “The bottom line is that patients need tobacco [cessation] treatment as part of cancer care,” Dr. Park said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Piracy – arrrhh! It's all that the Hollywood industry, represented by the Motion Picture Association of America, wants to talk about. It's been their favourite campaign for years, claiming billions in lost revenues and jobs devastation. But the issue really hit the headlines when the motion pictures industry's anti-piracy campaign recently ran aground with the tabling of the Stop the Online Piracy Act in the U.S. House of Representatives. The battle has been widely characterized as new media stomping old media, with Silicon Valley showing its power over Hollywood as major Internet companies (<span class="companylink">Google</span>, Wikipedia, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>) used a far more effective anti-censorship campaign to win the public and legislators to its side.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The movie industry looked like the bad guys here, on the wrong side of change, promoting a piece of legislation that seemed reactionary and overreaching, allowing potentially offending sites to be removed from search engines, banned from access to Internet providers and cut off from advertisers. The good news is that we may now finally initiate a more rational discussion of piracy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arguably, piracy is less of a threat to the movie industry than evidence of an untapped market. Studies indicate that when digital content is provided legitimately (as in the iTunes model) piracy decreases. The challenge, then, is to convert pirates into consumers. Currently, the studios release films through a series of revenue-generating windows: theatrical release, then DVD and online, then television.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a system vulnerable to leaks along the way. As well, only about 20 per cent of movies are making profits at theatres, so there's a real incentive to use different models and tap into a potential audience who want to see new movies but don't want to go to the multiplex. Though online distribution may generate smaller earnings per movie than the theatres, the distribution cost is much less and the potential audience much larger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One option would be a Netflix-style movie-rental model, but for new releases as well, which audiences could see with a monthly subscription fee. There could be various tiers, depending on the number of new films a viewer wants to watch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also a great way to introduce newer consumers (the biggest pirating community) to studio's back catalogues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another alternative is the “freeconomics” model, where some movies are given away for free online, either as rewards to loyal movie subscribers or to the wider public on ad-supported websites. In exchange for watching a free film, consumers could offer demographic information to advertisers. Another way to kill piracy is for studios to release the films “day and date” internationally, meaning everyone in the world gets the film on DVD, theatrical and television formats at the same time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The obvious question is what happens to movie theatres? Going to most theatres today combines the least attractive features of an outlet mall and an airport lounge. What they should be focusing on is offering experiences that the online version can't deliver, the kind of communal connections that have made the dozens of film festivals that have popped up so popular. Toronto's new TIFF Bell Lightbox, for example, which specializes in new art-house films and revivals, has discovered that audiences prefer attending a movie when a speaker is included in the package.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Director Kevin Smith has gone on tour with his new film, Red State, giving audiences a premium of seeing the film and lecture. The Doc Soup screenings regularly uses Skype interviews with the directors to enhance the screening .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not entirely a new idea: Back inthe early days of movies, films were sandwiched between vaudeville acts. As well as embracing the digital possibilities, the movie industry could use a lot more vaudeville, to make the experience human again, and keep the pirates at bay.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My interests in the past 50 years as imam of the Ismaili community have been primarily focused on Africa, South Asia, Central Asia and the Middle East – and on improving the quality of life for the people who live there. The more I think about this matter, the more I am convinced that one of the critical barriers to progress is the way in which governing processes occur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The so-called Arab Spring has brought special attention to this challenge, illustrating that it is easier to rally people in opposition to a government than to forge agreement about new governing processes. But, while this pattern has recently been more dramatically evident, it has been a reality for a long time.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In my life, the two moments which contributed most dramatically to this condition were the fall of the British and French colonial empires after the Second World War and then the disintegration of the Soviet Union and its Eastern European empire two decades ago. The process continues today, as developing nations re-examine the structures under which they are governed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases – I think here of Kenya's new constitution – power has been diffused, in response no doubt to pressures from ethnic, economic, religious and other centrifugal forces. One risk of decentralization is that it can place more decision-making power into the hands of communities that have had less access to education and governing experience, and less exposure to national and global issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps this is why, in some cases, the trend has been to consolidate governing authority – such as in Afghanistan, with the aim of overcoming inertia and inefficiency, as well as fragmented and provincial outlooks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The history of constitutions can be seen as an oscillation between the two poles of centralization and diffusion – with new concentrations of power often amplifying the temptation to abuse, while new dispersions of power are often associated with stagnation, paralysis and even more opportunities for corruption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arrangements that effectively balance power – through a federalist approach, for example – are elusive. What is critical is that constitutional arrangements should respect inherited traditions, ensure fairness to minority communities, respond to rural as well as urban concerns and underwrite equitable opportunity for a better life. Reconciling the global and the local, the urban and the rural, the regional and the national, is a formidable challenge – one that calls for the best of our intellectual energies and consistent fine-tuning over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a second question related to the experience of fledgling democracies. In much of the developed world, we have seen the emergence of two-pronged political structures – where one party forms a government and the other constitutes the opposition. This arrangement can foster greater accountability and even a certain stability. But I have to say, I am increasingly skeptical about the emergence of such constructs in many developing countries. I suspect that a continuing multiplicity of widely differentiated parties will mean that some form of coalition government will become the norm. This will especially be the case in societies that are multicultural, multireligious, or struggling to accommodate secular and religious political forces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The difficulty is that multiparty coalitions can be intrinsically undisciplined, with their differing agendas, and often unstable. In such situations, the threat of defection can be highly destabilizing, while accountability is often blurred and transparency is discouraged. Yet, coalition governance is now becoming familiar in many countries of Asia, Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broader the array of parties, the greater the risk that they will be based on personalities or narrow parochial identities, rather than a broadly recognized, predictable point of view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is certainly no straightforward, universal formula to apply in such situations. We must not naively assume that what has worked in some parts of the Western world, for example, will work the same way in less developed contexts. Different places, different histories require quite different approaches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The questions raised by coalition governance are not easy ones, either in the developing world or the developed world. What should be the rules under which parties and other governing entities are put together? How can we best find the glue that will hold them together – such as joint commitments to issues of clear national interest – and to a spirit of pluralism that values conciliation among diversified viewpoints?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let me emphasize that I am not opposed to the concept of coalition government. Indeed, it may be an inevitable response to the intrinsic pluralism of many of the countries in which I work. But the high level of political instability and failure around the world illustrates the need for creative new thinking about this particularly demanding form of democracy. Which constitutional options and best practices will give coalition government the greatest chance of stability and consistent performance?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The alternative is a world widely characterized by significant numbers of unstable states. It is a scenario to be avoided.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By doing so, Mr. Kenney is helping to fulfill the objectives of a sensible policy, which has been fairly successful – to varying degrees in different parts of Canada. In Prince Edward Island, the apparent abuse of the PNP became an issue in the provincial election in October; there have been problems in New Brunswick, too.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Atlantic provinces, 56 per cent of provincial nominees have stayed in the province that was their destination; for the country as the whole, the corresponding number is 82 per cent. Of course, immigrants don't need internal passports to move around in Canada, but the program is less effective if they do not stay in the provinces they were selected for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A working knowledge of English or French is vital for working in Canada; consequently, competence in one or other of the country's official languages should be taken seriously as a precondition for selection in the PNP – which is not always the case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government's study of the program found that only one province (not named) “was able to produce an evidence-based, formal labour market strategy” that tried to connect the demand for particular skills to the choices of immigrants. So the Minister of Immigration wants the identification of such needs to be built into the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kenney and his department are acting prudently by taking steps to make the provincial nominee program better at accomplishing its purposes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to the Smartphone Olympics! What, you thought with this week's news that Apple sold a whopping 37 million of the little miracles in the last quarter that I'd be inveighing against our “addiction” to smartphones and our lack of good manners in using them?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps you thought, I'd be calling in a few experts to pronounce on why spouses are furiously hissing at each other over dinner tables to “turn that damn thing off,” why some grandparents are telling their beloved grandchildren, “if you want to spend time with me, no texting your friends” and why physiotherapists are set to make a bundle on repairing our distended smartphone necks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relax. This is no time for lectures. I don't completely buy into the addiction model to explain our rampant, indiscriminate, obsessive and totally fun use of smartphones. Addiction is a loaded word. Chirpily using it as an excuse for bad behaviour trivializes the terrible struggles of drug and alcohol addicts. (Although I must confess, the oft-repeated 12-step phrase, “Let go and let God” has morphed into “Let go and let Jobs” in the irony chamber of my brain.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No, I'm here to introduce our new universal sport. I'm no athlete, but I believe that I or someone I live with, might even have a shot at owning the podium (or, more to the point, odium) in the smartphone Olympics in some of these marquee events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Rollover: The stealthy, half-roll in bed to turn on your smartphone first thing in the morning, even before lovingly greeting your partner, lest you miss a nanosecond of your data-filled day. To qualify in this event, you must perform the rollover in less than five seamless seconds, literally ceasing to snore, opening one eye, arcing your arm toward the bedside table to reach, switch, click and mutter, while looking at <span class="companylink">Google</span> news, “hmm, that's weird.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The iGlance</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While driving, you slide the smartphone onto your thigh – or better yet velcro it there – and at a stoplight, look quickly to see if anyone has texted you. The skill here is in the head-bob, and of course in remaining undetected by passing traffic cops. Oh and not rear-ending the guy in front. The ethics committee has decided that any attempt to answer a text is too dangerous and will immediately disqualify you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Blowoff</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This daring social gesture is used to aggressively signify you are done with the face-to-face conversation you are having, whether it's with your colleague, your spouse or if you are totally immature, your mother. Nothing subtle here, you must, without actually saying “kill me now,” overtly start playing with your apps. The skill lies in being steely enough to withstand the ire of the person whose physical presence you are denying. Extra points for giving a self-ennobling excuse as to why you are doing this: “I'm just making sure my daughter got home safely from school. (Never mind she is 24 and studying in another country.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dead-Time Double Step</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are skillful enough with a smartphone, there need be no downtime, ever, whether you're in a doctor's reception room, waiting for a bus, or in the supermarket checkout line. You've got your little buddy! This is a subtle event, because there is true but invisible talent involved in not allowing yourself even one moment to daydream, refresh yourself spiritually or even (gasp) engage with strangers. You will be judged on how quickly you whip your phone out, how impermeable the techno bubble around you becomes, and then of course how swiftly you pocket the phone when your name is called, the bus arrives, or the cashier is ready.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Oracle</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this event, if your companion says, just to keep conversation flowing, I wonder if it's going to rain, you must, without looking at the sky, instantly access your weather app and report on the precise possibility of precipitation. If she confesses to a second's indecision about whether a restaurant is on the south or north side, or even if John Kenneth Galbraith is still alive, you will be judged on how obnoxiously, I mean quickly, you can provide an informed reply. The smartphone has killed idle speculation. Long live the know-it-all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Multitasking Triathlon</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While keeping a colleague waiting in your office, in swift sequence you 1. speak on your smartphone to your elderly mother (“Mom, when did you first start feeling dizzy?”), 2. text your teenager (U may not go shopping until project done!!!) and 3. add “plum tomatoes” to your cellphone shopping list. Winner must complete all three applications, turn, smile (tightly) and say “where were we? in less than 30 seconds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As you can see, there is no end of highly skilled events in the Smartphone Olympics. Feel free to invent your own. And at this point it's no use adapting a Thoreau-like stance, claiming to be above it all. Today, 37 million, tomorrow, billions will know only a world in which “smart,” as the newly deposed executives of our once proud <span class="companylink">Research in Motion</span> sadly know only too well, means “look what my phone can do.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, right now, a baby is being born who will start using smartphone technology before she can speak. She is right there in the delivery room, in the arms of her exhausted mother. Her father? He's busy texting.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was at Toronto City Hall a couple weeks ago for a wedding. On that cold Saturday afternoon, as the sunlight streamed into the unadorned but elegant chambers, the bride and groom that we'd all come to watch tie the knot repeated the usual promises to stick by each other through the ups and downs. These vows were touching and yanked a few tears, but the two dozen friends and family in the room didn't have to reach for their handkerchiefs until near the end, when the bride pulled out a piece of folded paper and read some words about how much her new husband has meant to her over the years – all 26 of them.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've been to a few weddings in my time, but this one – between my girlfriend's father and his partner – was the first I'd attended where the couple weren't simply making abstract promises to the future, but were also celebrating a love that was already a proven reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the early days of a relationship, commitment is largely about surviving uncertainty. Back when I dabbled in online dating, I remember that the key word – the one that appeared in every woman's description of “what I want in a man” – was confidence. Confidence at the beginning of a relationship is, of course, the ability to bear with grace the uncertainty that dating entails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family and friends who attend early-days weddings bear this uncertainty, too, and our unflagging ability to do so reflects well our society's steadfastly optimistic nature in the face of the divorce rate. These ceremonies always convey this romance of our collective spirit, but if you're looking for the most poignant celebration of love and relationship, it seems to me now that it's the late-in-love wedding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One couple I know had been together nearly 20 years when they planned their wedding – pretty much by accident. As they organized a celebration of Marni's 50th birthday, they realized the guest list would make for a great wedding reception, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When we were growing up emotionally in the sixties and seventies, marriage was out of fashion, politically and culturally,” Brian said. “And frankly, one reason I was not eager to get married earlier was the feeling of, ‘If it ain't broke don't fix it.' Marriage and divorce seemed joined at the hip to me. The beginning of the end.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it happened, their wedding came at a time when their teenage son would be old enough to enjoy the evening – he played Wipe Out on the electric guitar – and when their parents were still alive and well enough to attend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You can make the mistake of thinking that your relationship is private,” Marni said, looking back at her common-law era. “But we all invest in other people's relationships. It's in the eyes of your community that you really marry and your friends and community also mean more to you later in life.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sheldon, one half of a same-sex couple that married in 2007 – two years after it became legal in Canada – says he and his partner hadn't ever wanted to get married before the law was changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As we inched toward our 10th anniversary, we were talking about how to celebrate it,” he told me this week. The two of them discussed taking a trip around the world, but then Sheldon's partner suggested a wedding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It wasn't something I yearned for,” he said. “You have love, you live with love and you go through life. We lived for 10 years together. I would say the knot was already tied.” But he agreed and then was surprised at how much of an impact the celebration ended up having on him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It sounds romantic, but it's like suddenly with that act you don't just live your life and that's all. You take a little stop and you cherish it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The poignant effect of framing a moment in time isn't exclusive to weddings that occur later in a relationship, but again, I'd say that the emotion carries a greater resonance. Indeed, at the wedding I attended a couple weeks ago, everyone in that small room in City Hall felt that little stop in their own lives – whether the love was for them abstract, a beginning of a life together, or a life and love already shared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian had spoken of a similar infectiousness about his party with Marni. “Our wedding was a gesture that felt generous,” he said. “We were asking people to celebrate our romance and that we'd gotten that far, but it did feel like we were also spreading the love. We were showing them there's romance in midlife.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's a simple statistic from which two tales flow: In the first five years of the Harper government, the number of information officers in the federal government grew by 16 per cent, to 4,459 from 3,855.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two tales are these: that the increase in information officers reflects the abiding, daily preoccupation of this government with controlling and disseminating information; and that under this government, spending has swelled greatly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone with any acquaintance of this government knows its mania for information control. Although information officers have grown in number throughout the government, all messaging (down to the finest details) is controlled in the Prime Minister's Office and the Privy Council Office, where, predictably, the number of people working on information has also grown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Media calls, requests for information, press releases, general media strategy, requests for interviews, required answers and everything else associated with developing and disseminating the government's “line” is co-ordinated centrally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such centralization raises the question why information officers have grown throughout the government, when much of their job, at least in terms of releasing information, is to make as little of it public as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the growth is about this overall mania about information, including minute monitoring of all commentary about the government. Part might be about the increase in social media, websites and other “new” media that are supplanting traditional forms. But a lot has to do with the generalized dynamic that bureaucracies self-perpetuate and grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, in Ottawa and Toronto, there are spending reviews under way with outside consultants (Deloitte in Ottawa; Don Drummond at Queen's Park) helping to outline reduction options for politicians. Both governments face deficits, and both preside over bureaucracies that have grown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These kind of reviews are necessary from time to time, because without them governments just grow, willy-nilly. It isn't an anti-government screed to insist that programs periodically have to be reviewed, spending priorities rearranged and decisions made to stop doing things that have outgrown their usefulness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both the political and bureaucratic dynamics push governments to grow. There are always insistent demands from the population as a whole, and especially from particular groups within it, for more spending or tax relief. The media is a bullhorn for these demands, and opposition parties always believe governments are not doing enough rather than doing too much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governments themselves overwhelmingly feel their re-election chances are enhanced by spending rather than retrenching. This applies quite often to conservative governments that enter office promising lower taxes, smaller government and balanced budgets, but which throughout North America, with a few exceptions, have delivered lower taxes, bigger government and large deficits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've been watching this dynamic at work in the last few weeks. Thursday, Treasury Board President Tony Clement warned of big and early spending cuts and Mr. Harper spoke of “major transformations” while in Davos, Switzerland. Yet over the past two weeks, the Prime Minister and other ministers have been travelling Canada touting spending projects from Halifax to Saguenay to Toronto to Vancouver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is very hard to cut spending, except the easy way, which is to freeze or restrain increases in public service wages and pensions. This might buy temporary relief, but does not fundamentally alter a government's structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only way to change spending fundamentally is what self-perpetuating bureaucracies struggle to accomplish: to deliver services in a dramatically different and lower-cost fashion, and to just plain stop doing things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble with getting out of a program is that groups have become dependent upon it. If a government ends it, political hell risks breaking loose, with the aggrieved groups in full howl, the media echoing their complaints and the opposition piling on. The big picture of overall spending gets lost in the shouting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is so much easier to add programs than subtract them, so much more enticing to voters to offer than take away, so much simpler to say yes than no, so much less difficult to let spending take its course than to make hard and politically costly decisions.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growing household debt of Canadians who should be in their prime savings years reflects demographic changes that will alter the nature of retirement, in ways that have some surprisingly positive sides. They may be “punch-drunk” on low interest rates, as a report by the CIBC economist Avery Shenfeld suggests, but they are also responding in natural and often productive ways to the exigencies of raising children later in life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even apart from the deceptively sweet punch of mortgage rates at 3 per cent and credit lines secured to homes at 4 per cent, it's easy to see why people are taking on higher debt loads than previous generations of people 45-plus: They are having children in their 40s and 50s. They are supporting multiple households as a result of divorce and remarriage. Their children need to pay postsecondary tuition costs that are far higher than they used to be, and they need more years of study to gain an edge in the job market.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People are continuing to take on debt past age 45 for a mix of reasons – because they must and because they can. To some extent, the willingness to go deeper into debt reflects a confidence in themselves and their ability to continue making a living, the economy that provides that living, and the housing market in which much of their wealth is tied up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downside is well-known. They might become infirm. The economy could go into recession. The housing market could undergo a United States-style crash. Interest rates could (and no doubt will) rise again to more normal levels. The risks are manifold. It is far from ideal to carry a large debt load into later years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are positive sides, too. With all that debt, they will need to find continued sources of income. Many will need (and some may even want) to keep working in some form, to be entrepreneurial. Need drives innovation, and Canada will see an unleashing of creativity from older people. And the investments they make in their children's education (and travel, sports and music) will pay off down the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not a generation on a precipice, as Mr. Shenfeld and a second CIBC economist, Benjamin Tal, acknowledge in a second report. “The danger instead is that low interest rates lose their power to propel growth,” they write. In other words, the bigger danger is to the economy – if people stop borrowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everything about the new generation now headed for the “retirement years” will be different from its predecessors – its family makeup, its aspirations (people aren't as likely to downsize, especially with so many adult children returning home) and its tendency to keep borrowing. It's risky to be punch-drunk, and many people are courting more than a bit of risk; but in risk is the possibility of growth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, in the lead-up to Prime Minister Stephen Harper's meeting with first nations, Derek Nepinak, Grand Chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, told The Globe and Mail he'd be asking Mr. Harper to schedule a conference of first ministers to explicitly spell out the constitutional rights of indigenous peoples. However, at their meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Harper gave no indication he'd be any more interested in discussing that issue than the Senate or Quebec.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As anyone who followed the Meech Lake saga will appreciate, Chief Nepinak's demand was not without some irony. For was it not a Manitoba native legislator who held up a feather and killed the accord designed to reconcile Quebec with Canada's Constitution?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, Elijah Harper, too, demanded a constitutional conference to deal with aboriginal rights. And he was not mollified when it was pointed out that there had already been four since the Constitution was patriated, or that premiers had agreed unanimously in 1986 to deal with Quebec's demands alone. For their part, leaders of the Assembly of First Nations could not be convinced by government representatives that a successful Quebec round would lead to further constitutional discussions, including on aboriginal rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, it's unfair to single out aboriginal Canadians in the death of the Meech Lake accord. Back then, Alberta Senate reformers, too, refused to accept the agenda constraints of a Quebec round, though that had been agreed to under the chairmanship of their premier, Don Getty. And campaigners such as Senator Bert Brown (as he is today) rejected the notion that his long-sought objective would be easier to secure once the Quebec issue had been resolved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, 20 years after the national referendum in which Canadians rejected the Charlottetown accord – an accord that addressed all constitutional demands simultaneously – no government appears eager to repeat the experience. Today, even a powerful Prime Minister atop a majority government is stymied in one of his key priorities, and Mr. Harper is having to pursue an elected Senate through the back door. Moreover, his institutional tinkering has started serious people talking about electing and then appointing future governors-general in a similar process, effectively doing away with the monarchy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the long Meech Lake saga, three predictions were made about Canada's future insofar as the Constitution was concerned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his appearance before a Senate committee where he denounced the accord, former PM Pierre Trudeau stated that Meech Lake was unnecessary, as Canada had a Constitution that would last 1,000 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, Brian Mulroney – in a vain attempt to persuade Manitoba and Newfoundland to ratify the accord – predicted that on the night of a future referendum, Canadians would look back and regret not having resolved the problem of Quebec's constitutional isolation at a reasonable price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For his part, Jean Chrétien – who played a key role in killing the accord – said it would be no big deal if Meech Lake failed. It was like getting stuck in the snow, he said, you go forward and back and eventually you get unstuck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, we know that Mr. Chrétien was wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And although it's too early to say whether Mr. Trudeau's or Mr. Mulroney's prediction will prove more prescient, one thing is sure: Proposals and demands for constitutional reform will continue to build up, leaving Canadians to work around a Constitution that effectively cannot be amended.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After an explosion destroyed the <span class="companylink">Babine Forest Products</span> sawmill in Burns Lake last week, families in the community lit two candles for missing and injured workers. Then they lit a third candle for the mill itself.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the mill opened in 1975 as a joint venture with the local first nations, the village has relied on the mill as its prime source of jobs. Amid the grief and anger over the loss of life and the horrific injuries, there is deep anxiety for the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. Jobs Minister Pat Bell is set to arrive in the village on Friday to help the community with its “economic transition.” More than anything, the workers and their families want to know how he can convince the mill's owners, Oregon-based <span class="companylink">Hampton Affiliates</span>, to rebuild.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as he drives along Highway 16 toward the village, Mr. Bell can't ignore what the people of Burns Lake know all too well: The forest around them is dead or dying. This is the epicentre of the pine beetle epidemic. Any company willing to spend $30-million or more to build a new mill will want assurances that the timber will keep coming for decades. And unless the government is prepared to change the rules, such a commitment seems unlikely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Hill after hill after hill of red and grey trees” is how MaryAnne Arcand remembers her last drive over resource roads south of Burns Lake. “Some of them just big matchsticks. You feel really vulnerable.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Arcand is executive director of the Central Interior Logging Association. In addition to the 280 direct mill jobs, she noted, there are another 500 independent contractors – loggers and truckers – who worked at supplying timber to the mill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contractors are not eligible for employment insurance, so she has spent the week drumming up work for them with other employers in the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately for those workers, there are still seven big mills in the area, including Canfor's Houston operation, which boasts the biggest sawmill output in the world. Ms. Arcand has come up with dozens of jobs already for buncher operators, haulers, skidder operators and stump-to-dump contractors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Babine Forest Products</span> also has something going for it: the rights to about half a million cubic metres of wood per year that it can sell to the highest bidder. And there is a market for the wood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that cash asset is there regardless of whether the owners rebuild. The mills along Highway 16 are already competing for timber. And the falldown – when the annual allowable cut will have to be reduced and the pine beetle-killed wood is no longer merchantable timber – is coming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province's chief forester, Jim Snetsinger, is working on a technical report for Forests Minister Steve Thomson on the timber supply in the mountain pine beetle zones. The review looks at whether the mills in the region can be kept open if B.C. lifts constraints on the land base that were established under the Harcourt government in the 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“With the urgent situation in Burns Lake, a lot of the work we had been doing for the region is going to be part of that discussion,” Mr. Thomson said in an interview Thursday. “This has accelerated some of the work we need to do.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Association of BC Professional Foresters is worried the falldown will lead to an excuse to gut the region's longstanding land-use plans. In a submission to the chief forester last November, they warned against “making short-term tradeoffs” against the long-term health of these battered forests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further, the association is warning that freeing up more timber is not the solution: “Changing management requirements would not prevent mill closures. Rather, it will just postpone the inevitable falldown in timber supply.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob Simpson, the Independent MLA for Cariboo North, said the government can't stall on this question anymore. “The chief forester and the Forests Minister must immediately answer the question of whether a long-term timber supply exists for this mill,” he said, “so at least this one issue can be clarified in the deliberations about the feasibility of rebuilding the mill.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lasting solution – which the people of Burns Lake sorely need – will require confronting the problem that the government has been evading for a decade.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least Scotland's secessionists are honest (maybe), which is more than could be said of Quebec's secessionists.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, in a potentially momentous development, Scotland's secessionist government unveiled the question it proposes for a 2014 referendum: “Do you agree that Scotland should be an independent country?” Yes or no.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics cried that a clear question should have mentioned Scotland leaving the United Kingdom. But compared with what Canada had to endure twice in the Parti Québécois referendums – convoluted questions full of suppositions and affirmations – the Scottish one is a model of clarity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Scottish Nationalist Party have a majority in the Scottish Parliament. They were elected on a promise to hold a referendum, and appear intent on keeping their word.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why wait until 2014? Because that's the 700th anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn, and all the historical mythology and ideology that will bring. Braveheart, kilts, bagpipes, the clearances, Robbie Burns – if you think we of Scottish decent, however distant, can summon up history, you haven't seen anything until you witness what SNP leader Alex Salmond and his group will do leading up to the referendum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scotland joined England in a forced merger in 1707, producing one of the world's most enduringly successful countries, in which Scotland played more than its full share. We in Canada know that, since the Scots largely ran the place for a long time – and well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why anyone would want to smash such an enduringly successful country is a mystery to those who think rationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key question for small political entities in today's globalized world is: With whom are we better to be in association? In the United Kingdom, Scotland has a much, much bigger voice than it would in the 27-country European Union, where it would be swamped. Moreover, it would lose all the money England transfers to Scotland, something secessionists ignore. Or rather, they say the money would be more than accounted for by all that North Sea oil revenue. Except that North Sea oil is a declining resource – Scottish independence is forever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this week's document, Mr. Salmond admits: “Ours is a lucky nation, blessed with natural resources, bright people and a united society. We have an independent education system, legal system and National Health Service. … Scotland is not oppressed and we have no need to be liberated.” And so?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He argues that even better things lie ahead for a small unattached country that repatriates all power, only to give a bunch of it away to Brussels. It's the same false argument Quebec secessionists made for three decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While in Scotland, secessionists love ripping the English, rooting against English teams, bemoaning Scotland's sad fate in the union, deploring this or that cultural trait of the English. While in London this week, however, Mr. Salmond said the Scots and the English would be great friends – after Scotland separated. An independent Scotland would even keep the Queen, he promised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(The English aren't buying. Polls this week say support for Scottish independence is higher among them than among the Scots.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's also what Quebec secessionists kept repeating. After the agonies of splitting one of the world's most successful countries, everyone would live happily ever after. In the breakup negotiations, things would work out just as Quebec wanted. Just as in the Scotland-England breakup, everything would work out just as the Scottish secessionists believe, or want to believe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much can and will happen in the long period before the referendum. There might be constitutional challenges. Mr. Salmond has hinted he might add a third question to the referendum about maximizing devolution but stopping short of full independence. There will be endless speeches, campaigning and efforts thrown into the fray – just as Canadian energies were diverted, with terrible consequences, into the domestic constitutional wars of 1976 to 1995. Those who lived through those wars here would never wish them on anyone else.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were several hypothetical questions put forward during the 24th in the seemingly interminable run of Republican candidates debates – a series that threatens to become the longest-running comedy on American television.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, moderator Brian Williams posed this question: “Let's say President Romney gets that phone call, and it is to say that Fidel Castro has died. And there are credible people in the Pentagon who predict upwards of half a million Cubans may take that as a cue to come to the United States. What do you do?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly afterward, Mr. Williams asked: “If there was a strong lobby of Chinese dissidents living in a state as politically important as Florida,” would America “have a trade policy with China that looks more like the trade policy with Cuba?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and Jon Huntsman now vanished from the race like so many wacky sitcom neighbours (or, in Mr. Huntsman's case, like one of Mary Tyler Moore's instantly forgotten dates), these touches of whimsy were, I think, appreciated by the viewers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wanted Mr. Williams to take it further. I'd like to see these debates move beyond the realm of speculative fiction – and through the next, obvious questions, such as, “If these half million Cubans were to marry that strong lobby of Chinese dissidents, what would they serve at the wedding, Mr. Gingrich?” – and into outright fantasy: “The forces of Isengard have laid siege to the fortress at Helm's Deep and the Free People of Middle-earth are beset on all sides by the armies of the Dark Lord Sauron, Governor Romney. How do you plan to reach out to our traditional allies, the Ents?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, Newt Gingrich was happy to devote national airtime to the question of whether Imaginary Dead Castro was going to heaven or, as he cautiously put it (this was, after all, prime time), “the other place.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crowd loved that – although, partly because he was unable to shake off questions about his highly lucrative sideline as a “historian” specializing in not-lobbying for <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, it was an off night for Mr. Gingrich. This despite his recent win in the South Carolina primary, where he was overwhelmingly the first choice among low-income voters, most of whom probably realized that, statistically, there's a greater chance that Newt Gingrich will marry them than that Mitt Romney will give them a job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Basically, it can be said of these low-bar debates that Mr. Gingrich has been playing checkers while almost everyone else has been visibly trying to resist the temptation to stuff the checker pieces up their own noses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just in case you missed the point there, no one in the Republican primaries is playing chess. No one. This is the kind of race in which a candidate such as Ron (Gold Standard) Paul starts to look like a genius just for saying that America shouldn't go to war with Cuba (or, as Rick Santorum recently declared it, Iran's island outpost). When Ron Paul starts to sound sane, it's like the streetlights have gone on and it's time to go home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've been wondering all along whether the ratings for these debates have been solid despite the paucity of talent in the race or because of the comedy inherent in that paucity. A year ago, when the debates began, the candidates chose a strategy that made sense: They sparred little with each other and campaigned aggressively, in unison, against Barack Obama. When Mr. Obama's popularity was low, this worked. But now optimism about the economy is up. An NBC poll released this week showed that 37 per cent of Americans believe the economy will improve in the next year, versus 17 per cent who believe it will get worse – a reversal of the numbers in the fall. The U.S. unemployment rate is below 9 per cent for the first time in two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The President is reaping the benefits – more people approve than disapprove of his performance, and an impressive 91 per cent of viewers approved of the proposals in his State of the Union Address. Those proposals were frequently the opposite of those put forward by the Republican favourite, Mr. Romney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday night's debate was The Moon Colony Debate, but I'm hoping for increasingly fanciful themed debates. A Vicars and Tarts Debate! A Black and White Debate, an elegantly All-American tribute to Truman Capote. Perhaps a Murder Mystery Debate, where one of the candidates gets “murdered” during the commercial break and the remaining candidates have to guess who did it. At least, then, everyone would get a nice steak dinner.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newly elected Vancouver city councillor Adriane Carr helped to found and lead the Green Party of Canada, helped end the war in the woods in Clayoquot Sound, and even talked her way into two televised provincial election leaders' debates. But she is about to enter a world of pain that none of her previous experience could have prepared her for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Carr is wading into the dog debate in Vancouver.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Carr squeaked onto Vancouver council last November as a Green Party member, defeating incumbent Ellen Woodsworth by 90 votes. Her election followed four unsuccessful runs for provincial office, two unsuccessful runs for a federal seat, and one unsuccessful run for the school board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So one might wonder, given her “eighth-time lucky” status, why Ms. Carr would, in her first motion as an elected politician, wade into an issue as volatile as Vancouver's animal control bylaw.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vancouver is divided roughly equally into two camps: dog lovers, and everyone else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the heart of the tension is the animal control bylaw; specifically, the provisions requiring dog owners to leash their animals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five years ago, the Vancouver Park Board struck a task force to look at the question of peaceful co-existence between dog owners who were demanding more off-leash areas, and non-dog-owning citizens who preferred the status quo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The task force imploded – or, officially, “disbanded” – with members not able to agree on a direction or plan of action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The park board revived the effort last July and is promising specific measures some time this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One need not travel very far nor look very hard to find a violation of the animal control act. Off-leash dogs roam the city at will, their owners often trailing far behind them. They frolic happily off-leash in parks not designated as such.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not those dogs that concern Ms. Carr.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What caught Ms. Carr's attention is the story of Kitsilano resident Jacqui Brown. A couple of weeks ago, Ms. Brown tied her dog to a bike rack on West Broadway while she ducked into a drug store to grab something. She says she stepped outside to find an animal control officer hustling the dog into a van.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Brown was fined $250 (the fine could have been higher, as her dog was unlicensed).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turns out tying your dog to a post, bike rack, parking meter or anything else is illegal in the city of Vancouver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the section of the bylaw Ms. Carr wants to change. “I think it's unfair to responsible dog owners and their dogs,” she told me in an interview this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Carr lives in the West End, where there are plenty of dogs. She doesn't see a problem with someone who is walking their dog tying it up for a couple of minutes while they grab a newspaper or coffee. “I think most of those people don't even know that the bylaw exists that makes it illegal for them to do that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since my conversation with Ms. Carr, I've heard many arguments for and against her motion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people combine walking the dog with running an errand, and say that not being able to accomplish both at the same time would have a serious impact on their lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others oppose the motion because they love dogs and think it cruel or inhumane to leave an animal tied up for any length of time. They also worry about unattended dogs being injured or even stolen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there are those who worry that even the best-behaved dogs may occasionally act unpredictably, especially if approached by children. I heard from one man who describes his dog as well-behaved and well-socialized, but once, tied up outside a store, it got scared and bit a child.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Carr dismisses these concerns, saying other provisions of the animal control bylaw already cover vicious or aggressive dogs, dogs that are treated poorly, and dogs that bark or whine excessively. She says children could be taught to avoid dogs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides, she says, these dogs will be on leash, even if the leash happens to be wrapped around a parking meter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm never one to make predictions, but I have it on good authority that some time ago, when the Vancouver Park Board wanted to pack the room on, say, budget night, they would put a dog-related item on the agenda. Nothing drew a crowd quite like dogs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Carr's motion is scheduled to go to council on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wish her well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If history holds true, the motion will be moved to committee to accommodate the scores of people who demand to speak, the overflow seating will be hauled out of storage, and someone will end up picking up poop – metaphorically, of course.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saturday, Comedy, 9 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I hate people who don't hate people,” says DiGiovanni, the Toronto-based stand-up comic, in this hilarious special, made for the Showtime channel. One of Canada's best-known comics these days – she can be heard on CBC Radio's The Debaters and is a judge on the MuchMusic show Video on Trial – her act is all lethal self-deprecation. Much of it is about her weight, but she can also be savage about showbiz and, well, about men. “If you want to make a woman really mad, tell her to relax. That will do it. I'll flip over a table if someone tells me that.” An account of joining a gym is brutally honest and a rant about diets she has tried is both rude and funny. Mainly it's all about her but the humour is universal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Interrupters</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saturday, CBC NN, 9:30 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve James, who made the classic doc Hoop Dreams, made this much-praised look at CeaseFire, a Chicago group trying to defuse and ultimately end gang violence there. The title comes from the belief that violence is a disease, spread from person to person, and can be stopped by “interrupting” the spread. At the doc's core is Ameena Matthews, daughter of a notorious Chicago gang leader and now devoted to training people to spread conflict-resolution tactics that stop violence. It's an extraordinary portrait of Matthews, who is a vital, powerful figure. Her cohorts are mostly men who have had the sobering experience of prison time after indulging in violence. They intervene in petty disputes and large, toxic ones. The doc is one of those that surges on hope, the hope that the tactics will actually work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">18th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunday, Global, 8 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In awards season, some people will watch anything that has movie stars traipsing around and making speeches. Hence the rise of the SAG shindig from lowly status to big-time TV coverage. This is an actors-only event. No speeches from technical people you've never heard of. Among the presenters are Kathy Bates, George Clooney, Jessica Chastain, Melissa McCarthy, Brad Pitt, Owen Wilson and Kristen Wiig. Such categories as Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture mean that armies of movie actors are there. Also, many people from the TV racket are present. A nomination for the cast of Game of Thrones means 33 actors from it are nominated. Expect long-winded speeches, inside jokes and, of course, exhortations to help various causes. And the frocks. Lotsa lady actors in gee-whiz frocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luck</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunday, HBO Canada, 8 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is HBO's first glamour show of 2012. Luck is a work of genius and not your average show in terms of background explanations and easy-to-follow plotlines. It's dense, tricky and slides all over to tell a complex story. From Deadwood creator David Milch and directed by Michael Mann, it stars Dustin Hoffman, Dennis Farina, John Ortiz, Nick Nolte and Michael Gambon in a drama about the winners, losers, sharks and suckers at a local horse-racing track. Mann makes it look spectacularly beautiful, and the horse-racing sequences are breathtaking. As much as there is beauty, though, this is very much a dark drama about the hard-edged side of the racing and gambling worlds. Not easy viewing, but not to be missed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nycole Turmel begins this crucial political winter hobbled by poor polls, facing criticism her New Democrats are irrelevant, and with a team of front-benchers who were not meant to be there.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is what happens when the B-team is forced to become the A-team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pressed into action last summer, Ms. Turmel, the interim leader and herself a rookie MP, had to fill key vacancies in her shadow cabinet with other rookies and some less-seasoned MPs after Jack Layton's sudden death triggered a leadership contest and a stampede of senior MPs to the race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that time, there were concerns the bleeding of front-bench strength could become an issue for the Official Opposition. Recent polls have now borne out these concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the House returns on Monday after its six-week Christmas break, Ms. Turmel is not planning changes to her shadow cabinet, says her chief of staff, Anne McGrath. Those may come after a new leader is elected on March 24 in Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until then, there is the Harper government to hold to account, which, after five years in minority, is emboldened by its big majority. It is promising not only to cut deeply and ruthlessly into government spending – all of which will be revealed in the spring budget – but also to transform Canada's retirement pension system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Against this backdrop, what is the NDP to do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's not much it can do, according to Youri Rivest, the CROP pollster who released a devastating online survey this week. Concentrating only on Quebec, it showed the NDP with 29 per cent support, which is almost half of what it had in the May election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's a big downward spiral for them right now,” Mr. Rivest says. “They are pretty absent in Quebec. They are not really relevant right now, and I think people don't know what they stand for.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not a good place to be, especially given that the party derives its Official Opposition status on the strength of its 58 MPs from Quebec – more than half of its caucus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than that, the Liberals in Quebec are profiting from the NDP's tumble, Mr. Rivest says. His poll shows the Liberals gained nine points – to 19 per cent support from 10 per cent – since the election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And even with a new leader expected in March, Mr. Rivest does not see much of a change in the NDP's fortunes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“ … he [or she] has to fill big shoes, Jack Layton's shoes,” Mr. Rivest asserts. “Mr. Layton had a lot of sympathy, and expectations are huge.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, however, NDP MPs met in Ottawa for their winter caucus retreat, strategizing on how to get through the next several weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We do have two crucial months,” acknowledges Ms. McGrath, noting the budget will come down during that time. “… That's very big, and a lot of people are very worried about what is going to be in the budget.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She adds, however, that not all is doom and gloom and that criticisms of a weak front bench are unfounded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We've developed a really strong team now here on the Hill in order to take the Conservatives on,” Ms. McGrath says, arguing the critics have gelled in their positions and are comfortable with their files.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP will go after the Tories on the economy and lack of a jobs strategy – not much of a change of direction from the fall session. Health care is a big issue for them, too, with the federal government unilaterally deciding that it's going to work against the provinces, Ms. McGrath says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was referring to the Harper government's take-it-or-leave-it health accord presented to the provinces before Christmas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the daily, televised Question Period – the most visible part of Parliament – the NDP is now working on a strategy to make Harper cabinet ministers more accountable. Ministers' reliance on talking points – scripts provided by the Prime Minister's Office – is turning the 45-minute session into a joke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're talking a bit about how we can either move them off [talking points],” Ms. McGrath says, “or make it abundantly clear to Canada that the government has no interest in being accountable …”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She would not elaborate on exactly how they will do this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robin Sears has some ideas. The former NDP national director, now a principal at Navigator, a strategic communications company, says the NDP must resist the temptation to “fire off in all directions, respond to whatever is going on that day …”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The budget is the key to this sitting, and he believes it will overshadow every other issue. The challenge, he says, is to prepare well and pick some very narrow slices of the political agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And try and give their best shot that way,” he says.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES -- eduhatschek@globeandmail.com</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He played college hockey for the University of Massachusetts, and in the dorms, whenever Jonathan Quick and his roommates turned on television, there wasn't a lot of viewing options.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But one channel we did get was NESN,” said Quick, the all-star goaltender for the Los Angeles Kings, “and it was right when Tim Thomas just came into the league. So I watched him quite a bit and what sticks out mostly about his game is that it's a little unorthodox. He doesn't play similar to many goalies in the league, but one thing he does better than probably anybody is the way he competes to stop the pucks, the way he fights to see pucks and how he finds a way to get in front of them.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So if there is a little bit of Thomas in Quick's emerging game, well, he comes by it honestly. The Boston Bruins veteran is the reigning Vézina Trophy winner, the most valuable player of last year's Stanley Cup final and, politics aside, the starting goaltender in this weekend's NHL all-star game in Ottawa. Thomas is also at the forefront of a quiet but discernible trend in the United States: the development of high-end goaltenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three of the six goalies chosen to play in the 2012 NHL all-star game are American-born: Thomas (Flint, Mich.), Quick (Milford, Conn.) and Jimmy Howard (Syracuse, N.Y.) of the Detroit Red Wings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. manufacturing may be having a tough time of it elsewhere, but the U.S. goaltending factory is churning them out almost as fast as the world leaders, Finland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider that this year, Thomas, Quick and Howard are in the top 10 in all four major goaltending categories – goals-against average, wins, save percentage and shutouts, with Howard tops in wins and Quick first in shutouts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craig Anderson (Park Ridge, Ill.) of the Ottawa Senators is tied for third in wins; the Cory Schneider (Marblehead, Mass.) of the Vancouver Canucks is sixth in save percentage and a rising star; Ryan Miller (East Lansing, Mich.) of the Buffalo Sabres was the men's MVP of the 2010 Winter Olympics, won the 2010 Vézina Trophy and is a perennial all-star having an off-season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are others who've had NHL successes before injuries set them back (Al Montoya and Rick DiPietro, for example); and there are some good ones coming in (Jack Campbell and John Gibson, who were most recently seen with the U.S. world junior team).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quick's teammate in Los Angeles, defenceman Jack Johnson, says the crease is one area where his country approaches Canada in terms of overall depth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You think of the last Olympics, Thomas and Miller and Quick,” Johnson said. “I thought all three were awesome goalies. A lot of people talk about the depth of the American hockey team when you put together an Olympic team and there's not the kind of players you have with Team Canada, where you have about 60. But it's different in goal. I wish I had a good answer as to why, but it's a nice luxury to have.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Anderson, many of the U.S. goaltenders – Quick excepted – fell into the late-bloomer category, players who waited a long time before somebody gave them a chance to be a starter in the NHL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For me, it was just finding a good fit,” Anderson said. “I had some success in Colorado by getting an opportunity to play a string of games. I never had the opportunity before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Obviously, Quick came into an L.A. situation where they were young and they said, ‘Here you go, here's the ball, run with it.' And he took off with it. Obviously, Thomas was one of the better goalies in Europe and came back and got the opportunity with Boston and he's run with it. It's guys making the most of their opportunities,” he said. “Opportunistic Americans, I guess.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for playing in the 2012 all-star game, where he is the only Kings representative, Quick says he is looking forward to the experience.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question My best friend and I – both busy moms – want to take a trip to celebrate our 40th birthdays. We want hiking, sightseeing and relaxation, too. Any ideas?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're looking for an urban escape, consider places like Vancouver, New York or Paris. You can walk your feet off, take in the cultural sights, admire the scenery and then linger over locavore meals, interruption-free. (Imagine that!) But for the Big 40, you might long for something more distinct. Jessica Ainlay, who explores the world as one half of GlobetrotterGirls (globetrottergirls.com), has these suggestions:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Costa Rica</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manuel Antonio National Park on the Pacific Coast meets your criteria if wildlife and natural beauty is on your sightseeing agenda. You'll find cliffside rooms with a sweeping view of the beach, jungles filled with black iguanas, three-toed sloths and purple-crowned fairy hummingbirds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The national park would be the main place to hike,” says Ainlay, who visited 11 countries last year, including Costa Rica. “It's easy and is filled with animals: Sightings of monkeys and sloth, coatis, exotic birds and many other animals are practically guaranteed. … The hiking paths are all very scenic, leading through the lush jungle or following the coast line, including some remote beaches.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all that, relax at your ocean-view swimming pool or spa. There's a range of accommodation, but Parador Resort and Spa (hotelparador.com), Gaia Hotel and Reserve (gaiahr.com) and Issimo Suites (issimosuites.com) have all garnered notice for those looking to splurge, Ainlay says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southern Germany</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you favour beer steins over beaches, consider southern Bavaria in the foothills of the Alps. This is a land of fairy-tale castles, traditional spa towns and air so fresh “you try to gulp it in by the bucketful,” Ainlay says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She suggests basing yourself in the small and historic town of Fuessen (fuessen.de), a two-hour train ride from Munich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are a number of different paths – from easy strolls through the river valley to serious hikes through the mountains. You can actually walk from Fuessen to Neuschwanstein Castle alongside the Alps. No matter how strenuous the hikes, a stay at a spa hotel like Wellnesshotel Sommer (hotel-sommer.de) will relax the muscles and the mind.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or capture your birthday moment atop Germany's highest mountain, Zugspitze. Located about an hour from Fuessen, you can hike up (and ski down in the winter) or take a heart-pumping ride in a cable car that literally zips to the top.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OUR READERS WRITE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Karan Smith offered advice on getting to Yellowknife to see the Northern Lights on a budget. Many of you had other ideas about how to see the spectacle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“How do I see the Northern Lights on a budget?” Silly question and even sillier advice. The correct answer is: Subscribe to Aurora Watch, or Space Weather and sites like that. When they signal a high-energy burst, or CME from the sun, go out that night and look up. Hopefully, there will be no clouds. Cost $0, assuming you use your PC and Internet for other purposes, too. – J Birch</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I would disagree with those [readers] who suggest viewing the aurora borealis online. That would be about as satisfying as seeing Europe via a seven-day cruise ship tour. Sure, you'd be able to say that you “saw” it, but you will not have experienced it. Even here in rural Kanata (Ottawa), there are nights when we're out for an evening stroll, we'll be caught off guard by the appearance of the aurora and it never ceases to give me a kick in the pants, leaving us WOW!!-ed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– Garazgos</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've lived in the Yukon for 10 years, and although the lights are beautiful here as I'm sure they are in Yellowknife, they were just as beautiful in Northern Ontario and Northern Quebec. I remember stopping my car once on a drive between Timmins and Rouyn-Noranda because the lights were so spectacular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– C_Rogers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why not Saskatoon? Once, in January, returning from the University of Sask. about 9 p.m., I looked up as I got out of my car and started toward my front door, and was transfixed. When the cold had finally numbed my toes and sleepiness had overtaken me, I trudged inside. … I checked my watch. It was 2:30 in the morning.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is the value of a painful story? When the Oscar nominations were announced on Tuesday, many pundits noted the absence of dark or tough films such as Melancholia, Shame and We Need to Talk About Kevin, and suggested that this year's academy voters favoured work that was more “entertaining.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But isn't that an awfully narrow definition of entertainment? Aren't people as entertained by stories that frighten, sadden or move them as ones that please, amuse or lull them? People lined up to scream at Psycho, cry at Love Story, gasp at Chinatown. Pain is a fact of life, and to me, watching people struggle with it exercises our empathy and makes us feel more connected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which brings me to Tyrannosaur, the first feature written and directed by Paddy Considine, the British actor known for, among others, In America, Hot Fuzz and The Bourne Ultimatum. (It opened in select cities on Friday, and could win a BAFTA Award on Feb. 12.) Describing its story of an unlikely relationship between Joseph, an angry widower (Peter Mullan), and Hannah, an abused woman (Olivia Colman), requires the marketing-averse words pain, sorrow and rage. A dog is kicked, a garden shed is demolished, a man is murdered. But there's much more than darkness in it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tyrannosaur is based on a 2007 short, Dog Altogether, that Considine wrote and directed, which features the same characters and cast (and incidentally, won a BAFTA for live-action short). “But after I made it, it felt like the beginning of a bigger story,” he said in a phone interview last week. He sat down to write, and a week later – one week! – he had a finished script. “As if it was inside me needing to get out,” he says. “I suppose it's my testimony.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though it's not directly autobiographical, Tyrannosaur grew out of events and characters Considine witnessed growing up on a council estate (public housing) in the British Midlands from his birth in 1973 through the early 1980s. “We're talking about a lot of years as a kid digesting dialogue through doorways, and being subtly aware of abuse and things going around my community,” he says. “In that era, there were a lot of men who'd taken pride in their work, but had it taken away from them when their industries closed down. Grown men who wanted to be providing, but were marginalized and felt insignificant.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a lot of depression and alcoholism, but it was either tamped down and unacknowledged, or manifested in violence, Considine says: “Particularly men a generation before me, you don't admit to other men that you feel weak or depressed or sad. You wake up some days and want to cry, but it's a man's world, so you act like men. But if you display rage, if you destroy something physically with your hands, it seems intrinsically linked to being a man. It seems okay.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Considine's escape was art. He loved music, “lived at the cinema.” As a teenager, he took a drama course, then studied photography at Brighton University. “I found an outlet I could project it [emotion] onto,” he says. “I could print it onto a piece of paper, or capture it through a lens. That was quite a revelation to me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was searching for his Hannah when he met Colman, who was best known as a comedian in British series such as Peep Show and Rev., on the set of Hot Fuzz. “For some reason he thought I would be all right for it,” she says modestly, in a separate phone interview. “I loved Hannah the moment I read her. I didn't see her as a doormat or victim at all. I thought she was incredibly strong, and a soldier. She suffered such torment every day, but she still wanted to love others. I wanted to do her justice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“To play someone that multifaceted is the role of a lifetime,” she continues. “You dream of it, but you never get a script like that through the post. There was no way I wasn't going to try it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the 24-day shoot, Colman didn't want to rehearse the most difficult scenes. “I wanted it to be as fresh and real as possible, and Paddy understood that,” she says. “He'd say, ‘You don't have to say the words, just show the crew where you might want to go, so we can follow you.' ” As well, he never shot more than two or three takes of those scenes, “which was liberating, because you knew you could really go for it,” Colman says. “If you think, ‘I'm going to have to do this nine times,' you may hold back. Or by the eighth time, you can't cry any more. He knew that feeling.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working with Considine also changed people's perception of her: “I'm very grateful for my career in comedy, but I've always wanted to do drama, too, and now I'm getting those scripts,” Colman says. After Tyrannosaur wrapped, she played Meryl Streep's daughter in The Iron Lady. “Being in scenes with Meryl Streep, I can die happy now,” she adds. “There's no vanity, no ego. She would make everybody laugh, then go straight into it and do her thing, make people cry, then come straight out of it. She was just fun.” Colman did snort, though, when the crew referred to that film as low-budget. “I was thinking, ‘You haven't got a clue what low-budget is,' ” she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colman is currently rehearsing Noel Coward's Hay Fever in London's West End; later this year she'll appear in Hyde Park on Hudson, set in 1939, where she plays Elizabeth (the future Queen Mum) opposite Bill Murray as Franklin D. Roosevelt. (Yowza!) Considine is developing more scripts to direct. “Everything I've written since takes a bit longer than Tyrannosaur did,” he says, chuckling. For my final question, I ask each what value they find in painful stories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I can't describe that; people have to say for themselves what that is,” Considine replies. “I will say that a film that starts with a guy kicking his dog, and then 90 minutes in, has a woman say to him, ‘I feel safe with you,' and the audience believes it, I think that's a victory. Filmmaking should challenge people's perceptions.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colman, on the other hand, answers readily. “They show you that people have this extraordinary ability to survive, and to love,” she says. “The films that have stayed with me through my life have always been harder ones to watch. For two weeks after I saw Breaking the Waves, for example, I woke in the night and had to put cold water on my face, because I kept having dreams about it and crying. But it does more for your soul watching a film like that than something that's easy. The roughest scenes in Tyrannosaur, those were the ones I enjoyed doing most. Does that sound bonkers?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not to me. Not at all.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barack Obama has thrown down the gauntlet. The next U.S. election will be about equality and fairness. It will give Americans a clear choice between a country where “a shrinking number of people do really well while a growing number of Americans barely get by,” and one “where everyone gets a fair shot.” Time to apply the same rules from top to bottom, he said in his State of the Union address. “No bailouts, no handouts and no copouts.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We can all clap for that, I guess. Inequality has soared, and that should worry everyone. Trouble is, solutions are hard to come by. Raising taxes on the rich might be good, but it won't narrow the gap. So what will? Some people want massive investment in early childhood education for disadvantaged kids. Some want massive job-creation programs or increases in training for the unskilled. These would need vast amounts of public money, but maybe they'd be worth it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now comes Charles Murray to lob a grenade into this progressive wishful thinking. His new book, Coming Apart, to be released next week, argues that the most important gap between the upper class and what we used to call the working class is no longer economic or social. It's cultural.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As recently as the 1960s, he writes, people were united by a common understanding of “American values.” Just about everyone believed in marriage, two-parent families and hard work. But class values have dramatically diverged. “We have developed a new upper class with advanced educations, often obtained at elite schools, sharing tastes and preferences that set them apart from mainstream America,” he writes in The Wall Street Journal. “At the same time, we have developed a new lower class, characterized not by poverty but by withdrawal from America's core cultural institutions.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The differences go far deeper than a taste for Chablis versus two-fours. It's such basic matters as how you raise your kids and what it means to be a man.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To prove his case, Mr. Murray compares data from two fictitious neighbourhoods: Belmont and Fishtown. Belmont is an upper-middle-class suburb of managers and professionals with university degrees. The people who live in Fishtown have high-school diplomas and work blue-collar and low-skilled service jobs. (To simplify matters, he limits his analysis to the white population.) In 1960, nearly every midlife adult in both towns was married – 94 per cent in Belmont, 84 per cent in Fishtown. Today the marriage rate in Belmont is 83 per cent, while Fishtown has slid to 48 per cent. The same thing happened to nonmarital births. In 1960, just 2 per cent of all white births in the U.S. were to unmarried women. By 2008, the nonmarital birth rate among the well-educated women of Belmont had grown to just under 6 per cent. In Fishtown, it was 44 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter how loath we are to stigmatize single lower-class mothers, outcomes for their children are generally grim. As they are for men detached from the work force. In 1968, only 3 per cent of men in either Belmont or Fishtown were out of the labour force. By 2008 (before the recession), it had grown to 12 per cent in Fishtown, while in Belmont it hadn't changed at all. Mr. Murray says the main cause of high male unemployment in Fishtown is not scarcity of low-skilled work, but erosion of the work ethic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These trends are not as pronounced in Canada, but the patterns are the same. If you read The Globe, you (or your parents) probably live in Belmont. You may even belong to the notorious One Per Cent. It doesn't take all that much. A family income of $196,000 will do it, according to the current issue of Toronto Life, offering sketches of a few of these plutocrats. They're classic examples of bourgeois industriousness – well-educated, hard-working professionals and parents who, after childcare and mortgage payments, don't feel so rich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the top and bottom 20 per cent seldom cross paths. They raise their kids in different ways, send them to different schools, eat different kinds of food, choose different forms of exercise and recreation, take different kinds of vacations. The top 20 per cent include virtually all of the people who run governments, manage businesses and set social policies. But fewer and fewer of them know anybody in the bottom 20 per cent, or have much idea of how they think and live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This class divide has become self-perpetuating, argues Mr. Murray. One reason is that most people choose mates at the same educational level. “The formation of the new upper class has been driven by forces that are nobody's fault and resist manipulation,” he writes. “The economic value of brains in the marketplace will continue to increase no matter what, and the most successful of each generation will tend to marry each other no matter what. As a result, the most successful Americans will continue to trend toward consolidation and isolation as a class.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot of people aren't going to like this message. I don't much myself. But Mr. Murray doesn't conclude that the answer is to do nothing. His conclusion is that the inequality challenge is much more complicated than we think.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Dec. 13, 1933, Toronto Maple Leafs forward Irvine (Ace) Bailey – like Crosby, previously a league scoring champion – was run from behind by Boston Bruins defenceman Eddie Shore, the force of the blow fracturing Bailey's skull and instantly ending his hockey career.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So deliberate had been the attack, Boston police said Shore would be charged with manslaughter if Bailey died in hospital, but he recovered following the last rites and brain surgery. The league suspended Shore for 16 games, fully one-third of the then-season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Valentine's Day, 1934, a benefit was held for Bailey and his family. The Maple Leafs versus the stars of the other teams raised $20,989.40 – and the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> all-star concept was born, even if the league did not have its first official such exhibition until 1947.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bailey was a forgiving man, shaking Shore's hand at the benefit and saying, as it seems hockey players have forever: “It's all part of the game.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, perhaps it was, but no more. If brain injuries are indeed part of the game, at some point there will be no game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This weekend in Ottawa, head shots and what to do about them will be part of every meeting, whether or not the participants admit to it. Concussions have become the dominant topic since Crosby stopped playing more than a year ago, and then stopped again last fall after a brief return and seemingly little contact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While what is now known about head injuries alarms everyone in the game, it is what is not known that terrifies them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Crosby injury, NHL-leading goal scorer Steven Stamkos of the Tampa Bay Lightning says, was “the thing that made it go over the top.” If a concussion could sideline, perhaps forever, a player as skilled as Crosby or as tough as Philadelphia Flyers defenceman Chris Pronger, then it has made all players realize they could be next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Claude Giroux, a leading point-getter up until he was sidelined with a concussion, says it “is just the worst injury.” Seven of his Philadelphia teammates have been lost to the injury this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past three regular-season games, Giroux has worn a new helmet developed by <span class="companylink">Bauer Hockey Corp</span>. with the help of McGill University research. It is designed to fit snugly, yet have some flex in receiving the sort of glancing, angular blow that first felled Crosby during the 2011 Winter Classic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stamkos, too, is trying out the helmet, has worn it in practice and will wear it Sunday in the all-star game. He likes the look, likes the feel. Parents of hockey-playing children might not like the price – $219.99, facial protection extra, when it goes on market this spring – but if it is possible to have better protection for that lump of pink jelly that bounces around in the skull, it would be money well-spent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's not a concussion-proof helmet,” Bauer cautions, “because there is no such thing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">True enough, even the best equipment and the strongest suspensions will never completely take the dangers of concussion out of a sport where speed and solid substance will always be a characteristic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a great deal can still be done to reduce the dangers to an acceptable level – the current reality rather obviously unacceptable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giroux, only 24 and just coming into his own, talked about how remarkably terrible he felt during the handful of games he missed because of concussion. Even coming back, even with this newer, improved helmet on his damaged head, he cannot help but be aware of how fragile a hockey player's career can be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You don't want to think about it,” he says, “but I do.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so should every other person who cares about a truly magnificent game.</p>

Hockey Canada, an organization overseeing minor hockey, has received a request from its counterpart in the United States, USA Hockey, to ban fighting. Hockey Canada president Bob Nicholson responded in a curious way: “We want to remove fighting from the game, but we don't want to create other violent acts that may occur.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Hockey Canada truly wants to remove fighting, it should remove fighting (to paraphrase a TV commercial for a bank). Does it make sense to expose teenage brains to the high risk of concussions in fighting, on the ground that they would get a concussion from some other form of violence anyway? Of course not.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debate continues in Britain over whether and how Scotland should seek independence. Scottish separatist leader Alex Salmond wants a referendum in late 2014 that would propose degrees of independence. British Prime Minister David Cameron says any question should be a straight yes or no on complete independence.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In The Scotsman last month, a former military man said a newly independent Scotland would need a proper defence force, without which it “could leave itself open to blackmail by a terror group, especially with regard to North Sea assets.” In the same newspaper last October, Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney said Scots “should be able to take our decisions without the financial blackmail of the U.K. government.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ah yes, blackmail. As it happens, the language owes the word to the early Scots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Mail” is the Old English (and Scottish) word for rent or tax payment, from the Old Norse mal, which began life as speech or talk and later meant a contract or legal action. Tenant farmers would pay their rent in silver coins, known as white money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1500s, Highland freebooters began demanding that Lowland farmers pay them an additional fee for protection from other clans – or else. The coerced rent – Sir Walter Scott called it “a sort of protection money” in 1814 – became known as black money, or black rent. That is, blackmail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The play on “white money” may have arisen because the rent was paid with black cattle, or because those who didn't pay up had their goods seized and sold on the black market, or just possibly because black was associated with villainy. By the early 1800s, blackmail described any payment coerced by threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for freebooter – one who gets his booty free through the use of force – it comes from the Dutch vrijbuiter (vrij, free, and buit, booty). The same Dutch phrase gave us filibuster, which in the 1800s described U.S. mercenaries who incited revolution in other countries, and by 1889 had gained the political sense of a person who obstructs the work of a legislature to achieve his ends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But let's nip back to the Scottish referendum. In Britain's The Guardian on Jan. 18, Joan McAlpine said the Scottish Daily Record had criticized British Labour Leader Ed Miliband for supporting David Cameron on the referendum question. “The Record knows its readers,” she wrote, “and [knows] that Ed Miliband's fulsome backing of Cameron would be incomprehensible and offensive to the man on the Sauchiehall Street bus.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The word fulsome is itself becoming incomprehensible. As a recent string of letters in The Globe and Mail indicated, people can't agree on what the term means.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When fulsome began life in the 1300s, it meant abundant. That meaning gave way by the 1600s to a sense of tasteless, cloying, offensive excess, which is the meaning most reference books assign to fulsome now. In the 1980s, William and Mary Morris asked about 100 word lovers, including author Isaac Asimov and journalist Charles Kuralt, whether they would accept fulsome in a flattering sense. Eighty-four per cent said no. Asimov called it “one of my favourite criteria of illiteracy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many people, doubtless because of the sound of the first syllable (full), happily continue to use fulsome in a positive sense as effusive or copious. Last November's issue of Uncut magazine described musician Ravi Shankar as “sporting a fulsome white growth around his chin.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upshot is confusion. If someone receives fulsome praise, is she being heartily congratulated, insincerely buttered up or drowned in sickly syrup?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garner's Modern American Usage says the word “might justifiably be treated as a skunked term,” one that can't be relied upon to convey the intended meaning and is no longer of use. The Oxford Guide to Canadian English Usage reached the same conclusion: that the word “should probably be avoided.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody has taken the advice. The fulsome use continues.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a time when Rick Rypien was going to tell his story.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a couple of years ago, not long after the rugged Vancouver Canucks' forward had disclosed to team officials that he was battling depression and other symptoms of mental illness. The player thought that if he opened up about his problems, it might encourage others to seek help rather than suffer in silence as he had for so many years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rypien also felt that if the public saw one of the toughest players in the National Hockey League talking about a subject often associated with weakness and vulnerability, it might, in some small way, help reduce the stigma that has been linked with the disease for almost as long as it's been around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The player and the team decided the time wasn't quite right for him to talk about his problems. As it turns out, he was still dealing with them. But even those closest to him were not aware of just how desperate the player's situation had become.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Aug. 15 of last year, Mr. Rypien killed himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Word spread quickly throughout the hockey world. In the off-season, Mr. Rypien had signed with the Winnipeg Jets, so the news reverberated there. But it really hit home with the Canucks and their fans – Mr. Rypien had been with the organization for seven seasons. And among his former teammates, none mourned his loss more than defenceman Kevin Bieksa, who had become like a brother to the fallen player.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, Mr. Bieksa stepped forward in the name of his old friend to record a public service announcement that the Canucks used to relaunch a mental health and addiction website. In it, the star defenceman urges those who might be suffering from the disease to not stay silent, but instead “pledge” to talk to friends about the problems they're experiencing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The way Mr. Rypien had with him once upon a time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canucks donated $50,000 to help finance the website – mindcheck.ca – and insist this is not a one-off involvement. It will continue in the years to come in various forms. The website is interactive, and when you click on the icon RYP 37, it tells Mr. Rypien's story. The site has lots of resource material for those seeking help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canucks are honouring Mr. Rypien's memory through their involvement in a campaign designed to increase awareness dramatically of mental illness. And that says a lot about an organization that could just as easily have held a moment of silence at the beginning of the season and moved on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connie Coniglio, executive director of BC Mental Health and Addiction Services, says the Canucks' participation in the discussion of mental health issues is important.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Sports heroes, and in Vancouver especially the Canucks, have a strong social influence with youth and young adults who might not otherwise accept or pay attention to the messages we're trying to get out,” Dr. Coniglio says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Let's face it, there is a tremendous amount of stigma associated with mental health issues, and that stigma is very, very deep. On surveys we ask young people why they didn't seek help, what was holding them back, and the majority said: ‘I hoped it would go away on its own.' ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the younger members of Canucks fandom with whom health experts particularly hope to connect. One in five Canadians between the ages of 13 and 21 will experience a mental health disorder serious enough to cause significant distress and affect their ability to function at home, school, work or with their peers. The earlier someone in need gets help, the bigger the difference it can make.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Coniglio said an earlier iteration of the website got about 1,000 hits a week. In the two days since the re-launch of it with the Canucks, it's received more than 150,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canucks GM Mike Gillis said he learned a lot about mental illness talking to Mr. Rypien. He saw, up close, how devastating it can be. He understands now the many forms the disease can take, how there isn't a panacea, a cure-all to combat the many faces of the disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He appreciates how much courage it took for Mr. Rypien to come and talk to him about his illness. To pull back the curtains on his life and the terrible secret he'd been hiding from so many.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He was an amazing young man who was very troubled, obviously,” Mr. Gillis said. “We want to try and help anyone facing the kinds of challenges Rick had. We want to educate people, put our logo behind this and use it in the right way.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rick Rypien wanted to help others by sharing his story. The Canucks are making sure that still happens.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a winter's afternoon in London this week, hundreds of drizzle-dampened visitors tramped through the Royal Academy of Arts to look at pictures of the English countryside splashed out in splendid Technicolor. No trace of recession or tabloid racketeering in these stately galleries, just canvases the size of squash courts depicting the ebullient variation of nature's ever-changing seasons. The artist, of course, is David Hockney, and most of the people who've come to see him are (judging by the abundance of white hair and foreign accents floating around the place) retired art lovers on holiday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show is the city's hottest ticket of the year thus far, with attendance expected to beat last year's blockbuster show by a little-known Dutch painter named van Gogh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once a Pop Art renegade, today Hockey is generally regarded as a national treasure, and now, the “greatest living British painter” since the death of Lucian Freud. The public loves him. The critics, not so much. Generally, they wish he'd go away and let his “early stuff” speak for itself. The British press has described the exhibition as “overblown and corpulent” (The Evening Standard), “garrulous, gaudy and repetitive” (The Observer) and “the sorts of landscapes that we expect from amateur Sunday painters” (The Telegraph).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why are they all so cranky? Not because Hockney's work is controversial, but because it's not controversial enough. As one young critic recently put it, the works of the 74-year-old painter are generally perceived as “too polite and unthinkingly happy… if they offer a vision of Arcadia, it is a mindless one.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I may sound like a young fogey for saying it, but I thunderingly disagree. What's wrong with art that's technically proficient and openly pleasure-giving? His vision of the Yorkshire countryside in dazzlingly dreamlike colour is balm to my sun-starved expat soul. Give me these landscapes over dour postmodern minimalism any day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hockney is unrepentantly populist, but then so is his art-superstar rival Damien Hirst – now also showing his mass-produced “spot paintings” in London's Gagosian and in the gallery's 10 other locations around the world. Hockney made headlines earlier this month when he implicitly criticized Hirst for using assistants, pointing out his own works were all “made by the artist himself, personally.” And while the senior artist did sound a bit of a tiresome old crank for saying so, he does have a point: Today, Hirst's work feels sucked dry of humanity or relevance, while Hockney's still fizzes with exuberance for beauty, for nature, for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Hockney has taken a drubbing for the wrong reasons, he's being championed on other grounds. Since returning to his native England in 2004 (after four decades in sunny, seasonless California), he's suddenly been taken up by social conservatives hoping to use his popularity and stalwart commitment to landscape painting as proof positive that political conservatism is the answer to beleaguered Britain's problems. “David Hockney did not return to Britain after a long stay in the United States because he had been told that David Cameron would be the next British prime minister, but his arrival here nevertheless says something very important about the national direction of travel,” Peter Oborne wrote in the Daily Telegraph last week. “Appearance and reality are no longer identical. Good and bad are no longer indistinguishable. The Royal Academy matters more than Tate Modern.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, on the opposite end of the political spectrum, liberal commentators such as the historian Simon Schama and actor/writer Stephen Fry have lately taken to slagging Britain's other great recent cultural export: the quaint TV period drama Downton Abbey, which recently took home the Golden Globe for best miniseries. What could possibly be politically offensive about a bunch of charismatic actors swishing around a manor house saying things like, “Your quarrel is with my daughter and not me, so put that in your pipe and smoke it!” Well just about everything, according to Fry, who recently tweeted that hearing nice things about the series made him want to “puke,” and Schama, who wrote in Newsweek that a lingering “Jacobinical rage against the moth-eaten haughtiness of the toffs” from childhood prevents him from having any patience for the innocent American (and indeed Canadian) love of the classic English country-house drama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hockney (like Downton Abbey) evidently represents something quite different to his countrymen than he does to those of us from the other side of the pond. While abroad he's rightly recognized as a genius and an iconoclast, in Britain he's a former-rebel-turned-sacred-cow, returned home to enjoy the spoils of fame. Hockney certainly won't be the first artist misunderstood in his homeland, nor will he be the last. But he's the only one who can make my heart burst with an image of a hawthorn bush in bloom. And for this young fogey, that's actually saying something.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resignation of Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis as co-CEOs of <span class="companylink">Research in Motion</span> marks the end of an era not only for the BlackBerry maker, but ALSO for Canadian business. Their raw determination and unapologetic ambition, so uncommon among Canadian business leaders, transformed a small consulting company into a $20-billion global behemoth with an iconic brand sought after by presidents and movie stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lazaridis and Mr. Balsillie are inspirational figures for their technological innovation, and the fact that they built RIM into a global company, but also for the way they have worn the maple leaf on their chests. They insisted, for example, on basing RIM in Waterloo, and in the process contributed substantially to the creation of what has been dubbed Quantum Valley, an R&amp;D hub consisting of three communities and hundreds of high-tech companies.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they have used their personal wealth to invest heavily in personal passions with global benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lazaridis gave $170-million to establish the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, and $100-million to the Institute for Quantum Computing. Mr. Balsillie has taken on world politics and international relations, donating $20-million to found the Centre for International Governance Innovation, in Waterloo, and $50 million to establish the Balsillie School of International Affairs, and he serves as chair of the Canadian International Council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are tremendous gifts, and the payback, especially of Mr. Lazaridis's far-sighted ambition, will not be known for many years, but they do have the potential to profoundly alter our world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With respect to RIM, however, the ambition of Mr. Balsillie and Mr. Lazaridis has had its downside. RIM's fantastic success, which confirmed the duo's brazen bet on the completely new and untested technology of push e-mail, fed a culture in which they failed to recognize their fallibility, a not uncommon characteristic in highly successful people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lazaridis, an engineer who inspired his workers to achieve what many thought impossible, dismissed Apple's game-changing iPhone as a toy. Mr. Balsillie, whose professed belief in governance was so great he founded a think-tank around it, treated RIM's own board as a rubber stamp. Which is why, despite years of drift, disappointing devices and plummeting U.S. market share that slashed RIM's stock price by 75 per cent in 2011, it took until this week for the two to decide to step down. Most CEOs would have been long gone. And their replacements, Thorsten Heins as CEO, and former RBC executive Barbara Stymiest as chair, are not, at least according to RIM's sagging share price, what the market was hoping for. On taking the reins, Mr. Heins, RIM's former COO, dismissed the need for any “drastic change,” saying the company just needed a “bit more of an ear toward the consumer market.” But it will take more than that. The former <span class="companylink">Siemens</span> executive has inherited a conservative company, one much more at ease with incremental change than with radical innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RIM's story is by no means written, nor for that matter are those of Mr. Balsillie and Mr. Lazaridis. Despite the slings and arrows being directed at them, they never took the easy way out. They could, like so many of their Canadian colleagues, have sold out rather than take on giants like <span class="companylink">Nokia</span> and Apple. Instead, they proved a Canadian start-up could take on the world and win. And so, while one era may be over, it is to be hoped that another equally ambitious one for RIM, and Canadian companies inspired by their success, is beginning.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the olden days, you could just go to a theme park and spend the day gorging on cotton candy and trying to determine whether the carnies were sober enough to operate the rides. You didn't have to worry about national myth-making, or historical justification, or “the coolness of Napoleon.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coolness of Napoleon is what the French politician Yves Jégo hopes you'll find at a new park he'd like to build, which has already been dubbed Napoleonland. Mr. Jégo has many plans for his amusement park, to be built on the site of 1814's Battle of Montereau, where Napoleon's army defeated Austrian forces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who needs spinning teacups when you can have a slicing guillotine? The fall of the Bastille and the Terror that followed could be part of the amusement park, the former French government minister suggested. Mr. Jégo envisions visitors skiing through a re-enactment of Napoleon's catastrophic retreat from Russia “surrounded by the frozen bodies of soldiers and horses,” he told the Sunday Times. (Perhaps there could be an accompanying carnival game called “frenzied scrabbling for roots” where the prize is an edible boot sole.) “It's going to be fun for the family,” he said. The Addams family, maybe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jégo will announce more details of the park on Feb. 18, which is the 198th anniversary of the Battle of Montereau, but he's thought to have tacit backing from another pint-sized French leader with outsized ambitions. Let's not forget this is an election year for Nicolas Sarkozy, and what better time to remind voters that France was not always Germany's arm candy, but once ruled most of Europe? “As well as being an instrument of economic development, this is a question of rediscovering our roots and our history,” Mr. Jégo told The Times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governments have a knack for rediscovering national roots and histories at the most convenient times, usually when things are dire on the home front. It's a little like telling people to look out the rear window so they won't notice the land mine in the road ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was particularly obvious in England this week, where the one-time enemies of France were announcing a giant river pageant to celebrate the Queen's 60th year on the throne, a nod, as one of the organizers said, to the country's “great naval past.” So there probably won't be any reference to recent devastating cuts to the British Navy. And while we will see great vessels from the past, like Dunkirk rescue ships and Queen Victoria's yacht, it's unlikely that the flotilla will include HMS Oh My God the Debt's Hit £1-Trillion, or the noble frigate Carphone Warehouse Is On Fire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In our own country, the government is trying to sweep the dust of apathy from the populace with a $30-million broom, in order to remind us of the glory that was the War of 1812. That money will be spent on various remembrances of what the government calls “the fight for Canada.” This expenditure seems to fly in the face of evidence that people in Ontario only care a fig for this war, and westerners perhaps a 10th of a fig. Nevertheless, we must celebrate the victory Canada achieved over a bunch of grumbling, ill-equipped American militia. I say “victory” when I mean “draw” and “Canada” when I mean “colony of Britain,” but you know, you've got to colour outside the lines a bit when you're redrawing the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking of which, if your children are entering the 1812 poster competition sponsored by the government, remember that it was an inclusive military campaign, a magical time when French, English and First Nations fought for the same cause – the colonial war as Benetton ad. As Heritage Minister James Moore said, “participants are invited to create a poster showing how people from different backgrounds and regions joined forces to fight for Canada.” So, kids, use all the colours in your box.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I hope Napoleonland succeeds. After all, one man's tiny, dictatorial megalomaniac is another man's crusader for rights and democracy. There's nothing wrong with history as theme park, so long as it's labelled as such. You can already visit the Grutas Park in Lithuania, which is filled with giant statues of Stalin and Lenin, and where children can experience “holidays of the Soviet period” and wander under guard towers like so many little Ivan Denisoviches. But that park is intended to condemn the past, not celebrate it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So visit Napoleonland or Grutas Park and make up your own mind. Or, even better, hit the Jorvik Viking Centre in York, England, and take a ride back through history, where you will be sprayed with the authentic odour of Viking toilet. At least you know that's real.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transit planning in Toronto is a colossal, humiliating failure. It is hard to imagine how any city could make a greater hash of it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While other major cities from Taipei to Seoul to Madrid have rolled out vast networks of rapid transit, Toronto has fallen far behind. It is 34 years this week since the last extensive subway project opened: the Spadina line going north from Bloor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One new subway, on Eglinton West, was halted in mid-construction for lack of provincial funding. A hole was dug for a tunnel, then filled right back in again. Another project, the underused five-stop Sheppard “stubway,” dead-ends at a mall. A third, the rinky-dink, outmoded Scarborough RT, runs on vehicles that don't hook up to the subway system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto thought it had a new start with Transit City, mayor David Miller's plan to build seven light-rail lines along busy corridors such as Finch and Sheppard. But Queen's Park pulled back $4-billion in funding in 2010 and a newly elected Mayor Rob Ford cancelled it altogether at the end of that year. The Liberal government, fearing defeat at an imminent election, meekly acquiesced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now we have this staggering mess over the Eglinton-Scarborough Crosstown line. The original plan was to have it travel underground through the middle and above ground at the end, where the city is less dense. Mr. Ford insisted on putting it underground all the way, adding vastly to the cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has never taken that rash, unilateral decision to city council, despite clear wording in his memorandum of agreement with the province that requires the deal to be democratically approved. Now he faces a rebellion by councillors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His critics say that it makes no sense to dig a tunnel through the wide-open spaces of eastern Eglinton to carry light-rail vehicles that were intended to travel mostly above ground. If it's going underground, it should be a proper subway like all the other trains in Toronto that travel through tunnels. If it's light rail, go back to the original plan and put much of it on the surface. But the mayor is digging in his heels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the biggest infrastructure project in Canada is stuck in political gridlock. The mayor and the chair of the Toronto Transit Commission are butting heads. The provincial government is waiting for the city to get its act together, but refusing to take any leadership itself. The TTC, which is supposed to run the ruddy thing once it gets built, is complaining about being sidelined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a clown show of the first order. Who on Earth is in charge?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A city cannot act like this and expect to build a decent transit system. Rapid transit requires long-term planning, firm, consistent leadership and huge amounts of money. Cities that do it properly come up with a plan looking decades into the future and stick to it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto? Toronto plays politics, cancels projects in midstream, draws up plans only to rip them up and delays, delays, delays. It is no way to run a railway.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's something you crucially need to understand about the global economic crisis: It doesn't exist.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, Europe may be weeks from a monetary cataclysm that has the potential to crash all its economies plus some of the euro-exposed banks across the Atlantic. The United States may be suffering its highest poverty rates in half a century. And in Britain, the combination of high inflation and an economy that actually shrank last quarter may return the ugly word “stagflation” – stagnation plus inflation – to our vocabulary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that hardly constitutes “global.” If you live in Sao Paulo, Moscow, Mumbai, Shanghai, Mexico City, Jakarta, Istanbul, Johannesburg or a dozen other centres in the eastern and southern parts of the world, then your country hasn't been experiencing any kind of crisis, beyond a few rough months in 2008 and 2009. In fact, most have been enjoying a more or less continuous boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you view the world rather strictly through the lens of economic growth, you can paint a picture of neatly symmetrical rebalancing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was what I was told the other day by Jim O'Neill, the brusque Mancunian who runs Goldman Sachs Asset Management and is most famous for having coined the acronym BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) 10 years ago to unite the ex-poor economies that were becoming economic powerhouses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He remains a proud defender of his four-letter word. “I find it quite astonishing as I travel around the world, the amount of time that the conversation is completely dominated by Greece and this mess over in Europe,” he said. “China growing by a trillion dollars of GDP every year is effectively creating a new Greece every four months. … What happens to these guys is way more important than anything that's going on in Europe.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Neill has been in a rather triumphant mood in recent months, as his glowing prognostications a decade ago proved to be conservative: Growth in all four countries has surpassed all his forecasts; Mexico, South Korea, Indonesia and Turkey have done equally well, and several economies in sub-Saharan Africa have grown at a record pace. We reached a certain apex this past autumn when the BRIC countries made a serious proposal to provide Europe with a financial rescue package (fortunately for everyone, it did not happen). It is easy to imagine that the world has simply inverted itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what, actually, is happening? We need to get our metaphors straight. The world does not have a fixed pool of wealth that is simply sloshing over to the eastern and southern edges of the globe, leaving the West in the shallows. Nor is there a golden escalator taking the world's billion poorest straight from thatched huts to condo towers, without conflict in between.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, it appears – if you look beyond simple measures of gross domestic product and instead focus on the lives and household budgets of the newly non-poor – that many of these miracle countries are about to hit a BRIC wall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's fair to say that the world is now in the midst of a tumultuous in-between period. Before, we had several decades of unequal stability. The West consumed, the East produced, and the South did neither. The West had non-growing urban populations, the East and South had fast-growing rural ones. Most food was produced in a few highly developed areas, and the East and South could barely feed themselves, importing food.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some day we will have a more equal stability – when West, East and South will all have domestic consumption and consumer economies; when all will have urban, stable populations; and when agricultural land in Asia and Africa is producing food for sale, not housing people. We're in between those stabilities now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those three elements are changing at different paces, producing conflict. China, Russia and Brazil are urbanized with stable populations, but don't have much domestic consumption because wages are low and their economies rely on foreign-exchange earnings. India has a domestic economy, but remains rural, overpopulated and produces half the food it could. And its gross sexual inequality is hindering progress. Africa's growth and demographic improvement is pushed by agricultural and resource development, but Africa lacks urban economic growth and consumer economies, and won't have them until it invests in those things.</p>

Host Calgary saw native son David Zhang take first place, half a point ahead of Richard Wang of Edmonton. Shiyam Thavandiran of Toronto placed third. Those three scored 100 per cent against all the other entrants.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Advance Variation, characterized by White's third move, has risen from third place in popularity to parity with the traditional move, 3.Nb1-c3. For half a century, White wanted the light-square bishops gone, playing 4.Bf1-d3. Only about 80 years ago did White begin to have other thoughts about Black's only developed piece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4.Ng1-f3 e7-e6 5.Bf1-e2 c6-c5 6.Bc1-e3 c5xd4 7.Nf3xd4 Ng8-e7</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The circumspect 8.Nb1-d2, intending Nb8-c6 9.Nd2-f3, is of recent vintage, but White continues traditionally - if such a description can apply to a line younger than the junior players in the game - and aggressively against Black's centre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8.c2-c4 d5xc4</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diagram: This move was always rare, and has been getting rarer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9.O-O</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The literature of chess is full of games where castling is delayed too long and the king gets trapped in the centre. However, it is possible to castle too early; the theory of the late Elod Macskasy was that master-strength players tend to do just that. Grandmasters, of course, castle at just the right moment. White could easily put Black's position under a bit of pressure with 9.Qd1-a4+ (as played by Raja Panjwani - later the 2009 Canadian Junior champ - against Giorgi Margvelashvili - now a grandmaster - at the 2004 World Under-14 championship. Moving the b1-knight anywhere would also put a bit of pepper in the pot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9…Nb8-c6 10.Nd4-b5</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">White faced the need to counter the simple plan of Nc6xd4; Be3xd4 Ne7-c6. The only move that works in that regard is 10.Qd1-a4. To move the developed piece a third time is already too much of a compromise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10…Ne7-d5 11.Be2xc4 Nd5xe3 12.f2xe3 Qd8-b6 13.Nb5-d4</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">White may not have enough compensation for the pawn or pawns sacrificed after 13.Nb1-c3, but that was still a better try.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">13…Ra8-d8</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anxious to consolidate his gains, without compromising on king safety or neglecting to mobilize his pieces, Zhang underestimates a plan that does both: castling long and taking on d4. Black would then win a pawn and have the better position. For our putative grandmaster, this instance of castling would be tactical measure, preventing the counter-pin to which White now resorts:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">14.Qd1-a4 Rd8xd4!? 15.e3xd4 Qb6xd4+?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too mild. After 15…Qb6xb2 16.Qa4-b3! (to trap the queen if it takes on a1) Qb2xd4+! 17.Kg1-h1 Bf8-b4!, White must give up a lot of material to be left with not much of an attack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">16.Kg1-h1 Bf5-d3?! 17.Rf1-c1 Bd3xc4 18.Qa4xc4 Qd4xe5 19.Nb1-d2!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By defending against mate at h2, White roughly equalizes the prospects. Black could let the queen retreat to, say, b8, but takes on a more aggressive formation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">19…Bf8-d6 20.Nd2-f3 Qe5-h5 21.Qc4-b3</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">White missed the chance to apply the lightest of brush strokes with 21.Rc1-d1, making impossible the tactics which later arise. That would be a move of insight for a human, or rote exhaustive search for a computer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">21…O-O 22.Qb3xb7 Nc6-d4 23.Qb7-d7 Nd4-f5!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Black's retreat - the only way to save the game - contains a threat which White fails to parry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">24.Rc1-c8?? Nf5-g3+ 25.Kh1-g1 Bd6-c5+</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">White resigned. After 26.Rc8xc5 Qh5xc5+ 27.Nf3-d4 Ng2-e2+ Black wins. Whether through exaggerated relief at surviving the opening, or insufficient time to calculate, White missed 24.Kh1-g1!, when it would still have been anybody's game.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Feeling seriously down in the dumps during these short and gloomy winter days? You're not alone – about 15 per cent of Canadians are affected by some level of seasonal humbuggery. Some tips on how to banish the winter blues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Potatoes: Don't eat them and don't be one</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a person is suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder, they may feel the impulse to dive head first into a bag of potato chips. Mark Berber, assistant professor in the department of psychiatry at Queen's University in Kingston, says there are two reasons to resist this impulse. Stuffing yourself with junk food will likely bring on weight gain – never a good thing in terms of combatting depression – and you should be eating things that will help you to feel healthy and energized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Veggies, fruit, low-fat protein, basically all the stuff that is good for you is also good for fighting depression,” says Dr. Berber.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A person with SAD may also feel like curling up on the couch and laying low until Easter, but again, fight this urge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Getting out and exercising is invaluable in terms of fighting seasonal depression,” says Dr. Berber. “You don't have to be running miles. Really, anything that will get you out of your house and into nature will do the trick.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FILL YOUR CALENDAR</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether mild or more severe, SAD often feels like a chicken-or-egg scenario: Are you spending Friday night watching infomercials because you're feeling down, or are you feeling down because your social life revolves around a Slap-Chop? The problem is that once you arrive home in the dark, exhausted and freezing, it's hard to muster the energy to make plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Don't wait until the day of,” says Dr. Berber, who recommends setting dates and commitments with family and friends well in advance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This way you will feel obliged to take off the Snuggie and socialize. Consider your preferences: a book club, hockey game, cooking class or Pilates with some pals or a weekly family dinner date. The “what” doesn't matter nearly as much as the “who.” Nurturing connections may be harder when you are feeling down, but it is also one of the easiest (and most fun) ways to get you out of a funk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEE THE LIGHT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Light therapy is a simple and easy-to-execute alternative to antidepressants that has proven an effective cure in 55 per cent of SAD cases. So it's definitely worth a shot – especially since prices have come down recently. “You can get a decent machine for about $250,” says Dr. Berber, who recommends the bright light boxes over the machines that simulate the rising of the sun (try day-lights.com). They're easy to use (simply sit in front of the light for 20 to 30 minutes a day), and the response time is almost immediate. After using it for five days, you will know if it's working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MAKE WINTER YOUR BSF (BEST SEASON FOREVER…OBVIOUSLY)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A good way to combat negative associations is to pro-actively create positive ones. Maybe you think of December through March as a painful penance for patio season, but for others it's the much anticipated ski season. (Granted, slushy 2012 is, so far, leaving much to be desired on the slopes).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Taking up a winter hobby will help for so many reasons. You're outside, which is good for melatonin, you're exercising, which boosts endorphins, and chances are you're socializing, which helps with most forms of depression,” says Dr. Berber. If hitting the slopes is not your thing, consider skating, an outdoor running or speed-walking club, or even ice fishing, assuming you can find a partner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*And don't do this: Give up or feel like you're alone. ‘This condition is so common and so treatable,' says Dr. Berber.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NHL commissioner Gary Bettman on those cities that want an <span class="companylink">NHL</span> team: “We've told anybody in any market who's asked, who doesn't have a team, don't do anything planning on having a team because we're not making any promises on anything.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ray Chambers is the latest person to find out you cease to be an <span class="companylink">NHL</span> owner only when commissioner Gary Bettman and the governors say so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That became clear on <span class="companylink">NHL</span> all-star weekend when Bettman said Chambers may have made a deal several months ago with his co-owner Jeffrey Vanderbeek to cut his ties to the financially strapped New Jersey Devils but that means nothing in the eyes of the league.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are obligations [Chambers and Vanderbeek] may or may not have to each other and there are obligations they have to the league,” Bettman said. “He's still an owner.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So even though Chambers is said to turned over his 47.5 per cent of the Devils to Vanderbeek, who owns an equal share, with a $25-million (all currency U.S.) payment, he is not free and clear of the franchise and its severe financial problems. Vanderbeek has been scrambling for months to refinance an $80-million loan that went into default and find enough money to pay the Devils' big losses. But Chambers, whose share is held through a company run by his son-in-law Mike Gilfillan, cannot unload his interest without the approval of the NHL governors, Bettman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bettman's stance makes the Devils the most interesting team to watch over the rest of the season. Thanks to league rules, the bankers who hold the Devils' loan cannot foreclose until after the Stanley Cup playoffs are over but so far Vanderbeek has not been able to find any saviours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One person who is familiar with several people who would like to buy an <span class="companylink">NHL</span> team said one group who examined the Devils' finances told him they could see no way the team could break even let alone turn a profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bettman admitted the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> is giving the Devils money to stay afloat through advances on its share of league revenue, such as television money. But he denied the league, which already owns the money-losing Phoenix Coyotes, is subsidizing the Devils with any formal loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> advances cannot go on indefinitely. Someone has to be found to pay the freight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if Chambers thinks he won't be that someone, he should look no further than former Coyotes owner Jerry Moyes. He managed to sell the Coyotes to the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> through the U.S. Bankruptcy Court but is still facing a lawsuit from the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> for $62.4-million to cover the league's costs plus damages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bettman is using the league's consent agreement to hold Moyes's feet to the fire. Every owner who buys an <span class="companylink">NHL</span> team signs a consent agreement in which he agrees, among other things, to make sure his team has enough money to operate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fellow who's handled more than one of those consent agreements says they contain a nasty little bomb that can blow up an owner's bankroll. There is no cap on the amount of money an owner is expected to pony up for any losses, so legally the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> could bleed him dry if he can't sell the team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few owners who bought teams in recent years were smart enough to negotiate a cap into their consent agreements but there are a lot who don't have that protection. It isn't known if Chambers is protected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bettman says he is trying to get either Chambers or Vanderbeek to buy a majority share of the Devils if no owner is found. Since Chambers is by far the wealthier of the two, he is probably the preferred owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he is also a reluctant owner, which means another nasty court fight could lie ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRADE BAIT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WILL THOMAS STAY?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While <span class="companylink">NHL</span> all-star games are meant to burnish the reputations of the players, Tim Thomas might beg to differ. The Boston Bruins goaltender saw his persona as an unassuming everyman-made-good take a big hit with his ill-advised boycott of his team's visit with U.S. President Barack Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas claimed he made what amounted to a political protest because he feels all levels of government are “out of control.” But he couldn't seem to grasp the necessity of explaining his political beliefs once he made such a big splash with them. Then again, Thomas left the impression he isn't capable of explaining them in any detail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any event, the discussion soon turned to the goaltender's future with his team. That will depend on how Thomas performs over the rest of the season (he's been great so far) and how he is received by the home fans, not to mention his teammates. Backup Tuukka Rask has shown he can handle the No. 1 job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 37, with a no-move clause in his contract, Thomas will be difficult for Bruins general manager Peter Chiarelli to move by the Feb. 27 <span class="companylink">NHL</span> trade deadline. But that is less so on July 1, when Thomas's no-move rights expire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that point, he will have one year left on his contract with a $3-million salary (all currency U.S.) and $5-million cap hit. That would make him attractive to budget-minded teams that want to hit the salary-cap floor without spending the actual money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOSS RATTLES SABRES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One team to keep an eye on as the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> trade deadline approaches is the Buffalo Sabres. They are stuck in 14th place in the Eastern Conference with a general malaise lingering over a team that is costing owner Terry Pegula $65-million in payroll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Sabres president Ted Black issued a wake-up call while he was in Ottawa for the all-star game. He told the Buffalo News that no one among the team's most important players should feel comfortable. General manager Darcy Regier has the go-ahead to make any changes he sees fit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our commitment is to winning, not to any particular group of players that are labelled as a core. Take that for what it's worth,” Black said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That will keep the Ryan Miller trade talk boiling. The Sabres goaltender is having his worst season and 23-year-old backup Jhonas Enroth is outplaying him. While Miller says he doesn't want to be moved, Regier may decide to use Enroth and spend Miller's $6.25-million cap hit elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SUTER SITUATION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ryan Suter will be worth keeping an eye on thanks to a contretemps that blew up on all-star weekend. It started when the <span class="companylink">Nashville Predators</span> defenceman, who can become an unrestricted free agent on July 1, told reporters he would not sign a new contract with the Preds before the Feb. 27 trade deadline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some media outlets, who were surely not present when Suter made his remarks or didn't stay for his full explanation, jumped to the conclusion he plans to hit the open market come July 1. This would put pressure on Preds general manager David Poile, who also has to sign superstar defenceman Shea Weber, to make a decision whether or not to trade Suter and get something for him before losing him as a free agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that was not what Suter meant at all. He said he did not want to sign before the deadline because he did not want to be a distraction to his teammates. He made it clear he wants to stay in Nashville.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I love it in Nashville,” Suter said. “It's a great place to live and a great place to play.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He felt compelled to repeat those sentiments after he saw several media reports that implied Poile might have to trade him.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first Super Bowl was played in 1967. But the event truly began in 1969 when a charismatic quarterback from Beaver Falls, Pa., (via the University of Alabama) named Joe Namath put the event on the map. After guaranteeing a win, Namath's New York Jets upset the 17-point favourite Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III to seal the National Football League-American Football League merger and to make the Super Bowl the most powerful television property in America.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Tom Brady and before Tim Tebow, there was Namath, the first football player to wear both white shoes and pantyhose. Joe Willie. Broadway Joe. As the Super Bowl looms next Sunday, HBO has created a superb documentary on the first football player who loved the lens – and whom the lens loved back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Namath: Beaver Falls to Broadway documents the bittersweet life and times of the athlete who transcended his sport to become a media superstar in the 1960s and a <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> punchline decades later. Other jocks had tried (and failed) before to look comfortable in front of the camera, but Namath was the first to own it, doing movies, TV commercials and living large in New York with a twinkle in his eye and a beauty on his arm. He effortlessly mixed with Truman Capote, Ann Margaret, Howard Cosell and Bear Bryant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In later years, when drinking and depression got the better of him, Namath also provided one of the most cringe-worthy TV interviews of all time on Monday Night Football – and that's in the HBO film, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Namath had drunkenly slurred, “I want to kiss you” to interviewer Suzy Kolber. Kolber talks about it for the first time, and Namath owns the moment, talking about his battle with booze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The HBO doc shows Namath, as charming now as he was in his heyday, a 68-year-old rascal grandfather seated in his southern Florida home, spinning stories. “I liked my ladies blonde and my scotch red.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether embracing his playboy image or the litany of injuries that curtailed a brilliant career, Namath is honest, engaging and occasionally profound viewing. We “guarantee” you'll enjoy it.</p>

Whatever mileage we put on, we'll take off.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exit Gilles Duceppe – this time, apparently, for good.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The former Bloc Québécois leader thought he could restart his political career as leader of the Parti Québécois, but he now finds himself embroiled in a controversy over a news report alleging misuse of parliamentary funds – enough to cast a bit of a dark cloud over his image as the holier-than-thou White Knight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Duceppe, who was forced out of politics after his party's rout in the last federal election (he lost his seat by more than 5,000 votes to an unknown NDP candidate), was not a happy retiree. He had his eyes on the PQ leadership, but unfortunately for him, the position was occupied by Pauline Marois, who didn't intend to resign despite her poor standing in the polls and strong dissatisfaction about her within the party ranks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, Mr. Duceppe worked behind the scenes with his most faithful former aides to try and topple Ms. Marois. His inner circle approached several disenchanted “Péquistes,” focusing on left-wing dissidents who had already voiced their discontent with Ms. Marois. But it turned out that the call for rebellion fell on deaf ears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The “putsch” was rather clumsy and fizzled out only a few days after it began, putting an end to one of the nastiest episodes in the party's troubled life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody in the PQ – except two well-known trouble-makers who are long-standing opponents of Ms. Marois – took the bait and demanded her resignation. From their perch outside the party, several union leaders announced that they would soon go on the offensive against Ms. Marois, whom they accuse of not being an unconditional supporter of the unions. (She isn't, although like all Péquiste leaders before her, she is sympathetic to the labour movement, certainly more than Jean Charest's Liberal Party.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But – and this is the important point – not a single PQ MNA joined the tentative putsch against Ms. Marois. Even the riding executives, who had previously been critical of her leadership, kept silent. The MNAs and the party officials didn't want to live under the iron rule of Mr. Duceppe, who's reputed to be a ruthless and authoritarian leader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the second time in under five years that Mr. Duceppe had miserably lost a bid to become PQ leader. In 2007, after former PQ leader André Boisclair resigned, Mr. Duceppe vied for the leadership but quickly backed off when he realized that Ms. Marois had the support of the PQ caucus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, La Presse reported that under Mr. Duceppe's leadership, the Bloc used House of Commons funds intended for parliamentary purposes to pay the salary of a party official, who worked in Montreal, for upwards of seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As soon as this alleged scandal hit the news, Mr. Duceppe announced that he was quitting active politics to focus on, “defending my integrity and re-establishing my reputation.” He also maintained that the Bloc's allocation of House of Commons money was done “transparently” and with due respect for the rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This affair had at least one advantage for Mr. Duceppe: It provided him with a pretext to back off from his unsuccessful attempt to take over of the PQ leadership.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian health care costs have mushroomed by more than 260 per cent over the past 15 years to a whopping $130-billion in 2011, with an increasing portion financed by debt. Due largely to runaway health care costs, the provinces racked up a combined deficit of more than $30-billion in the 2010-2011 fiscal year. Health care already swallows more than half of revenues in Ontario and Quebec, and most other provinces will soon face the same debilitating prospect. And global fallout from the euro-zone crisis and U.S. economic lethargy is almost certain to reduce provincial and federal revenues.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What have Canadians been getting from this health care system that's slowly strangling public finances? The answer isn't pretty. The Fraser Institute's 2010 edition of “Waiting Your Turn” found the average waiting time between general practitioner referral and treatment from a specialist was 18.2 weeks. In a recent Macdonald Laurier Institute survey of 34 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, Canada ranked 26th in access to doctors and 24th in access to hospitals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If ever there were a time for major surgery on our terminally ill health care system, it is now. Yet provincial premiers who gathered in Victoria recently focused mainly on how they could extract more money from Ottawa to try to keep their sinking systems afloat (though there was some discussion about being “more efficient”).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Systems on the verge of a breakdown exhibit telltale symptoms. One is that the system thwarts those needed to save it. Canadian doctors consistently rank lack of operating-room time as the biggest impediment to treatment. Specialists see little point in taking on more cases when their surgical time is limited to a few hours per week, making waiting times for non-life threatening, but frequently debilitating, surgery painfully long for patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another symptom is that rationing becomes the only option. Many new doctors aren't able to obtain a residency due to what health care administrators call a “lack of resources.” This, while physician retirements, combined with an aging population, portend a doctor supply crisis. Perhaps if all patients waiting for treatment were to line up at their local hospital, the parallels to Soviet-style rationing would strike home with those who perpetuate the myth that Canada has one of the world's best health care systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2010 edition of the peer reviewed Euro-Canada Health Consumer Index shows that, despite having the fourth-highest per capita spending, Canadian health care ranks 25th compared with 33 European countries. While Canadian laws make it a crime for doctors to deliver, and for patients to pay for, “medically necessary services,” each of those 33 countries allows a mixture of public and private medical spending. They have found that dollars spent voluntarily for private care free up more money for the public system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the alarmist view that private treatment reduces resources within the publically financed system, how could that be true when new doctors can't even get into the system, and when surgeons wait for access to an operating room? Given these realities, it's understandable that those who can afford to escape the waiting lists and go elsewhere for private treatment – along with their money, which could be staying in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian system is expensive, but inaccessible. Our health care workers are high quality, but poorly utilized. Removing the Canada Health Act prohibition against private care would reverse the flow of money going to international hospitals, better utilize our excellent health care professionals, and foster job-creating investment in one of the world's fastest-growing sectors. The legal stipulation that all Canadians have access to government-financed health care would remain sacrosanct, while public system costs, along with waiting lists, would decline. It's time to move forward to a new, sustainable model for Canadian health care.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– Benjamin Franklin</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the revolution, each of the American colonies issued its own currency. When England moved to prohibit “colonial scrip” and impose English currency, it hastened the war of American independence. Americans have always taken skeptically the notion of a national bank. More than two centuries later, many of them still do. Indeed, the U.S. Federal Reserve, the country's fourth crack at it, has become a central issue of the presidential election campaign of 2012. The fundamental question is this: Can American democracy survive the Fed?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's past, it is said, is prologue. When treasury secretary Alexander Hamilton established the first U.S. national bank in 1791, he financed the venture by selling $10-million in common stock – the first $2-million reserved for the government, the remaining $8-million set aside for the public. The government didn't have $2-million, of course, a problem Hamilton solved in the usual central-bank way. He borrowed it from the bank (which had no funds) – and used the proceeds to buy the stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By all accounts, Hamilton did a creditable job. He established the First Bank of the United States as a private, profit-making institution. He prohibited it from buying government bonds. He required private shareholders to pay one-quarter of their investment in gold or silver coin. He required a prudent reserve ratio of 40 per cent. He required that the bank make loans to the government only on the collateral of its gold and silver reserves. And he required a weekly audit of the bank's books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chartered for 20 years of operation, Hamilton's prototype national bank survived the two-term presidency (1801-1809) of Thomas Jefferson, who passionately opposed such institutions as “a back door to monarchy, a vast, secret intricate power beyond the people's understanding and control, unconstitutional, centralizing and aristocratic.” Public resistance to it also remained intense. When the bank's charter expired in 1811, the bank expired with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second national bank, chartered for another 20 years, operated from 1816 through 1836; it proved criminally corrupt. A third national bank system supplied Abraham Lincoln with paper currency – greenbacks – to fund the Civil War. A fourth national bank, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>, arrived in 1913 with the dawning of the centralized state. It has survived for nearly a century – demonstrating, through boom and bust, why the American people have distrusted it so much for so long. It was, after all, a primary cause of the Great Depression in 1929 and a primary cause of the Great Market Meltdown in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he used his presidential veto to abolish the second of the four U.S. central banks, president Andrew Jackson – “Old Hickory” – listed three reasons why central banks expose democracies to unacceptable risk: (1) they concentrate too much power in a single institution; (2) they make countries too dependent on foreign debt – hence too dependent on foreign countries; and (3) they make the rich richer and the poor poorer. In 1835, incidentally, Jackson paid off the entire federal debt, the only president in history to accomplish such a feat. He championed “a plain system [of government], void of pomp, protecting all and granting favours to none, dispensing its blessings like the dews of heaven.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some ways, the presidential election now under way evokes the presidential election of 1800. The nation was deeply divided, the rhetoric rude and libellous. The incumbent Federalists wanted more government; the opposition Republicans wanted less. The most heated issue of the campaign: whether or not to end the Fed – and whether to bail out private banks with public money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historians now call the 1800 election “the bank war.” As a rearguard action, though, it persists to this very day. End the Fed, says Republican candidate Ron Paul. Audit it, says Newt Gingrich, “and find out who got our money.” Forbid the bailouts, says Mitt Romney. Even Barack Obama, who bailed out Wall Street financial institutions with low-interest, trillion-dollar loans, now concurs. It's populist politics for sure. But Jeffersonian democracy survives to fight another day – a democracy embodying, as Jefferson eloquently put it in his first inaugural address, “the soul of the nation.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's another option that Dennis Kendel, former registrar of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan, suggests, which is to report this psychiatrist – whose behaviour he labelled unconscionable – to the province's disciplinary body.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The doctor simply can't charge that,” Dr. Kendel, a family physician, said in a telephone interview from Saskatoon. “To actually apply it this way, when you have a one-time visit, is simply not on.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think most psychiatrists would be disturbed by this physician's behaviour. Maybe he thinks he's cornered the market on child psychiatry in your community – and maybe he has – but he's breaking the rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, patients are offered an option of paying a block fee for a set period of time, or paying à la carte for any additional services not covered by the public health-care system. No doctor can make it a requirement that a patient must pay a fee for an uninsured service as a condition for getting access to an insured service, such as psychotherapy for your child.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other rules as well. In Ontario, for example, physicians cannot charge a block fee for a period of less than three months, which means the psychiatrist could not bill per visit. Patients must also be provided information about what the block fee covers so they can decide how and whether they want to pay. The fee must also be reasonable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that Ontario psychiatrists are paid about $160 for each therapy session – British Columbia and Nova Scotia are about the same at $161 and $163 respectively – another $60 on top would not likely pass the college's reasonable test.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think you should make an appointment with your family doctor. Thank the physician for the referral to the psychiatrist but say you cannot afford the $60-a-visit fee. Give your doctor time to respond – don't be afraid of the long, silent pause – as it's a lot to take in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Request another referral to a similarly qualified specialist, recognizing that it can be difficult. See if there are other health-care providers covered by medicare that can help your child while you wait for that new referral. Ideally, you want your family doctor to help you stickhandle your way out of this health-care jam; the physician holds the golden key that gets you into that world of medical specialists.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How do I know for sure whether I am suffering from a cold or a flu?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was home sick two days this week, and even though I had my flu shot last week, I felt pretty darn fluey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is there a key symptom to distinguish between the two?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard to tell sometimes between the cold and the flu as they are both respiratory illnesses caused by viruses. While they can share similar symptoms, in general the flu is much more severe than a cold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colds usually have a gradual onset over one or two days with symptoms such as runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and mild fever. Symptoms generally last a week to 10 days, although a residual cough or runny nose can last for a few weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To compare, flu symptoms can come on quickly within a few hours, knocking you off your feet due to the key symptoms of fatigue, weakness, aches, headache and high fever (above 38.5 degrees C). While the flu generally lasts just a few days, the fatigue and exhaustion can last a few weeks after the initial infection has resolved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although you received the flu shot last week, it can take up to two weeks after immunization to develop protection against the flu so it is possible that you may have indeed had the flu. While the shot is one of our best defences, you can still get the flu – but generally it is much milder than if you had not had the immunization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless of whether you have a cold or the flu, treatment for both is based on managing symptoms, rest and hydration. For those at higher risk of complications from flu such as the elderly, young children or those with</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">compromised immune systems, antiviral medication can be prescribed. Antibiotics do not play a role in treatment of either the cold or the flu as they will generally run their course with good rest, hydration and symptom relief.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kay MacBeth takes pills for high-blood pressure and pushes a walker to get around after fracturing her pelvis. She drives her own car and on Wednesdays can be found practising with the Heartstrings, the Evergreen Seniors Club string band for which she strums baritone ukulele.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don't know how much longer I'm going to play,” she said. “It's getting a bit too much for me to drive that thing around, to get in the car and get my walker out.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time eventually denies us our greatest pleasures. Mrs. MacBeth has been a widow now for 15 years. She long ago gave up sports, even golf, a rare activity in which skill can compensate for the ravages of age. \More than seven decades ago, when she was a fresh-faced schoolgirl graduate in Edmonton, she was invited to join the storied Edmonton Grads, the greatest women's basketball team the world has ever seen. The Grads played more than 400 official games, losing just 20, according to M. Ann Hall's definitive account of the team, The Grads are Playing Tonight!, published recently by the University of Alberta Press.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 1922, when the Grads first won the Dominion championship, until 1940, when the club disbanded, the Grads used just 38 players. That roster is now down to just two survivors – Edith (née Stone) Sutton, 101, of Edmonton, and Mrs. MacBeth, 90, of Comox.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Young Kay MacRitchie, as she was known in 1939, leapfrogged from a junior team to the Grads, becoming the first Grad not to first compete with the Gradettes feeder team, according to the new book. The spectacular rookie worried about how her new teammates and the overlooked Gradettes would react.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was only 17,” she recalled. “I felt they'd be angry at me, because they'd played for quite a few years. I was excited, of course, but I didn't show it. I was the youngest. The next closest to me was five years older. I was scared to say anything, or do anything, but I gave it all I had when it came time to play.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She had grown up playing dodgeball in Saskatchewan and only learned basketball in Grade 10.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She developed a sharpshooter one-handed shot, but Grads coach J. Percy Page, who was soon to be elected to the Alberta Legislature and later served as lieutenant-general, thought it unladylike to use anything but a two-handed shot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was fast and I was a better dribbler than most,” she said. “I called myself the Court Master. I'd rather make a pass than take a shot.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unmarried, still living at home while working as a government clerk, she helped the Grads continue their enviable record as holders of the Underwood International Trophy. The cup, donated by the typewriter company, was awarded for the winner of the competition pitting Canada's best against teams from the United States. In Mrs. Macbeth's two seasons, the Grads defeated challengers from Chicago; Cleveland; St. Louis; Des Moines, Iowa; and Wichita, Kan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Grads won their final Canadian championship in May, 1940, when low attendance and the demands of the war caused the amateur club to cease operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When her parents moved to Vancouver, she went with them to join the local Hedlunds basketball team for a few seasons, while also playing softball in summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1946, she married long-time beau Ross MacBeth, who had spent four years overseas as a Royal Canadian Air Force pilot. The pending marriage forced her to turn down a chance to play semi-professional baseball in Arkansas. She raised a family and settled in the picturesque Comox Valley on Vancouver Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, the feats of the amazing Grads faded from memory. Few remember a team once heralded for many years as world champions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I went to Edmonton in '33, everybody knew the Grads,” she said. “Hardly anyone knows them now.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Grads exhibited their prowess as far afield as Europe decades before women's basketball debuted at the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. MacBeth was the penultimate player to join the Grads, a teenager among seasoned veterans who'd lived the team's previous glories. They are gone now and it is left to a rookie to tell the stories of departed legends.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some say people are talking about Fran Drescher, who used to star in The Nanny. She has asserted that she was abducted by aliens in her youth. That would account for the otherworldly monstrosity that is her laugh. Some say we're never meant to grow up, as a song by Sum 41 reminds us. Never. Mind. These are the hot TV topics right now:</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One: Downton Abbey. It must gnaw at the nobs who run the U.S. networks that Downton Abbey gets such vast attention. “Dress like the ladies of Downton Abbey” is one headline I saw online. On another site there was a discussion about the home leave given to English soldiers during the First World War – could Downton's plotlines be getting it right? And then there was the fuss about a Downton Abbey-inspired line of jewellery being flogged by PBS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A “Lady Mary knotted pearl necklace and earring set” ($184.99 U.S.) was being sold by ShopPBS.org last week. But no more. The British production company was annoyed, so only officially endorsed bling is now flogged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downton Abbey is PBS's most successful show in decades. The loyalty of viewers is intense, the curiosity about the world of Downton is immense. This for a semi-sophisticated romantic trifle, with absurd plotlines. Perhaps people can't stop watching because there is nothing as peerlessly sexy as Lady Mary slowly having her heart broken, just dying inside. Whatever. How many shows can sell bling?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two: The Academy Awards. The talk on this topic is divided into two camps: 1) Oh, no, not this tedium again, and 2) Jeez, how can the Oscars be made better? The commitment of the latter camp can be interpreted as a commendable wish to speak well of the dead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reality is that a good portion of the population, if it thinks at all about the Academy Awards, dwells on the prospect of Billy Crystal hosting it, with absolute dread. Indeed, poets in search of new metaphors to illustrate the feeling of soul-destroying unease would be well recommended to dwell on the Academy Awards for material.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three: David Letterman. It has emerged that Letterman is, this week, celebrating 30 years in late-night TV. Late Night with David Letterman premiered Feb. 1, 1982, on NBC. What are people saying about this? Not “how time flies when you're having fun.” More likely, if anyone cares at all, the benign observation is that it's nice to see cantankerous old codgers still working. But really, the gist of conversation on this matter is that Letterman (and Leno) have been irrelevant since Jon Stewart got into his stride on The Daily Show and started mocking the bejeepers out of politicians and the media nightly, and with gusto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four: The CBC. Well, as usual, there are two camps on this topic too. First there's the usual “shut it down” cant, largely rooted in total ignorance about what the CBC actually does. Second, there's people wondering if the CBC has not put itself in a strong position, with funding cuts looming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other day, CBC issued a press release to say, “The CBC has been ranked among a newly released study of the Top 10 most influential brands in Canada – and it is the sole broadcaster on the list.” Apparently the Ipsos Reid study showed that CBC ranked sixth overall, on a list of brands that included <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> (at No. 1), <span class="companylink">Google</span>, President's Choice and Apple. This is peachy, but name recognition does not automatically translate to satisfaction with the brand. It could be that the CBC-haters know the brand all too well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, some people are bound to be asking, “Why's everybody watching CBC?” The broadcaster had a very strong January, with five shows hitting the one-million-plus benchmark in the Canadian ratings – Marketplace, Mr. D., Arctic Air, Dragons' Den and Republic of Doyle. And several others are close to hitting the one-million-viewers mark – the fifth estate, Heartland, Redemption Inc. and The Rick Mercer Report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nice, but of little value. After hockey, Canada's favourite sport is going online to goad the CBC and its supporters. It's not a fad, a trend or a conspiracy, it's a national sport, I tell you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five: The Super Bowl. Some people are talking about the fact that Fox is charging $3.5-million (U.S.) for a 30-second ad during next weekend's game. And specifically positioned ads are reportedly going for just over $4-million. Others are talking about the potential audience reach of this year's Super Bowl – will it be more than 100 million viewers this year?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yeah, yeah, whatever. Smart people are talking about what the Super Bowl brings in attendant programming. Specifically, Puppy Bowl VIII (Animal Planet, Feb. 5, 6 p.m.). Animal Planet calls it “that classic combination of terrier touchdowns, puppy penalties and fido first fumbles.” And rightly so. Watching puppies carry a chew toy across the goal line is splendid entertainment and thoroughly good for the soul. Talk about that.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Tamils, the end of Sri Lanka's civil war has brought no peace dividend; for Tamil women, peace has brought with it a continuation – and in some cases an intensification – of violence and insecurity. In the predominantly Tamil-speaking north and east – a region half the size of Nova Scotia – tens of thousands of “war widows” have been living under the control of the central government and Sinhalese security forces since 2009 and the end of the civil war, whose last few months saw as many as 40,000 civilians killed.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been an alarming increase in gender-based violence, including domestic violence, within the Tamil community, as well as forced prostitution and trafficking. All of this is against a backdrop of credible evidence of wartime sexual violence by government forces, including video footage showing soldiers making sexual comments while handling dead, naked bodies of female suspected Tamil Tiger fighters, some with their hands bound. At the UN Human Rights Council session opening late next month, there is a chance to finally ensure accountability and to address the current state of insecurity; Sri Lanka and the international community, including Canada, should take it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To date, the government's response has been to deny the existence of threats to women's security – past or present. Sri Lanka's ambassador to the U.S. recently claimed that there is “no discrimination for women in Sri Lanka” and reduced the existence of rapes to a “couple of cases,” while a military spokesman said there was no “insecurity issue” for women in the north and east. This would come as a surprise not only to the women and girls from that region who have been victimized over the past three years, but also to women across Sri Lanka who have seen increasing gender disparities in income and higher education, as well as many recent cases of murder, rape and sexual harassment in the south by current and former security force members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These government denials should also be a red flag to anyone wanting to believe that Sri Lanka's Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission – whose long-awaited report to President Percy Mahendra Rajapaksa was made public in December – represents a change in the regime's approach to accountability and reconciliation. The government has already shown no compunction in ignoring the LLRC's finding that women in the north and east “feel unsafe in the presence of the armed forces,” and, given past performance, there is every likelihood it will disregard the LLRC's sensible recommendations on governance, land issues and a political solution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, any positive outcomes that could flow from the LLRC report will likely remain theoretical, given that the report failed to provide a thorough and independent investigation of alleged violations of international humanitarian and human rights law in the final stages of the war, as demanded by the UN and others, including Canada. From the beginning, the government hamstrung the LLRC by giving it a feeble mandate, choosing pro-government commissioners with clear conflicts of interest, and failing to provide any witness protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The LLRC's report accepts at face value the largely unexamined claims of senior government and military officials who planned and executed the war, fails to adequately address credible allegations detailed in last April's report of the UN Secretary-General's panel of experts on accountability in Sri Lanka, and rolls back established principles of international law. In the end, it works to exonerate the government and, in so doing, undermines its own limited calls for further inquiry, including a call for yet another government investigation of the above-mentioned video footage, which officials repeatedly have described as “faked.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is, however, an opportunity to address Sri Lanka's entrenched culture of denial and impunity – including for crimes against women – at the upcoming session at the UN Human Rights Council. Canada has already played an important role in recent months by reminding the world about the need for accountability and justice in Sri Lanka. Now is the time to put their principles into action in Geneva. Canada should take a firm stand, working closely with the United States, Britain, other members of the European Union and, African and Asian states – especially India – to make sure this marks the beginning and not the end of a real accountability process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a minimum, there should be a formal dialogue at the council to discuss both the LLRC and UN reports, to ensure that the full range of credible allegations of war crimes, and the deficiencies in domestic accountability processes, are addressed openly and in detail. It is essential that the council remain seized of this matter and mandate a high office – such as the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights – to monitor and assess the Sri Lankan government's implementation of the LLRC's recommendations and any further accountability efforts. Finally, Canada and other HRC members should be prepared at this June's session to endorse an international inquiry, absent a truly credible domestic accountability process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the international community seeks, laudably, to recommit itself to the protection of civilians in armed conflict, it needs to reflect seriously on what happened in Sri Lanka: arguably one of its greatest single failures to provide even a modicum of safety to hundreds of thousands innocent victims of war. If the opportunity is again missed to provide some form of accounting, the sustainable peace that all Sri Lankans deserve after so many decades of violence will be only further out of reach.</p>

The digital revolution is poised to transform Canadian health care – whether hospitals are ready for it or not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Women's College Hospital in Toronto, a small number of patients enjoy this convenience as part of a pilot project. They take photos of their surgical incisions on smartphones and answer questions during the 30-day postoperative period, in which they are connected to surgeons who view the information on tablets.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Nain, the northernmost town in Newfoundland and Labrador, a remote-presence robot, operated by physicians in Goose Bay, has been used 177 times to do consultations, including emergencies. Until a year ago, the only option was to fly these patients to a Goose Bay hospital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's unstoppable,” said Ivar Mendez, a neurosurgeon who is chairman of the Brain Repair Centre, a Dalhousie University and Halifax hospital-affiliated institute of researchers and physicians who are creating groundbreaking treatments and technologies. “This is going to democratize health care, because it's going to provide access.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A case in point: The Andean region of Bolivia has little water or electricity and few doctors or nurses. What it does have is a cellular signal. As a result, physicians such as Dr. Mendez can hear a baby's heartbeat in a remote mountain community in South America from his Halifax office through a digital stethoscope. He can also perform prenatal ultrasound assessments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I believe this technology will narrow the gap of inequality in Canada and in the developing world,” he said. “This is an amazing thing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hospital staff and administrators who are on the front lines putting out fires may think they have no time to set aside for adaptation to the digital revolution. But they are mistaken if they think they have a choice. This is a make-or-break time for Canadian medicare. Innovation – rather than more money – holds the promise of the rescue of public health care.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE QUESTION</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a previous column, you mentioned “endurance” training, “strength and hypertrophy” training and “power” weight training. What do those terms mean?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ANSWER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Muscular endurance is the ability of a muscle to repeatedly exert force over a period of time, and to build muscular endurance you should do sets of 12 to 20 repetitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Muscle strength is the maximum amount of force that a muscle can generate. The body adapts to this type of training by increasing muscle size. This muscle growth is called hypertrophy. To build strength, do sets of six to 12 reps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Muscle power is the explosive aspect of strength. To build power, do sets of one to five repetitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terms like “endurance” training refer to specific repetition ranges. The rep range dictates the weight that is used. The amount of weight that is lifted and the number of reps determine the training results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone will adapt to training in the same way. One's genetics, gender, exercise history, nutrition and recovery will affect training results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most women, for example, do not have the genetics to build serious hypertrophy from strength training.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often people make the mistake of thinking they are using a weight appropriate for a particular rep range, when actually the weight is too light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, people often use a weight appropriate for an “endurance” rep range when they think they are working within the “strength and hypertrophy” range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While lifting, if you choose to stop after 10 reps, as opposed to having to stop because of muscle failure, the lift will not lead to full strength and hypertrophy gains. If you are trying to build strength and gain muscle size, the 10th or 12th rep should be the last one you can do with good form.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trainer's Tip</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are new to lifting weights, I suggest one to six months of endurance weight training before starting heavy strength or power training. This introductory phase will help you learn proper lifting techniques, and allow your connective tissue to adapt.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Happiness would make for boring theatre.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It lacks drama and size, and has no sharp edges. Far better to work with a more extreme emotion, something that jumps out at you and demands to be understood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what Toronto's Maxine Heppner began thinking about five years ago, when introduced to contemporary Japanese comics. She had long been aware of the ancient art of manga, but hadn't taken much interest in the pop culture version. “And when I saw them, I was struck by the energy that comes off the page, that comes out and meets the eye.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was also intrigued by the way a book of them is an act of containment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is this benign little volume of paper, sitting there on a shelf,” she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You open it and go ‘wow' and then you can close it and the emotion of it goes away,” says the award-winning dance artist, director and teacher in a phone interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An idea for the exploration of a human condition – a big, raw emotion we hold inside and only periodically let out – began to percolate. “The idea of rage is extreme anger. I don't think of it as the opposite of happiness. That would be sadness, which has no energy and is a deflation. Rage is in a different realm. It's extreme, like ecstasy. And I wanted to look at it in all its complexity.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I thought about rage as the inspiration for art when I sat in the darkened theatre to see Ms. Heppner's latest production, My Heart Is a Spoon. It's well known from happiness studies that a sense of contentment makes us more productive at work and better citizens who want to volunteer and contribute. But does it help create art? I know many creative people – writers and artists – who feel that their discontent is the engine of their work. Friedrich Nietzsche would agree: “You need chaos in your soul to give birth to a dancing star,” he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heppner's play takes place in a simple, white box of a stage set, onto which large manga cartoons and other images were projected. Two characters, a male and a female, one young, one older, offer different respond differently to their contained rage. Created in collaboration with light artist Fujimoto Takayuki, the theatrical environment is surreal, flooded with visions of fantasy, memory, fear and longing. The female character, performed by Takako Segawa, is constantly moving, writhing on a large ball, unsettled, whereas the older male character (Gerry Trentham) is more self-contained. Part of his expression of rage comes out in the creation of small, origami tigers, which litter the stage at the end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's an interesting investigation of an emotion often seen as something to avoid, repress – almost shameful in the largeness of its expression. We condemn it when we speak of road rage, the rage of a parent directed at a child, of one spouse raging at the other. We're a culture obsessed with happiness, eager to achieve a peaceful, serene state, still as a pond, a lack of drama. We praise and desire the positive. But what Ms. Heppner, who has spent 30 years in theatre exploring human reaction and interaction, sets out to do is show how rage should not be feared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the creative process, she convened a “rage roundtable” with people who had experienced the extreme state (often characterized by a sense of injustice) as well as psychoanalysts. “It's not an absence of happiness. It's just this moment of extreme pressure. It's energy condensed, like a little time bomb. It can vent very slowly. It can implode inside itself. Or it can explode. Something has to happen with the energy of it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And surprisingly, that can be good. “I think we have to face these things,” Ms. Heppner says. “If we ignore them, it's not good. These strong emotions are intense. It's more practical to recognize it, because then you can integrate it into your life, the same way we do with grief over a loved one.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One revelation came while interviewing Hiroshima survivors who discussed how they coped with feelings of rage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We were talking about what went on in Hiroshima and the aftermath of [the Second World War] in Asia Pacific. We found out that the Japanese government directed survivors [of the atomic bomb] to ‘swallow your anger' if I can paraphrase. They had fought the war and lost, and there was this unimaginable destruction of people and geography. And I thought about that. If you swallow it, you digest it, and then it becomes something else. There's potential for the positive. The possibilities are endless. If it explodes, it's over and destruction is involved.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The metaphor of the spoon helped explain the condition. “People spoke about feeling empty or very full. How do you live with nothing inside of you or with too much inside of you?” she asks rhetorically. “And the nature of a spoon is that it's made to be emptied and filled, emptied and filled, pouring self-administered or force-fed sensations of hot, cold, sweet and sour into our bodies.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I thought about that as I exited the theatre – it, too, a containment of sorts, a closed space apart from the dark rush of evening traffic, where we are asked to confront truths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neil Munro, the late Canadian director at the Shaw Festival, once described theatre to me as “a signpost” for navigating daily life. We should take this direction I thought – that rage is a life force, not be ignored, dismissed or spat out, a state that can lead to greater understanding of who we are and, ultimately, to what we must resolve, what we must digest, to find peace.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Way back in 1996, a rising young Ontario backbencher explained why premier Mike Harris was moving so quickly to implement his conservative agenda.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We can't put things off, because we'll get too close to an election and we'll lose our nerve,” Tony Clement said. This is why Stephen Harper has chosen now to launch the most ambitious economic plan in two decades: cutting back on the Old Age Security program even as Mr. Clement, now Treasury Board President, slashes public spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simply put, the Prime Minister, who has never had the luxury of a majority government before, has a year-and-a-half left to be bold before the ticking of the election clock drowns out everything else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is what we are going to see in the coming weeks, after Parliament resumes Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• a budget that balances the books in two or three years;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• departmental spending slashed by upward of 10 per cent in order to achieve that target;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• major reforms to the immigration system, with a big push to bring in skilled workers who speak English or French, at the expense of reuniting families;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• passage of the bill to create pooled retirement plans for workers who currently don't have pensions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most contentious of all, the government plans to raise the age for receiving the Old Age Security pension supplement, probably from 65 to 67.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The need for it is quite clear,” Government House Leader Peter Van Loan said in an interview. The cost of the plan will triple over the next two decades if nothing is done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a question of having it sustainable over the medium and long term,” Mr. Van Loan maintained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Brian Mulroney and Jean Chrétien vetoed proposals to reform the OAS, fearing the political cost. Susan Eng of the Canadian Association of Retired Persons is already at battle stations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Increasing the age for OAS right now is the wrong thing to do at the wrong time,” she said Sunday on Global TV's The West Block. “They can find the money elsewhere.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In hoping that any blowback from raising the OAS qualifying age will dissipate long before the next election, the Conservatives may want to bear in mind Brian Mulroney. He introduced the GST in 1989, soon after winning his second mandate. Voters still hadn't forgiven the Tories four years later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Harper brings forward his proposals against a backdrop of a Europe riddled with bankrupt governments and economic decline. The Cameron coalition in Britain is slashing spending far more drastically. The U.S. system is paralyzed even as federal finances spiral toward a crash. And Japan? Don't go there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian voters are among the most economically literate in the world. They may be prepared to sacrifice now to avoid becoming any of these countries later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is, of course, the political calculation, as well. The Tories hope that cutting spending and tightening pension requirements will cement in voters' minds the conviction that only Conservatives can be trusted to keep the books in the black.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the government can further insulate itself by making sure the new rules apply only to those many years from retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, this is the farthest the Conservatives have ever gone toward reform. Such a politically risky step is “courageous,” as Sir Humphrey used to say on Yes Minister when he meant “suicidal.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No government has tried anything this bold, or risky, since Paul Martin vowed to slay the deficit “come hell or high water.”</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of leading with the fact YVR, named the best airport in North America, was going to spend $1.8-billion upgrading and modernizing to stay at the head of the pack, the media mostly focused on a much smaller detail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The airport-improvement fee at YVR will jump from $15 to $20 in May. That's a hefty increase and headline writers knew it would not sit well with travellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Vancouver airport fee jumps to $20 to pay for upgrades,” trumpeted CTV on its website. “Vancouver airport improvement fees going up,” echoed CBC. “Vancouver airport hikes departure fees 33 per cent” said the Toronto Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improvements to terminals, the new high-speed baggage-handling system, the safer, extended runways, the dedicated walkway to make it easier for international-domestic connections – all of that was secondary to the $5 spike in what the Richmond Review called the “now hidden, but always hated” airport- improvement fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Richmond Review, the leading paper in the municipality where YVR is located, might have been expected to praise the airport for its expansion plans, which, after all, will mean more local jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the paper, like most other media outlets, was more concerned with the immediate impact of the fee hike on air passengers. “Yet again, the upgrades will be borne on [the] backs of already beleaguered Canadian taxpayers,” stated the newspaper, which warned that people might respond by taking their business elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Some people already choose to use Seattle as their airport for vacations. … Could this additional $5 be the straw that breaks the proverbial camel's back?” the paper asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a fair question and indeed Mr. Berg raised it himself when he announced YVR's spending plans in a luncheon speech to the Vancouver Board of Trade. “I know none of you would ever go to Seattle or Bellingham. But some of my neighbours would,” he said, after saying the airport-improvement-fee hike was fair because it merely put Vancouver in line with other major airports in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's true. Most Canadian facilities charge airport improvement fees of $20 to $25 and have done so for some years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But nobody likes the fee, and increasingly Canadians are turning to U.S. airports for cheaper flights. In a report last year, the Hotel Association of Canada reported that 21 per cent of Canadian leisure travellers had travelled by car to a U.S. airport in 2010, and an additional 11 per cent were looking at that option for 2011. In 2009, 18 per cent of Canadian air travellers drove south to get cheaper flights. So there's clearly a shift taking place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're seeing bleeding to places like Syracuse,” Paul Benoit, president and CEO of the Ottawa International Airport Authority said at a news conference last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. airports, where travellers face a ‘passenger facilities charge' of only $4.50 per person, are hungry for Canadian business. In a recent press release, Alaska Airlines offered a promotional $149 flight to Hawaii, out of Bellingham, describing the airport just south of the Canadian border as an “alternative airport for travelers in north western Washington and southern British Columbia.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bellingham is just 90 minutes from YVR on Highway 99.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Berg has got to hope Canadian travellers soon forget the fee-hike headlines of last week, and focus instead on the amenities at YVR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a heck of a nice airport. Too bad about the $20 sting – and the cheaper tickets at the alternative just down the road.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How appropriate, then, that <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> – main sponsor of the 2012 NHL all-star game – would launch its brand-new mega-ultra-super large 24-ounce cup of coffee in time for the opening faceoff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A double-double-double, please: That means two of them just to get you through a single period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only the foolish, or the hopelessly naive, expect that the annual all-star game should be an actual game. There hasn't been a stiff check thrown in all-star competition since the 1700s. Only goalies bother showering once the buzzer goes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But so what? It's not a game but a party, and as the 2012 version closed out Sunday afternoon in Ottawa, the only possible complaint could be that the miserable weather last Friday made skating on the Rideau Canal impossible – but only for a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the actual game, it has long been accepted that the scores will more resemble an NFL game than an NHL game, and this time was no different as Team Chara defeated the hometown favourite Team Alfredsson 12-9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took a surprising 4 minutes 34 seconds before the first one was scored, however, and that by Marian Gaborik – the eventual most valuable player – on a pretty passing play with Pavel Datsyuk. After Gaborik scored on his New York Rangers teammate Henrik Lundqvist he spun to his knee at the blueline, using his hockey stick as a gun on Lundqvist, who had previously suggested he knew Gaborik's moves so well from practices that he wasn't concerned about stopping the sharpshooter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gaborik later said he had decided before the game to do it, but only if he scored on his friend and teammate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He's one of the best, if not the best, goalie in the league,” Gaborik said of Lundqvist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Team Chara – named after Boston Bruins captain Zdeno Chara – went up 2-0 when NHL scoring leader Evgeni Malkin of the Pittsburgh Penguins flipped the puck like a sand wedge shot up over Lundqvist's glove hand. Gaborik then made it 3-0 when he tapped in a nice cross-crease pass from Chicago Blackhawks winger Marian Hossa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Team Alfredsson – named after the Ottawa Senators' long-time captain Daniel Alfredsson – managed to put a small spoonful of drama back into the first period by coming back with three goals of their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That period also featured only the second-ever penalty shot in an all-star game when one was awarded – rather generously – to Tampa Bay Lightning sniper Steven Stamkos. The NHL's leading goal scorer with 32 and the skills shootout champion only the night before, Stamkos could not score to put Team Alfredsson into the lead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Team Chara goaltender Carey Price said he felt “like a lamb being led to the slaughter” as the Montreal Canadien dressed for the second. He wasn't far off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Team Alfredsson coach John Tortorella tweaked his lineup slightly and moved Alfredsson onto the same line as the Sedin twins, Henrik and Daniel. It worked wonders. After Team Chara went ahead 5-3 on goals by Gaborik – his third of the game – and Joffrey Lupul of the Toronto Maple Leafs, the Swedish Line went to work. Following a goal by Buffalo Sabres forward Jason Pominville, Alfredsson tied the game at five when he split the Team Chara defence – a term used loosely – and scored on Price. Moments later, he scored again on a pretty three-way passing play to give his team the lead, only to have Team Chara tie matters once again at 6-6 through Patrick Kane of the Blackhawks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third period belonged to Team Chara, with Phil Kessel of the Leafs putting them in front. Another Senator, Milan Michalek, scored for the Alfredsson side, then Calgary Flames captain Jarome Iginla scored for Team Chara. One last time Team Alfredsson tied the game on a goal by young Philadelphia Flyers star Claude Giroux.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chara's squad moved ahead to stay when Hossa scored on a screen, then Chara himself, then Corey Perry of the Anaheim Ducks scored.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Sedin scored on a lovely passing play between his brother Henrik and an impressed Alfredsson. “They have some language that's almost alien,” Alfredsson said of playing with the twins. “You just have to get the frequency – but nobody's figured it out.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, Alfredsson had figured it out well, barely missing his hat trick when he rang a hard shot off the post in the third period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Alfredsson, who received a thunderous standing ovation following his first goal, it was like “a whole ego weekend,” with the capital city in a party mood and the Senators doing far better than anyone, players included, believed possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He did not win the car – that went to Gaborik – and his team did not win, but he didn't need to win anything he doesn't already own.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It takes an American to argue persuasively that it is in Canada's national interest to strengthen its ties with Mexico, a relationship that academic Robert Pastor says has been “consciously or unconsciously undermined” by successive Canadian governments. A good place to start would be for Ottawa to lift its visa restrictions on Mexicans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Implemented in 2009, the visa was intended to stop spurious refugee claims by Mexicans. But Canada has toughened its refugee laws, and persisting with the visa requirement is widely seen in Mexico for what it is, an insult to a key hemispheric ally.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By viewing Mexico as a partner, and less as a rival for Washington's attention, Canada could benefit. Mexico is on track to replace Italy as the world's 10th-largest economy within four years, and is expected to grow at an annual rate of 4 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Pastor, an academic at American University in Washington and author of The North American Idea, said Canada's belief that it already has a “special relationship” with Washington is misguided. Twenty-two countries, including Israel, Germany and most countries in Central America and the Caribbean, claim the same thing. He said Mexico, in fact, gets more attention in Washington than Canada receives, because of the vast number of Mexican immigrants in the U.S., most of them legal, and because drug violence has U.S. attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think Canadians believe strongly in the idea of a special relationship with the U.S. that would translate into good policies. The absence of those policies hasn't been able to convince Canadians the strategy isn't working,” he said in a visit to The Globe editorial board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, a strategic alliance with Mexico could give Canada better access, said Dr. Pastor, who was visiting as a guest of the Canadian International Council. In addition, he said, “Washington is not happy about having to duplicate action plans with Mexico and Canada.” As an example, last month's border agreement between Canada and the U.S. was replicated by an agreement between Mexico and the U.S that, in some ways, is more advanced, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada should push to resume the trilateral meetings between leaders, twice delayed, and also work to strengthen bilateral ties with Mexico, beginning with lifting the visa requirement.</p>

He knocked the rust off his 40-minute workout routine, but it took too much time away from his family. Encouraged by a chat with an NHL star athlete, the 43-year-old from Toronto started a new regimen of shorter, more intense workouts before shooting Mr. D, his new TV show on CBC, in which he plays an underqualified teacher.

I do push-ups on the Bosu on an incline, I do front lat pull-downs, some curls, planks in 10-second intervals of six because I was told the 60-second plank is no longer good, but I break for three seconds after every 10.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Get nutrients from foods</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All supplements Gerry is taking can be replaced by a diet of whole grains, lean proteins, healthy fats, fruits and vegetables,” says Mr. Benvie. “Gerry needs to eat breakfast consistently – the shake and oatmeal are perfect, but add ice water – and curb the late-night snacks or stick to something low-carb like a handful of almonds. Eat a lower carb supper. Try a stir-fry with a lean meat and lots of vegetables.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Switch to multi-muscle moves</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For the workouts, compound movements that involve multiple muscle groups maximize time and efficiency. Do upper body pushes [push-ups, bench press], upper body pulls [pull-ups, rows], lower body pushes [squats, lunges], lower body pulls [deadlifts], and core. Run on an incline of eight for one minute, then an incline of one for one minute as recovery, and repeat 10 times. As Gerry gets fitter, he can increase the speed or incline to make it challenging.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time, in other words, to ante up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For an organization that has done a poor job of managing its message this baseball off-season – and make no mistake, in the Twitter world that is an absolute necessity – Monday's function was a masterpiece of subtlety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were the usual questions about ticket prices, merchandise and replays on the videoboard and, while there was some criticism of the Blue Jays' quiet off-season and aforementioned failure to manage their message, it was master of ceremonies Buck Martinez who dragged out the 300-pound elephant in the room by asking Beeston and general manager Alex Anthopoulos about first baseman Prince Fielder, who signed a nine-year, $214-million (U.S.) free-agent contract with the Detroit Tigers without getting a sniff from the Jays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That gave Beeston a chance to hammer home the point that he is philosophically opposed to long-term contracts of more than five years. Anthopoulos would later say “nothing is carved in stone” and Beeston had “evolved” with the game to the point where he had moved beyond his stance that a contract should not be longer than three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Beeston crafted his answer carefully, noting that to offer contracts of six or seven years to free agents this winter would have meant going against principles the team had put in place in previous negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such as the five-year, $65-million deal outfielder Jose Bautista signed last spring, for example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A cynic would of course note it's a convenient excuse for not spending in the free-agent market or running interference for ownership – arguing about a person's philosophy for running a team is like arguing with a manager about a decision based on a gut feeling – but it's a better and much-clearer explanation than had been given previously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was almost as if the Blue Jays didn't know what to do with the good will and sense of fan excitement they found themselves with at the end of the 2011 season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They squandered some of that currency and Monday was an attempt to build it back up, with Anthopoulos getting in the act and stating clearly that a particular trade he didn't make – let's take a wild stab here, folks, and say it was for Seattle Mariners pitcher Michael Pineda – fell apart because the other team wanted a major-league-ready player.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Several sources say that player was third baseman Brett Lawrie; the Blue Jays balked and instead the Mariners did some good business with the New York Yankees, landing catcher Jesus Montero.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the most intriguing suggestions put forth by Beeston – in response to a fan question – was that there had been discussion into the logistics of putting down a permanent natural grass field at the Rogers Centre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technology exists, to the point where Beeston said it was not just a theoretical discussion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would necessitate the Rogers Centre being configured as a full-time baseball stadium, Beeston said, which would not be good news for another building tenant, the Toronto Argonauts. The Argos' lease expires after the 2012 CFL season.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NHL goes back to work Tuesday night on 13 fronts, the players renewed and revitalized by a week off in the middle of the dog days of winter, and ready to gear up for that frantic, final push for playoff spots.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As usual in the NHL, where parity rules, just a handful of teams are so far gone that they are already thinking next-season thoughts. And even those with just the slightest mathematical hint of a hope can point to the 2009 NHL all-star break, when the 15th-place team in the Western Conference standings that year, the St. Louis Blues, climbed all the way to sixth spot by season's end and qualified for the playoffs with a fabulous final push.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Blues made up nine points in the final 10 weeks, and that rally will hearten Randy Cunneyworth's Montreal Canadiens, who find themselves 11th in the Eastern Conference standings, eight points back of a playoff spot, and needing the same sort of alchemy that St. Louis manufactured three years ago to play themselves into contention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or think about last season, when the Buffalo Sabres were sitting 10th at the all-star break, six points behind the eighth-place Atlanta Thrashers. Ultimately, Buffalo surged, Atlanta faded and the Sabres gained a whopping 22 points on the Thrashers in the final 10 weeks of the season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's good news for the former Thrashers, now residing in Winnipeg and known as the Jets, who are ninth in the East and just five points back of the three teams tied for the final two playoff spots in the conference – the Florida Panthers, New Jersey Devils and Toronto Maple Leafs, all settled in at 55 points. If Buffalo could do it last year, Winnipeg can manage it this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That 55-point total is also the magic playoff number in the Western Conference, where the eminently vulnerable Minnesota Wild (3-6-1 in their past 10 games, but coming off two consecutive wins) are trying to hold off the Colorado Avalanche, Dallas Stars, Calgary Flames and Phoenix Coyotes, all of whom are within striking distance, three or fewer points back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the West was similarly tight at the all-star break, with just two points separating six teams (Chicago Blackhawks, Colorado, San Jose Sharks, Minnesota, Los Angeles Kings and Calgary). San Jose was technically ninth at the break, Los Angeles 11th, and both teams made it, knocking out Dallas and Colorado, respectively. Dallas had an especially hard fade. With Brad Richards out for a great deal of time because of a concussion, San Jose put up 19 more points than the Stars did down the stretch, and Los Angeles gained 13. Dallas was eliminated on the final day of the season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a tight race down to the wire, and Richards' injury last year is instructive to any team hoping to qualify because player health is the one factor beyond any team's control. If you lose a key cog to injury, he cannot be replaced, no matter how much trade chatter you might hear between now and the NHL trading deadline, 27 days from now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(One of the teams likely to be selling this year, the Carolina Hurricanes, took their No. 1 trading property off the market Monday by signing defenceman Tim Gleason to a four-year, $16-million (U.S.) contract extension. Carolina could still make pending unrestricted free agents Tuomo Ruutu and Bryan Allen available to the highest bidder – and the price for rentals could go sky high this season, with only the Columbus Blue Jackets and the Edmonton Oilers completely and irrevocably out of playoff contention.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The math never changes – 16 teams qualify for postseason play, 14 miss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But hope is a seductive quality and history contributes to it. Every year, somebody seems to catch lightning in a bottle and comes from off the pace in a mad rush to the finish line – and then, who knows what can happen? In 2009, the Anaheim Ducks just scraped it as the No. 8 seed and carried that momentum into the first round, where they knocked off top-seeded San Jose, a 117-point team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coyotes coach Dave Tippett calls the teams clustered around the cutoff line in the West “a pack” and says the goal now is “to get yourself at the top of that pack. And it seems like the pack expands every year by a team or two. So that's where we're at – and we know the challenge ahead of us.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So does everybody else in the West. A little luck, a little good health, somebody having an off year that catches fire at the right time … it all adds to the intrigue and the drama as the NHL heads for home, with so much still to decide.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitt Romney's campaign strategists are not the only ones likening Newt Gingrich to the horror movie antagonist who keeps coming back from the dead. The ex-Speaker has taken up the metaphor himself. But unlike his rival's operatives, he is not joking about it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With polls showing Mr. Romney heading toward a decisive win in Tuesday's Republican primary in Florida, Mr. Gingrich is vowing to take his fight against the pro-Romney party establishment all the way to the GOP convention in August – and win it in the end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In almost any other election year, such musings would be quickly dismissed as an idle threat. But with the introduction of new primary rules divvying up delegates from most states on a proportional basis, and the possibility of unlimited spending by outside groups supporting Mr. Gingrich, the scrappy former Speaker of the House of Representatives may not be talking through his hat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In June and July, it was explained to us by the establishment that we were dead,” Mr. Gingrich told supporters at a Monday rally at a Tampa airplane hangar. “We then came back and by December … we were 12 points ahead nationally.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a barrage of negative ads paid for by groups supporting Mr. Romney sapped Mr. Gingrich's momentum – leading to fourth-place finishes in this month's votes in Iowa and New Hampshire – “we then came back from that and beat him in South Carolina.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gingrich insisted that, while Mr. Romney might win more state primaries than him, the aversion to the former Massachusetts governor among the grassroots means he cannot amass the magic number of 1,144 delegates before the convention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That message may not enable Mr. Gingrich to win Florida. But it could resonate with supporters elsewhere and help him in future primaries. Gallup's daily tracking poll on Monday showed the two front-runners tied among GOP voters nationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate Gallup poll out Monday showed that Mr. Gingrich would lose to Barack Obama by 12 percentage points if he were to face the President in the November general election. The survey showed Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama tied with 48-per-cent support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Gingrich rejected the suggestion that Mr. Romney is more electable than him, arguing that the lack of a clear contrast between Mr. Obama and the “Massachusetts moderate” would doom the party's chances of retaking the White House this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We nominated a moderate in 1996 and he lost. We nominated a moderate in 2008 and he lost,” Mr. Gingrich said at the Monday rally, referring to Bob Dole and John McCain, respectively. “Mitt Romney's more liberal than either of those candidates.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign perhaps of his waning momentum in Florida, Mr. Gingrich drew only a few hundred supporters to the rally at the Tampa Jet Center, a precipitous drop from the thousands who turned out at his first events here after his Jan. 21 win in South Carolina.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those who did wait up to three hours for a glimpse of their habitually late candidate – introduced by his former rival and Tea Party hero Herman Cain, who endorsed Mr. Gingrich on Saturday – seemed thrilled at the prospect of a protracted nomination battle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's high time we had a fight to the finish,” insisted Carol Crumpler, 68, a Tampa area real estate agent. “It's really important that we don't chicken out and turn tail and run.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Constrained by limits on donations by individuals to candidates, Mr. Gingrich has struggled to raise money to fund his own campaign machine. In earlier election cycles, that alone would likely have forced him to drop out of the race by now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But outside groups known as Super PACs, freed by recent court rulings to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money on a candidate's behalf, have kept Mr. Gingrich's candidacy alive. If they continue to do so, he could stick it out until the convention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more that Republican establishment figures such as Mr. Dole and Mr. McCain warn of the disaster awaiting the party if it nominates Mr. Gingrich, the more they feed into his own campaign narrative as the insurgent who would actually rock the boat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The threat of a schism in the party is perhaps greater than at any time since 1992, as members of the old guard (from which Mr. Gingrich, a three-decade Washington veteran, has dissociated himself) are challenged by the new populists seeking to replace them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the new guard is Mr. McCain's 2008 running mate, Sarah Palin, who urged the grassroots to rebel against the party and media elites seeking to “crucify” Mr. Gingrich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If for no other reason [than] to rage against the machine, vote for Newt,” she told Fox News on Saturday. “Annoy a liberal. Vote Newt.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And keep on feeding establishment nightmares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PIPELINE PROMISE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich spoke directly to Canadians at a campaign stop in Tampa Monday, vowing to kick-start the Keystone XL pipeline on his first day in the Oval Office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I want to promise Canadians on the very first day I will sign an executive order authorizing construction [of Keystone] as of that day,” Mr. Gingrich said at a rally in Florida. “Canadians will know on election night they do not have to build a pipeline across the Rockies,” he added, referring to a proposal to build a pipeline to Kitimat, B.C., that would open up Canadian oil sales to Asia.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people deeply dislike the way the word “honour” kept being dragged in to describe the terrible Shafia murders (even though Mohammad Shafia himself could not shut up about it). These crimes weren't “honourable” at all. Besides, why single them out as something special and culturally specific? Men murder women every day. This was just another form of domestic violence, which exists in every culture. “It's unfortunately something that could be anywhere,” Saleha Khan, a board member with a Muslim social-services group, told the Toronto Star.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, no, it couldn't. Yet many people still say it's wrong to draw links between cultural values and violence against women. Adeena Niazi, executive director of the Afghan Women's Organization in Toronto, told CBC Radio that Afghan culture has nothing to do with this case, and it's unfortunate that some argue otherwise. “It has nothing to do with culture – none of the culture approve violence and killing,” she explained. Instead, the proper way to judge the murderers – Mohammad, his wife Tooba Yahya and their oldest son, Hamed – is as individuals acting on their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But of course it's impossible to understand this crime without the culture. And it's important to understand honour crimes for exactly what they are. They are not ordinary domestic violence carried out in a fit of rage. Instead, they are carefully premeditated acts designed to remove the stain of a wife or daughter's sexual misconduct (real or imagined) from the family name. They are often approved or tolerated by the community. Wives often condone or even help commit them. And the perpetrators are invariably convinced of their rightness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We usually associate honour crimes with the poor and unsophisticated. Mohammad Shafia was rich and worldly, which is partly why this case is so shocking. His obsession with his daughters' sexuality strikes us as pathological. But it's not unusual in Afghanistan and large parts of the Middle East. In Iraq, after the U.S. invasion, a common form of revenge was to have your enemy's teenaged daughter abducted and perhaps raped. That would guarantee the ruin of the entire family, which would sometimes kill her for disgracing them. Many girls and their mothers assured me that while this was unbearably cruel and unfair, it was necessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These attitudes have been moderated but not entirely extinguished by contact with Canadian life. They are a problem in some South Asian communities, too. In Britain, police dealt with an estimated 3,000 honour-related crimes in 2010, including threats, abduction, acid attacks, beatings, forced marriage and mutilation, as well as the occasional murder. In Canada, such horrors are mercifully rare. But many of our schools and social-service agencies tread gingerly when faced with the challenges of cultures that treat boys and girls in such strikingly different ways. Schools and social workers are caught between conflicting demands to accommodate multiculturalism and also to safeguard the best interests of children. It's not surprising that they sometimes fail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For girls like these three sisters, finding the safe place between the mosque and the mall isn't always easy. Talking more plainly about culture – what attitudes are acceptable and what are not, and what values must absolutely be respected – will help all of us to help girls like them. If their tragedy makes it any easier, then some small good will have come of it.</p>

But now, under the Fifth Republic, Bismarck's present successor as German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has undertaken to make joint campaign appearances with Nicolas Sarkozy in the presidential election in April. This cross-border endorsement may portend a new era of transnational politics in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy are temperamentally quite different, and until recently there was said to be antipathy between them. They have evidently learned to get along, thanks to their frequent meetings over the euro zone crisis. A hybrid personality called Merkozy has been invented: the zone's imaginary leader.</p>

On the news of the joint campaign events, Mr. Hollande's spokesperson said that Mr. Sarkozy should not engage in a “hostage-taking” of Franco-German relations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the long series of wars between France and Germany ended, Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer were friendly, and Helmut Schmidt and Valéry Giscard d'Estaing still more so, in the 1970s. But any German leader who had tried to tell French citizens whom to vote for (or the converse) would have evoked bitter memories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Merkel's intervention in the French election has aroused some indignation, but not widespread outrage. It is a political manoeuvre, rather than a proposal for political unity in Europe, but the nation-states of the continent may find that it is a slippery precedent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In theory, the mayor of Toronto has plenty of power. He is elected citywide and he is elected directly by the voters. That should give him a broad mandate to implement his program.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In practice, he is only one voice among 45 on city council. In the words of Denise Bellamy, the judge who wrote a 2005 report into the Toronto computer-leasing scandal, “Council is the source/primary locus of almost all authority with relatively few exceptions, including all legislative authority.” By contrast, “The statutory authority of the mayor … is actually quite limited.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Rob Ford is now confronting this reality. He is mayor of all the city, but he is not all powerful. In a municipal system with no political parties, he can't simply command his ruling party to vote his program into law. To get his way, he has to go back into the arena again and again, and win each time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means employing all his powers of persuasion. A mayor is not the city's commander; he is its Persuader in Chief. Yet so far Mr. Ford has displayed few of these powers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider the pickle he is in over transit. On his first day in office, Dec. 1, 2010, he killed the Transit City plan, ending a multibillion-dollar project, years in the making, that had been negotiated and funded and was even at the preliminary stages of construction. He never took that decision to city council. Four months later, he struck a deal with the provincial government to start a whole new transit project, again without council's approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is now coming back to bite him. Councillors are challenging his authority and threatening to hold a vote in March overturning the new deal with Queen's Park. They even have a legal opinion, which draws on Judge Bellamy's report, that purports to show how far he strayed beyond his authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They make a convincing case. Toronto's failure to expand its rapid-transit system is one of the biggest issues facing the city. Determining how best to use the $8-billion dedicated by Queen's Park for transit expansion is arguably the most important decision in the four years of Mr. Ford's mayoral term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course council must have a say. The memorandum of understanding between city and province makes it clear that any final deal to proceed with a new transit plan is “subject to the approval of their respective governing bodies.” If councillors don't get to vote on this issue, which will affect the transportation future of the city for decades to come, then what is the purpose of city council?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ford could get out of this fix in two ways. One, he could accept the sensible proposal put forward by TTC chair Karen Stintz to modify the current transit plan and bring part of the proposed all-underground Eglinton-Scarborough Crosstown line onto the surface, saving something like $1.5-billion or $2-billion and putting some of the money toward his favourite project, a Sheppard subway extension. Two, he could try to make a convincing argument that keeping it all underground is worth the enormous cost because it would result in a superior transit solution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, he simply says, “I did what the taxpayers want. They want subways.” Or, “I was in Scarborough over the weekend. People came up to me and said they want subways. That's it.” Or, “It's all subways. It's all about subways.” That was the extent of the argument he put forward when he met the media on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course people prefer subways. The question is whether it makes sense to use all of the money offered by the province on a buried light-rail line that goes underground where it doesn't need to. To paraphrase Desi Arnaz, Mr. Ford has some persuading to do.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Deb Matthews, it must have been a welcome reprieve.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through an entire luncheon speech to the Toronto Board of Trade, and most of a subsequent news conference, Ontario's Health Minister got to talk about changes she wants to make to the provincial system – not the mess she's spent the past couple of months trying to clean up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even as she unveiled her “action plan,” the spectre of Ornge hung over her. Because as Dalton McGuinty's Liberals try to do what's needed to make health care sustainable, they will have to get past the stigma created by their previous mistakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite Ms. Matthews' characteristically reassuring tone, most of the reforms she proposed on Tuesday – including bringing family doctors under the purview of Local Health Integration Networks, shifting high-volume procedures from hospitals to specialized clinics and moving toward more “evidence-based” medicine – require a willingness to experiment. That in turn means the government has to be trusted, and trust itself, to take risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A saga like the one at the province's air-ambulance service does not help. A public-private model aimed at simultaneously improving service and containing costs, Ornge began as an example of creative thinking. Today, with auditors and provincial investigators swarming, its operations curtailed and its leadership ousted amid reports of questionable business practices, it looks more like a cautionary tale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To some extent, the lessons drawn from Ornge should help avoid similar messes in future. It will be a long time, and rightly so, before an Ontario government allows an agency to function with such blurry lines between for-profit and not-for-profit operations, or with as much power in the hands of one entrepreneur as president and CEO Chris Mazza seemed to have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the nature of experiments is that not every one will work out. So unless the government puts in place such oppressive safeguards that everyone involved is afraid of his or her own shadow, it has to accept that reforms will generate some bad-news stories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the government moves forward with funding more surgeries in not-for-profit clinics, rather than hospitals, not every one will perform as well as the Kensington Eye Institute – the cataract-surgery provider that Ms. Matthews held up as the gold standard. And even if the vast majority perform to expectations, the minority that underperform will probably get more attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same goes for the province's 14 LHINs. Most of them may eventually live up to their promise of decentralizing decision-making, while providing cost-saving co-ordination between local providers. But some will use their power better than others, and enterprising journalists or opposition members could well find a place where it's being abused.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evidence-based medicine, basically code for rationing care more effectively, has the potential to be even more politically damaging. By ensuring that money is spent on the treatments that are most needed and most effective, the government could save a lot of lives, net. But not funding certain surgeries or tests or prescriptions would likely lead to allegations of individual lives lost because of government decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, each policy change presents enough alarming scenarios to push any government toward a state of paralysis. And a government in its ninth year, having accumulated baggage along the way, is all the more susceptible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Matthews, despite mixed accounts of just how bold she is behind the scenes, seemed to recognize on Tuesday that the status quo is in fact the most dangerous risk of all. “If we do not make these changes,” she said, then “one of the best things about being a Canadian, universal health care,” will not survive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less than a minute after the minister had finished her news conference, NDP MPP Cindy Forster stepped in front of the microphones to tell reporters that Ornge and eHealth proved that the Liberals can't be trusted. It was the obvious thing for an opposition party to say, and Ontarians will have to take it into account the next time they go to the polls. But in the meanwhile, they should hope the Liberals don't believe it themselves.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is not a complete answer for preventing similar, preventable murders within families. Child-protection authorities failed utterly to protect Zainab, Sahar and Geeti Shafia, ages 19, 17 and 13, and a public inquest or other form of inquiry is necessary to understand why that deadly failure occurred after the three sisters raised alarms with a teacher, child-protection workers and police.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first-degree murder verdicts bring a mandatory penalty of life, with no parole eligibility for 25 years. Some may find that inadequate in expressing society's revulsion and horror at a father, mother and brother, all Afghan-Canadians, who killed to protect the family name. Some may feel that broad statements of community values (“no stoning of women”) need to be thrust, in the style of Hérouxville, Que., at new immigrants. Others may propose that newcomers be made to watch videos about national values, as they are in the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best weapon Canada has against the medievalism of honour killings is that justice is certain, swift and severe, though still respecting of life's sacredness. No educational video will stop people like Mohammed Shafia, his wife Tooba Yahya and their eldest son, Hamed, from killing because of a twisted mix of cultural, religious and personal reasons. Social workers from school boards or children's aid may try to help immigrant parents deal with cultural clashes with their children, but not everyone will accept that help. The rule of law speaks loudest and sends the clearest message.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Honour killings need to be denounced head-on because they are rooted in a community's support for premeditated murder of women and girls who violate cultural or religious norms. Family violence and murder can be found in all ethnic groups, but honour killings are a direct challenge to the notion that laws should protect women. Thankfully, they are rare in Canada. But any Afghan-Canadian or other community in which honour killings are found needs to confront the attitudes that lead to the murder of children and women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rule of law is the antithesis of the medievalism that – we can have no illusions about this – exists to some extent in this country. Murder is never a private matter within families. Zainab, Sahar and Geeti were under the protection of all Canadians – and that protection failed. Canadians have a right to know why the authorities did not do a better job, and whether they will be up to the challenge the next time.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are few things more heartbreaking than a child with no friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But being friendless is the norm for Canadian children with physical and developmental disabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new study, written by Anne Snowdon, who is a nurse and professor at the Odette School of Business at the University of Windsor in Ontario, shows that 53 per cent of disabled kids have no friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even those with friends have very limited interactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside of formal settings such as the classroom, less than two hours a week spent with their peers is the norm; only 1 per cent of children with disabilities spend an hour a day with friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is most serious for boys – who tend to have far more developmental disabilities and fewer social skills – and it gets worse with age. In childhood, efforts are made, but by the time kids hit age 10 or so, when cliques and social circles form outside of parental control, ostracization and isolation is near complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada, we talk a good game about integration, about breaking down barriers to allow the inclusion of people with physical and social disabilities in every aspect of daily life. But reality is more stark and harsh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real integration requires a lot more than building ramps, adopting human rights legislation and funding programs. Grudging accommodation, with a dash of tokenism, is not enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we want people to be healthy – physically, mentally, emotionally – and to reach their full potential, they need to be full citizens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kids with disabilities can't be segregated and shut out of mainstream society. They need to be like every kid, in school, in swim class, on the bus, in the playground and hanging out at the mall with friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the underlying theme of the new report, Strengthening Communities for Canadian Children with Disabilities, which Dr. Snowdon presented last week at the annual conference of the Sandbox Project. (Sandbox, founded in 2009 by pediatric surgeon and now MP Kellie Leitch, is designed to spur improvements in the health outcomes of Canadian children in areas such as injury prevention, obesity, mental health, and the environment.) “Children and youth with disabilities and their families need and want to connect and engage with their communities in a meaningful, accessible and accommodating way that enables social interaction and development,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To conduct the research, Dr. Snowdon and her team did in-depth interviews with 166 families in Regina, Fredericton and Toronto, along with some focus groups. All the families had children with physical and developmental disabilities (ranging from Down syndrome to autism). Children with psychiatric disabilities such as bipolar disorder were not included, but one can imagine the issues would be similar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Above all, the report focuses on the practical. What are the challenges caregivers face and what help is available to them?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interestingly, the most common complaint was not lack of services but poor communication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Finding information on what is available is a big challenge,” said Sally Jordan, a caregiver to her 22-year-old nephew with severe developmental disabilities. In this, the communications age, she relies on word-of-mouth and tips from other parents to find out what services are available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As far as anyone can tell, there are a plethora of programs for kids with disabilities. But a startling 78 per cent of parents said their children don't participate regularly in community programs. There are a variety of reasons. Many programs are inaccessible (that doesn't mean there are no ramps, it means they are at inconvenient times or in inconvenient places). Transportation is a major problem for children who, because of their disabilities, can't use public transit. And cost is a big factor, especially as parents of children with life-long disabilities often stop paid work to become caregivers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the report, Dr. Snowdon makes three main recommendation:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Create a single online reference tool that lists all community programs, services and professional care available to people with disabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Invest in programs where disabled kids are integrated, not segregated, so they can feel part of their community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Find ways to expand the social networks of children and teenagers to break the isolation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and other social networking tools have been a godsend for disabled kids because they removes barriers – like being judged for the way you look. But being a “virtual” citizen is only a baby step in the right direction, it's not enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Snowdon said she was surprised to learn from parents and children themselves that isolation was far more painful to live with than physical or development disabilities themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's an issue, she said, that really tugs at the heartstrings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But beyond the emotional response, there are practical consequences. Social interaction is key to quality of life: It's how we find love, how we find work and how we have fun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having a disability does not obviate those needs; if anything, it magnifies them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes weneed to stop and reflect on the value of friendship, of a sense of belonging, and the value of community itself to our individual and collective health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relationships matter more than fancy programs, but where programs do exist, they should be known and accessible and, above all, foster interaction.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years now, the University of B.C. has been one of the toughest postsecondary institutions in the country in which to gain admittance.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, student hopefuls have had to have grade point averages in the low 90s for science and engineering and the mid-to-high 80s for everything else. For the most part, the school has treated its high academic threshold as a badge of honour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a strict meritocratic entry system can have its drawbacks, as the school has discovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As undergraduate admission standards have shot ever further skyward, the student body has been something of an intellectual – and some would say cultural – monolith.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, the students are unquestionably bright, but many are nerdy, high achievers consumed with one thing: marks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consequently, the student body has become increasingly uni-dimensional, dominated by brainiacs void of any curiosity about all that university life can be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So starting next fall, UBC will convert to a broad-based admissions system, one in which marks will still be important but a prospective undergrad's back story will be considered as well. The school is hoping it will end up attracting more well-rounded applicants, ones whose marks may not be off the charts but who possess other attributes that portend important qualities such as leadership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UBC will be the first major university in Canada to incorporate non-academic criteria fully into its application process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We've known for years that high-school GPAs are a powerful predictor and will continue to be,” explains James Ridge, UBC's associate vice-president and registrar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But I think the overall concern is that we were looking at such a narrow aspect of who that student is, how they performed in four or five courses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We were increasingly realizing we were missing elements of that student's experience and accomplishments. Even the challenges they face can be powerful predictors of the future roles they may fill.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides submitting their grades, students applying for 2012-13 admittance to UBC are filling out a five-question survey that, among other things, asks them to share personal experiences that have shaped their lives. (UBC refused to provide the questions to me.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A student who may have grades in the 70s but who has been helping a single mother raise two other siblings by working odd jobs might now be accepted to the school where they would not have in the past when only their GPA mattered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That kind of story puts their academic accomplishments in a hugely important context,” Mr. Ridge says. “It tells us about their commitment, time-management skills, perseverance, important information that we had no way of collecting, let alone evaluating, before.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says how much weight the school gives the questionnaires will likely vary by faculty. Science and engineering will likely still place more significance on marks – maybe 60-40. With the rest, it could balance out at about 50-50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UBC's Sauder School of Business has been using a broad-based admissions system since 2004, after receiving complaints from the business community that their graduates often lacked vital leadership and interpersonal skills. Since they changed their admissions policy, those complaints have dropped off dramatically. Meantime, it's helped attract students who want to get involved in extra-curricular activities, such as student government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing the university insists is not afoot here is any attempt to change its cultural demographic. More than 40 per cent of the student body is of Asian descent, a fact that has created much discussion and unquestionably some resentment in the greater community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many believe Asian students are largely responsible for driving up the GPA admission bar at UBC. Their strong presence on campus has also helped perpetuate what many insist is a false stereotype – that Asian students (and their parents) are focused on success and grades to the exclusion of everything else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I couldn't say more forcefully that this is not what this change is about,” Mr. Ridge says. “It's inconceivable to me that a university would use its admissions instruments to gerrymander their demographics or the ethnicity of their student population.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he says the school will be watching to see whether the new policy has any “adverse demographic effects or unintended consequences” on the makeup of the undergrad population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We won't know for a few years what impact the new policy has had. Still, the move seems progressive and one that will lead to a much richer and diverse student body.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end that can only be as good thing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most people have a story of a friend of a friend who got sick or injured while travelling and ended up tens of thousands of dollars poorer as a result. Yet when asked if they want travel medical insurance, the gut reaction might be “no” for a variety of reasons. Since medical emergencies can have financially catastrophic results, it's normally an insurance worth buying.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some credit cards might offer it if purchased on those specific cards, but are all coverages created equal? “No,” says Tammy Ezer of InsuranceHotline.com, “it's unwise to assume you are covered, and very wise to read over the fine print as policies vary from card to card and from carrier to carrier.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, I pulled up the fine print on a card issued by one of the big five banks for their out-of-province travel medical insurance. I actually had to click on the zoom button five times before it was easily readable. With this card, you are not covered if you are over 65 and coverage only lasts for the first 15 days you are out of province, including the departure date. You can extend your coverage by calling a number, but how many people would know that? “Pre-existing symptoms may invalidate coverage entirely for medical emergencies in any way connected with those conditions,” says Ms. Ezer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trip cancellation insurance is less important. While missing a trip that has been paid for wouldn't be pleasant, you would survive financially. You know exactly what you would be out: the amount paid when booking the trip. With a medical emergency, your bill could potentially run into the $50,000-plus range. And that's a big “plus” range. Besides, coverage for trip cancellation insurance normally requires a death in the family – someone getting too sick to travel, but not sustaining anything life-threatening doesn't count. Again, details vary by policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What if you lose your camera or other valuables? Think your homeowner's policy might cover you? In many cases your coverage could be 10 to 25 per cent of the regular policy amount when personal goods are stolen when you are abroad. Now, since you don't bring everything in your house when you travel, that's not really anything to worry about. What does cause concern is that you have to prove what was lost or stolen. You'll potentially need a receipt for that camera.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I haven't touched all the areas that could catch one out. So where do you go for more information? Call your agent and talk it over. Some people would rather have their teeth pulled than talk to an insurance agent, but you might thank them if you end up having to actually have your teeth pulled when you're out of the country.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Ask about pre-existing conditions coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Is there a deductible? How much is it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Check for the “stability clause” to make sure you are still covered in the event of a change to your prescriptions or a recent hospital stay as some insurance companies will deny your claim in the event of these circumstances prior to a trip.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The man who ruined more than a few little hockey players' hopes on all-star weekend admits to making mistakes.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brendan Shanahan – known formally as NHL vice-president of hockey and business development, and head disciplinarian, and informally, for those unable to take deep breaths, as “Sheriff Shanny” – is the one who suspended Alexander Ovechkin three games for a shot to the head of the Pittsburgh Penguins defenceman Zbynek Michalek.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result was the Washington Capitals superstar – first in the heart and dreams of small children – acted childishly himself in response, claiming he didn't “deserve” to come to Ottawa for the NHL all-star festivities, but deserved instead a few days romping in the Florida sunshine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shanahan says Ovechkin was dealt with properly and fairly, and while some might argue he should have been given more punishment, just as some say less, it would be hard to find anyone in the hockey world who would say Ovechkin deserved no suspension at all and a right to romp in the freezing rain and snow pellets that distinguish the Rideau Canal from South Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think I respect it,” Shanahan says of Ovechkin's decision to disappoint his young fans. “That situation was unique. I don't think it's ever happened before. I think it's something that internally we need to address and come up with something in the future. … What is our policy on that?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commissioner Gary Bettman likes to say the franchise fiasco in Phoenix is “a work in progress,” but so, too, is NHL policy on what to do about head shots such as the one Ovechkin delivered, and concussions, such as the one that has kept Pittsburgh Penguins star Sidney Crosby, Ovechkin's rival with young fans, effectively out of the game for more than a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shanahan concedes he suffers from “some imperfection, yeah” in doing his difficult job. “But,” he says with a smile, “I wasn't perfect as a player, either.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was close, though: a power forward who scored 656 goals and 698 assists in 1,524 games, a member of the exclusive “Triple Gold” club with an Olympic gold medal, a world championship and a Stanley Cup. He also had on-the-job training for the role he now has: 2,489 penalty minutes, plus another 280 in playoff action and more than a few disciplinary discussions with head office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been times over the past four months of dealing in hockey discipline, he says in appropriate language, where “I'd like to have that breakaway back.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What I say to the players is ‘Look, we'd all like to have perfect seasons. Your coach would like to have a perfect season. Your GM would love to never make a mistake on a signing. And I would love to have a perfect season and I won't.' I won't have a perfect season, but I strive for that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are moments that he says have been “just not our best day at the office.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The odd suspension might appear “glaringly high or glaringly low” and any debate can lead to a great deal of discussion between Shanahan's office and team general managers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says when the debate is over whether a player should get two or three or four or five games, it is a healthy debate. A serious problem would be where one side is at zero and the other at 10.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he says it is all – the suspensions, the explanations, the video – having the desired effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He sees the game as suitably physical but hits are down in number.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We had like 45,000 hits and at the end of year, we're down to 40,000 now. I just hope that those 5,000 are what we want to get rid of.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also cites two specific examples of what he sees as progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, would be Matt Cooke, previously the NHL's poster boy for head shots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, Cooke, a forward with the Penguins, has been mild-mannered by comparison, picking up few penalties and becoming known more for his play than his suspensions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If he comes up on a hit that's 50-50,” Shanahan says, speaking of a check that is on the edge of being a dirty or clean, “he knows, [Pittsburgh GM] Ray Shero knows, [head coach] Dan Bylsma knows, he's not going to be taking that hit.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Shanahan, prior to the start of the season, Cooke came to New York to meet with him and discuss how he might clean up his on-ice act and still be a physical presence out there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has seriously tried to change, Shanahan says, while certain other repeat offenders just don't seem to get it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shanahan's second example is Zac Rinaldo, a feisty and oft-penalized forward with the Philadelphia Flyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shanahan says Rinaldo has been told by his coaches and GM to think a little better about what he is doing. If he sees the chances of 20 hits during a game, “Take your best three – you'll still be that physical presence out there.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I hear coaching like that,” Shanahan says, “that's when I know there's full ‘buy' out there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But it's going to take time. Humbly I say that. We are doing our very best. I don't believe in just being completely unforgiving. We play. We know that things happen quickly, that emotions run high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don't believe we are in the business of punishing. Hopefully, we are in the business of changing.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Stephen Harper has renewed a perennial debate about when Canadians should expect to retire. Mr. Harper reportedly has in mind changes to the Old Age Security and the Guaranteed Income Supplement that would raise eligibility for such benefits from 65 to 67.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the reaction has focused on how such changes would affect public finances and the economy, essentially asking whether the benefits of reducing the cost of old-age income programs, plus the increased labour supply, justifies making older Canadians “worse off.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that approaches such changes exactly backward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such reforms, far from taking something away from seniors, are a tiny step in reversing decades of bad policy that has marginalized older Canadians, damaged their health and harmed their morale. Raising the age of eligibility is emphatically not a matter of imposing costs on seniors in order to benefit the rest of the population. It is an exceptionally pro-seniors policy to reduce the incentives to stop working at 65.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a time when 65 and retirement were closely linked for a compelling reason. A life of labour had left the average worker depleted. A few short years of decline was all they could expect before death. A Canadian male born in 1966, when the Canada Pension Plan was introduced, would only expect to live to age 68 or so. Today, it's 79.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Age 65 and the moment when one can no longer reasonably be expected to work have long since parted company. We live longer and are in better health. Much of the work in our increasingly service-based economy is not physically taxing. Many conditions associated with aging can be controlled by medication or corrected by surgery, with new breakthroughs daily. It is only a modest exaggeration when some say that 60 is the new 40.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Age 65 is no longer the exhausted tail end of life. And the research is eloquent about how central work is to the lives of those able to engage in it, including those over 65. For many, idyllic pictures of early and prolonged retirement without work are, in fact, not that attractive. Why? Because working is and has always been bound up with human fulfilment, with being productive, useful to others and responsible for oneself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why most people, not just a majority, but around 90 per cent of them, express great attachment to their work, independently of income, education, social class and whether they work for private companies, not-for-profits or the public sector. In both Canada and the United States, the vast majority of people tell pollsters they would continue working even if they no longer needed to, including if they won the lottery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than four-fifths of Canadians say they would like to continue to work even if they had enough money to retire. And nearly half of Canadians of working age already expect to work beyond the age of 65, and not just for economic reasons, according to a survey done for one financial institution: “Nearly all of those who expect to work beyond age 65 cite one or more lifestyle reasons, including remaining mentally active, enjoyment of their jobs and the interaction with their co-workers.” In other words, future retirees are coming more and more to realize that work (although not necessarily any particular job, a distinction many people seem to have difficulty grasping), is closely related to happiness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Put this together with the evidence that older people live longer, healthier and happier when they continue to work and you have a compelling case that our dogged insistence on 65 as the age to encourage retirement has been a cruel policy that has created increasing unhappiness and ill-health for older Canadians. Encouraging retirement at 65 has pushed these costs onto seniors for the benefit of our younger population looking for work. Benefit eligibility at 67 is, therefore, far too timid a reform. A pro-seniors policy would be far more ambitious, looking at 70 or even 72. Even then Canadians would enjoy a longer period of work-free retirement than in 1966.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada must, of course, continue to look after those incapable of working, whatever their age. Changes must be phased to allow for adjustment in retirement planning. Retirement must stop being a radical overnight transformation and become a long slow transition, from full time to part time, balancing work and leisure and matching effort to capacity. And we should use some of the savings from reform to improve retirement conditions for those who do reach the age and state of health where work is no longer possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, such changes will help public finances and ease the looming labour shortages that darken our economic future. But those are just side benefits. The chief beneficiaries will be older Canadians themselves.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your work focuses a lot on helping people in other countries develop their own source of income. But in rich countries like Canada, millions depend on welfare income and still live in poverty. How do we apply those overseas models here?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ANSWER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, we travelled in Africa with Sir Richard Branson, the billionaire founder of the <span class="companylink">Virgin Group</span> and avid philanthropist. We visited microcredit programs that provide small loans to people in poor communities to start businesses and become financially self-sufficient.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During that journey, he pondered aloud whether such a model could apply to the developed world and achieve scale through commercial banking. He told us that in November he bought a bank in England (the first time we've heard someone say those words) with the intention of creating a similar microloan program for British residents, modelled on the successes achieved overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Microcredit is a simple but powerful concept: Lend small amounts to people who wouldn't have the collateral for a regular bank loan to start a self-run business. Because the loans typically go to groups of people who vouch for and support each other, repayment rates are as high as 99 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pioneering microcredit institution was the <span class="companylink">Grameen Bank</span>, based in Bangladesh, and founded by economist and eventual Nobel Peace Laureate Muhammad Yunus in 1976. In 2008, the nonprofit Grameen America was launched in New York to provide microloans to Americans living below the poverty line to start their own small businesses. So far more than $32-million (U.S.) has been lent to 8,400 entrepreneurs, and five new branches have opened in three U.S. cities. Another nonprofit, ACCION USA, has lent more than $100-million to almost 20,000 individual low- and moderate-income entrepreneurs since 1991.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada, the first well-known microloan experiment was undertaken by Calmeadow, an Ontario-based global microfinance organization started by <span class="companylink">ACE Bakery</span> founders Martin Connell and Linda Haynes. The lessons learned in Calmeadow's Nova Scotia, Toronto and Vancouver experiences in the 1990s have informed further attempts, most successfully by a handful of Canada's credit unions, from Alterna to Vancity, who have stepped up to further develop the model with various products and tools for micro-entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe Canada needs something like Kiva.org – an online microcredit organization that allows “lenders” to support a business plan submitted by an overseas family, farmer or entrepreneur. Using this online platform, so far more than 650,000 individuals have lent a quarter-billion dollars to more than 700,000 entrepreneurs in 60 countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Microcredit isn't a cure-all, but its spirit of supporting entrepreneurship could be helpful for tackling some of the challenges of poverty in this country.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a lot to digest.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't mean the food, which was nice enough. It was the conversational menu that was unexpected – like eating food from a chef who figured he would serve up everything he had.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or in the case of my lunch companion, Terry Jones, the British ex-Monty-Python comedian, director and writer, what he had in his head. I wasn't sure what would be put on the table next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In town to promote the humorous health videos (Top Ten Tips for Health) he did with the late Toronto-based oncologist, Robert Buckman, for Lyceum Health, Mr. Jones was affable as he took his seat in a downtown restaurant. Dressed in a rumpled black suit, he spread his white dinner napkin over his knees and immediately engaged with a friendly smile on his pale, rubbery face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't until mid-lunch that he said something that helped explain everything that followed: “To me, it's like an adventure. You wake up in the morning and you think, ‘What's going to happen today?'” He was talking about his writing projects, which are considerable and varied. But he could just as easily have been describing his life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He spoke of the last time he saw Dr. Buckman, “a guru about the importance of humour with medicine,” whom he had met 30 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They had just spent a week shooting the health videos. “He was his usual self, full of jokes and enthusiasm,” Mr. Jones recalled. They worked for half of the last day filming, then had a pub lunch before Dr. Buckman left to catch his plane back to Toronto. “It was a bit of a shock, “ Mr. Jones said in his understated British manner about learning that Dr. Buckman had died in his sleep on the plane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was the bit about growing up in a Welsh family that was “really very poor … In primary school, I was writing about Christmas presents and saying that I was going to buy some new underwear for my father because his was all in tatters.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had the air of an absent-minded professor whose head is a jumble of people and places and ideas. Revelations dropped onto the table, almost accidentally, like notes from an over-stuffed pocket. Which is how the subject of his infidelity came up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I had asked where he lives in London. “I live in Highgate,” he replied with a brief description of his North London neighbourhood, where other ex-Pythons, Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin, are frequent pub companions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Ten years ago, I split with my wife. We had been together 38 years. It was terrible,” Mr. Jones added without prompting, shaking his head. He had fallen in love with a student at Oxford named Anna Soderstrom, he explained. “She's Swedish, and she was doing French and linguistics. I was doing a talk on Chaucer and selling books,” he said. “And she couldn't afford a book. I felt sorry for her so I gave her one. It's the only time I've ever done it. I don't know why I did it really.” He looked across at me, bemused and bewildered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is now 29. He is almost 70. “We have a little two-year-old girl,” he went on. Does he like being a father again? He has two adult children from his first marriage, both in their 30s. “Yeah, um, it's lovely,” he answered. “I just can't imagine the world without Siri.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has a grandchild, who is one year older than his latest child. “My two-year-old is auntie to a one-year-old,” he offered, laughing lightly at the strangeness of the situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next course was Chaucerian. Mr. Jones has been interested in the Middle Ages since he was a child. But in addition to Monty Python treatments in The Holy Grail and Life of Brian, Mr. Jones has written serious academic books on medieval life. His best known, Chaucer's Knight, offers an alternative view of the Chaucer character – not as a paragon of Christian virtue but as a typical mercenary who was potentially a cold-blooded murderer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I thought I would do something for the learned journals,” he explained. “It turned into a book and is still used in university. It's required reading,” he said in his manner of mild astonishment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I like my stories once removed. I like fantasy. And history is fantasy in a way. You have to reimagine what was going on,” he said at the end of a long and fact-filled tangent about Richard II, castle design, the Crusades and the mysteries of the famous Ellesmere manuscript of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next we were on to the story of a doctor who was a dog. Mr. Jones had originally written it as part of a collection of children's stories called Animal Tales. He turned it into a short opera for the Royal Opera House in London, England, last year when Anne Dudley, an Oscar-winning film and TV composer, approached him to collaborate on a work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It starts with a love song – what you think is a love song – and it turns out they're talking about their doctor,” he said, raising his eyebrows in amusement. “The medical council don't think he should continue practising, so he goes to try to reason with them. The commissionaire won't let him in because he's a dog. And he ends up biting the commissionaire on the leg and realizing that was a bad career move.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He stopped here for a little chuckle and another bite of fish, dabbing the corners of his mouth with his napkin before continuing. “And then he's in the dog pound, and there's another dog next to him who's headmaster at the local school, and another dog is a waitress in a café. And they're all about to be put down. So they sing this terribly sad song. It's funny but it's also very moving.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was much more. He will direct a movie, a science-fiction farce he co-wrote called Absolutely Anything, which will be voiced by ex-Pythons Mr. Gillam, Mr. Palin and John Cleese. We talked about more opera shorts he's doing for the summer Olympics in London. “The idea is to do opera in unexpected places, on a barge going down the Thames. I'm going to do The Owl and The Pussycat. It'll be just half an hour. And I'm doing what happened before they got on the boat. You're a bird marrying a cat? What on earth? There's a lot of drama there,” he said with evident satisfaction. And then there are the three books he published last year. Oh, and the heavy-metal version of The Nutcracker that he's working on with songwriter/producer Jim Steinman in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I enjoy it too much to stop working,” he concluded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, one more tidbit dropped out before the end of the conversation. “I need to pay my mortgage, too,” he confessed, his face all rubbery and rueful.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Something along the lines of what they now do for cigarettes. “Don't Poison Your Retirement,” would do the job, or maybe “Borrowing May Cause Poverty in Retirement.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stern measures are needed because the stress level over whether people are saving sufficiently for retirement has been kicked up a notch. Prime Minister Stephen Harper has announced plans to reform Canada's pension system and the likely outcome is that some people will receive less in government retirement benefits in the years ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk has focused so far on Old Age Security, which now pays up to $540 per month to people who are 65 and meet requirements for residency in Canada. One idea making the rounds has the government gradually increasing the age at which you can collect OAS to 67. It's conceivable the feds could also get more aggressive in clawing back OAS benefits paid to higher-income seniors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's certain is that our aging population necessitates action to ensure programs such as health care and public pensions are sustainable. Where there are now four tax-paying workers for every retiree, there will be just two by 2036, said Fred Vettese, chief actuary for the consulting firm Morneau Shepell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Something has to be done because of the changing demographics, and one place the government can look is OAS,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How perfect that the prime minister announced his pension reform plans on the same day last week that the <span class="companylink">Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</span> released a report saying that a growing share of highly indebted Canadians are over 45. As the report says, that's an age where “accumulating net assets ahead of retirement should be paramount.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've had infinite warnings about the dangers of debt, but they have mostly focused on the eventual day when interest rates rise from today's low levels. What's easily affordable now may become unaffordable then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mostly ignored risk is that too much money is going into debt payments at the expense of retirement savings. Sure, some people regularly contribute to their retirement savings and manage their mortgages and credit lines with discipline. But check out this nugget from a Statistics Canada report last month on contributions to registered retirement savings plans: “Almost 93 per cent of tax filers were eligible to contribute to an RRSP for the 2010 tax year, the same proportion as in 2009. Of this group of eligible tax filers, 26 per cent actually made contributions, unchanged from 2009.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few of these RRSP-avoiders may have decided that tax-free savings accounts are a better retirement savings vehicle. But it seems safe to say many people are spending at the expense of saving. Neglect of retirement saving is excusable when it results from job loss and related issues. But the CIBC report suggests that, as we look ahead to diminished government support for seniors, debt is swallowing up money that could otherwise be saved for retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Picture this a few years from now: The government has its spending on a sustainable track, while a generation of Canadians hit retirement age with barely enough money to scrape by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There certainly is a risk of this turning out badly,” said Bill Robson, president of the C.D. Howe Institute, a public policy think tank. He wonders if the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> should raise rates to discourage borrowing and encourage savings. Tricky though it might be to set up, he sees some potential in the idea of providing people with personalized retirement savings assessments that would tell them whether they need to save more for a comfortable retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting OAS at age 67 would certainly require people to save more if they wanted to retire at 65. Mr. Robson is among those who see people working around this by staying on the job until 67 or longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people will have to get more serious about saving money. They're the ones who are determined to retire at 65, who have health issues that will prevent them from working longer or whose employer or profession doesn't offer much opportunity for older workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In running investor focus groups on behalf of financial literacy initiatives, Brondesbury Group president Ed Weinstein has built a unique understanding of what people know about money matters. Or, rather, what they don't know. “I have very little faith in what people understand about saving for retirement,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial literacy may help to boost our retirement savings rate, but we need stronger, quicker action. Let's start with warning labels on lines of credit.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will come as a shock to exactly no one that this column is old to enough to remember when Michael Jackson first released thrilling and vital music.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was 1979. In this column's small corner of the world, at that time, before it had grown to column length and height and was merely a mini-paragraph, things were grim. At the top of the pop charts were the Boomtown Rats. wailing about not liking Mondays. This was dandy because the Rats were Irish and all, but the times were bleak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Margaret Thatcher had been elected in Britain. Murders and bombings came weekly in Northern Ireland. Pope John Paul II came to Ireland and priests who would later be named and castigated for their many sins helped him sell conservative Catholicism to the locals. This little band called U2 was making their first recording, having won some studio time in a talent contest. The result was the strange, aptly disturbing song Out of Control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Into this cornucopia of truculence came Michael Jackson's Off the Wall. The exuberance of it, the ecstatic assertion of joyous rhythm. It was astonishingly skilled and euphoric.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fast-forward some years and this column, all grown up, is dwelling on an E! special called The 25 Creepiest Couples of All Time. This list included Flavor Flav and Brigitte Nielsen, Liza Minnelli and David Gest, and Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley. Soon, Jackson's image was draped in the macabre and the grotesque. There was Jackson's unnerving, unhealthy and deeply creepy obsession with children. The lawsuits, trials and lurid exposés.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time of his death, Jackson was a ghoulish figure, diminished in every way by fame and success. The music, especially the early music, receded ever farther into some distant, perplexing past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is all by way of introducing tonight's Glee (Fox, Global, 8 p.m.) which is simply called Michael.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gist, in the Glee context, is that the McKinley glee-club singers plan to perform Michael Jackson songs for their set at Regionals. This info is accidentally revealed to their rivals, the Warblers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Warblers then plan on appropriating the Jackson songs. Also, Kurt and Rachel receive news from admissions at the Performing Arts Academy in New York. But that's not what matters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 10 Jackson songs are performed, many of them done in unique arrangements. The episode is, as so often with Glee, baffling and at times brilliant. For brilliance, watch the arrangement and execution of Jackson's Smooth Criminal, here performed only with cellos, and it is breathtaking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The use of Jackson's songs, in the Glee style of exultation and wide-eyed wonder at the power of music, is discombobulating. (And it's not a philosophical question about telling the dancer from the dance.) Some viewers will want to strenuously deny the music any of its vigour and appeal. It's okay to do that, to be unwilling to release the music from the macabre and disturbing ambience of Jackson's life, attitudes and actions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people can fetishize the grotesque all they want, but Jackson was still a ghoulish figure, profoundly off-putting in his proclivity for intense associations with children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others will see this Glee as some kind of eighties pop-fest, a dose of kitsch, all surface and silly copying of the Jackson originals. There will be online discussion of which Jackson covers and interpretations worked and which didn't. Obsessives will delight in it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truth, if a truth exists at all about pop music, is buried somewhere in the conundrum that is this Glee celebration of Jackson. This column found it interesting that memories of other times were evoked. Interesting but not necessarily comforting, like this episode of Glee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Airing TonightThis Hour Has 22 Minutes (CBC, 8:30 p.m.) pokes fun at the NDP leadership thing. This is good. Though not much gallivanting for the 22 Minutes crew as the Dippers had their recent “debate” down the road from the 22 Minutes base in Halifax. It's not a leadership race really, because, you know, nobody seems to be doing anything much. Also, Mark Critch plays chef Gordon Ramsay, who sets out to fix RIM's problems. Which is cute. And on Rick Mercer Report (CBC, 8 p.m.), Mercer has larks with Toronto with Canada's Olympic Trampoline Team. Also by the way, the show's ratings are steadily just over one million viewers, not “just hitting” one million as I wrote yesterday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's Sunday, Halifax. The New Democratic Party leadership candidates are in debate. The contest has been written off as a snoozefest thus far. All candidates holding hands. That sort of thing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There've been no surprises. Except Nathan Cullen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 39-year-old MP from northern British Columbia, bald as the hood on your Lexus, likes making bad-hair-day jokes. He delights the audience with one such offering, then turns serious on the question of retirement security. “The next time the Prime Minister wants to announce that he's going after seniors and does so in another country, he should stay there!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The applause meter rises with that broadside. It rises again with a Cullen projectile against the government's planned purchase of zillion-dollar warplanes. “For the price of just three of those jets we could lift every senior out of poverty in this country!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He moves on – servility to the oil industry. Although oil prices are at an all-time high, the Conservatives will subsidize companies $1.3-billion to develop the tar sands, he protests. Those rich companies “need nothing from this government!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the NDP race is a bore, it's not because of Mr. Cullen. In an eight-contestant race, standing out from the pack is a challenge. But Mr. Cullen is upstaging everyone. He's a skilled communicator, crisp and witty with an intensity of commitment. He's also not afraid to go – and this is seen as his weakness – where other NDPers fear to tread.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The race is about who can best stand up to Stephen Harper. Who has the strength, the intellect, the guts. Mr. Cullen is showing, along with Thomas Mulcair, that he might have it. Mr. Mulcair was a force again on Sunday. When Paul Dewar, no slouch as a candidate, challenged him on his position on bulk water exports, the Quebecker, with indignant precision, mercilessly took him apart. It was a crystallizing moment. Mr. Cullen was looking on as if to say, “Whew, did you see that?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The race is also about who can hold Quebec and Mr. Mulcair, the former Liberal Quebec cabinet minister, has it over the others on that qualification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the fight is also, as Mr. Cullen sees it, about more than just the health of the New Democratic Party. It's about all Canadian progressives and how they can find a way to stop the resolute march of their opposite number.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trilingual Mr. Cullen, who worked in community and economic development in Latin America and Africa, is the one leadership candidate running on a platform of co-operation with the Liberals. In ridings held by Conservatives, he wants the Grits and the NDP to pool their resources, holding joint nomination meetings to put up one opposing candidate. The modified merger plan is not to the liking of other contestants, who challenged Mr. Cullen on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listen, he told them, the Harper Conservatives have another four years and if progressives don't co-operate, it will be another eight. Do they really want to be around to see the kind of Canada that will have emerged by that time?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cullen referenced Mr. Mulcair's Liberal background. He said he didn't judge him with any suspicion on that basis, but only on the fact of their common ground as progressives. Mr. Mulcair got a bit testy, thinking Mr. Cullen was calling into question his NDP bona fides. He wasn't. He was saying they have a common world view and that was enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, what is important is that while they do not agree on merger options, both these strong candidates share the goal, more so than the others, of wishing to broaden the NDP tent to the Liberal middle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cullen is not likely to win. His modified-merger offering, while reasonable, alienates too many of the party's rank and file. He is ahead of his time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But come convention time in March, he could find himself in the role of kingmaker and, following it, deputy leader. If the party is looking for a powerhouse duo, it could do a lot worse than an east-west Mulcair-Cullen combination.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newest wine style from Canada's newest wine region is a beguiling nod to the past.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neon-pink, gently spritzy and moderately sweet, it might on the surface summon dreaded memories of Baby Duck-era “pop” wines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, I'm talking the distant past here, a handcrafted bubbly with pre-Champagne cachet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ancestral, from Hinterland Wine Co. in Ontario's Prince Edward County, follows a tradition kept alive by old-school producers in Bugey-Cerdon, a relatively obscure appellation in the Jura mountains of eastern France.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The name derives from méthode ancestrale, a technique that put fizz in French wine more than a century before the birth of Champagne as we know it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though it comes in a standard sparkling-wine bottle, Ancestral diverges from regal Champagne in one critical technical aspect, the source of its spritz. In short, there's one fermentation, not two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make Champagne, one must first produce a still wine, letting yeast feed on grape sugars to yield alcohol and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide becomes an unwanted byproduct, intentionally expelled through the top of the open fermentation tank. The bubbles come only later, during a secondary fermentation, induced by adding fresh sugar and yeast at the bottling stage. The micro-organisms once again feed off the sugar, as in the primary fermentation, only this time the carbon dioxide is trapped under pressure of the sealed bottle in a technique known as méthode champenoise, or the “traditional method.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With méthode ancestrale, producers instead play a game of early intervention, trapping carbon dioxide from the primary fermentation by bottling before the original yeast can finish its sugar-mopping job. It's a relatively rogue approach, because a winemaker can't easily control how much sugar and yeast are left in the tank at bottling. The results are inconsistent at best, but, some might argue, the wines come with their own idiosyncratic appeal. If méthode champenoise is digital precision, méthode ancestrale is a scratchy analogue LP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The method was pioneered in the southern Limoux region in the early to mid-1500s and is also used to produce spritzy moscato d'Asti in northwest Italy, arriving in Bugey more recently. In Limoux and Asti, however, ancestrale wines are all white, whereas in Bugey the technique is used for red – or, rather, delicately pink – wines based principally on light-coloured gamay, the same red variety used at Hinterland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's like neon lingerie,” Jonas Newman, Hinterland's co-owner, says of Ancestral's feminine, rose-petal hue. The flavour might be called seductive too, a tad sweeter than off-dry, evoking strawberries and watermelon as well as a grapey quality that would be familiar to anyone who has sampled still-bubbling grape must. “You want to bottle the flavours of fermentation,” Mr. Newman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technique is considered more “ancestral” than that of Champagne because bottled sparkling wine got its start this way, initially as a happy accident. In cool climates, yeast would occasionally become paralyzed as temperatures dropped in autumn, stalling the fermentation. Frustrated but undeterred, winemakers would bottle anyway. Then in spring the dormant yeast would awaken to feed anew inside the bottles. Froth was not the only surprise that would ensue. Because such early wines were contained in regular glass and sealed with conventional cylindrical corks versus the wire-collar contraptions of modern Champagne, unsuspecting cellar hands would often be forced to seek cover from flying corks and exploding glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As consumer taste for bubbles grew, producers began sourcing heavier glass to minimize collateral losses (and, presumably, liability claims). In Champagne, they also developed the secondary fermentation technique to introduce more precise and certain carbonation. After all, there was no guarantee the weather would co-operate to halt fermentation in autumn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's another advantage to the Champagne method. By precisely measuring sugar and yeast levels for the secondary fermentation, it's possible to insert just enough into the bottle to create a dry wine, with virtually no residual sugar. In the ancestrale technique, residual sugar is a virtual certainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Méthode ancestrale wines also tend to be lower in alcohol, roughly 8 to 9 per cent by volume. In fact, at 8.9 per cent, Hinterland's barely qualifies as wine under Ontario law. Lower than 7 per cent and it would fall ingloriously into the “wine cooler” category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Newman and his wife and business partner, Vicki Samaras, got the idea for the wine from a friend, John Gay, a Toronto-based sommelier turned wine merchant. Mr. Gay had been captivated by a hard-to-come-by Bugey he had begun selling to restaurants, imploring the couple to come taste. Ms. Samaras rushed to meet the merchant while the latter was on a sales call at Toronto's Granite Club. The pair popped a cork and “clinked” plastic cups in the tony private club's parking lot, and Ms. Samaras became smitten with the wine. (It probably helped that it was a hot day in July, perfect weather for a fizzy sweet wine.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be fair, Hinterland's wine (which sells for $23 direct from the winery) would not qualify for France's méthode ancestrale designation in the end. Rather than relying on the vagaries of ambient temperatures, Mr. Newman forcibly arrests fermentation by chilling the fermentation tank after achieving the desired sugar-yeast balance. In other words, he doesn't wait until spring to bottle, as they do in Bugey. He also filters out sediment prior to bottling, a necessary step to qualify for Ontario's Vintners Quality Alliance seal. (Turbidity is a no-no under VQA standards.) French appellation laws, by contrast, prohibit filtering where ancestrale is concerned, the dead-yeast sediment considered part of the wine's charm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hinterland produced just 4,000 bottles of Ancestral this year, double last year's maiden – and mainly experimental – vintage. Much will be sold to intrepid restaurant managers seeking something other than icewine to offer as a homegrown dessert partner. Fresh-fruit concoctions are a classic match, though moderately sweet cakes and cookies work well. David Loan, owner-manager at Zen Kitchen, a gourmet vegan restaurant in Ottawa's Chinatown district, plans to offer it on Valentine's Day with a tres leches cake, a spongy dessert made with milk. Ancestrale-style wines are little known, Mr. Loan says, but they “can be beautiful and lively – happiness in a glass.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps counterintuitively, Ancestral also would not be out of place with salty charcuterie, the wine's sweetness counterbalancing the salty-smoky quality of many cured meats. And Mr. Newman has his own favourite match. “It works awesome with curry,” he says, adding that the wine plays a yin-yang role similar to that of fruit-based chutneys in spicy Indian cuisine. Call it an untraditional pairing for a very traditional wine.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the afternoon of Feb. 18, 1893, Brother Alphonse Juin knocked on the door of the Abbey of Notre-Dame du Lac (known as Oka Abbey) in Deux-Montagnes, Que. The monastery was struggling, unable to make ends meet, and Brother Alphonse had been sent from the Abbaye de Bellefontaine in France (from which the Oka monks originated) with a recipe for Port-du-Salut cheese that might help them. Brother Alphonse tweaked and adjusted the Port-du-Salut recipe, creating a unique Quebec cheese that went on to win first prize at the Montreal Exhibition that same year and has since become a Canadian classic.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oka, a surface-ripened, semi-soft cheese, has the typical orange rind and expected pungency of the washed-rind style. It's buttery and creamy with mellow, nutty notes. The circumstances surrounding Oka's creation in 1893 are also a reminder of the tenacity and connectivity of the monastic community. This was a time when travelling even 50 kilometres would be a considerable challenge. The determination of the Bellefontaine Abbey to help the Canadian monks “is thrilling and captivating,” says Daphne Zepos, co-owner of the Cheese School in San Francisco. “I picture [the monastic community] like a pulsing organism with an incredible energy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rhythm of cheese-making combined well with the monastic life – it allowed time in between work for prayer and the divine lectures, Ms. Zepos explains. It was humble work that was a form of meditation and a pathway to God. Skills were passed from generation to generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1918 the Oka recipe was shared with the Cistercian Abbey of Our Lady of the Prairies in Holland, Man., but it was not until 1983, when agriculture could no longer sustain them, that the recipe was used. In the early years, Brother Albéric, the Manitoba cheese-maker, sent a sample of his cheese to the Quebec monks at the Oka Abbey. They wrote back saying something was “missing,” passing onto him a detailed notebook left by Brother Oswald who had been president of the Oka Dairy from 1924 to 1958.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the notebook were specific aging techniques (that created Oka's rich and aromatic quality) that were so sacred to Brother Oswald he had written, “if you stop making cheese one day or you no longer find these notes useful, don't give them to anyone, burn them. Do not reveal the secret.” This new cheese, made using Oka techniques, is known as Fromage de la Trappe and is still being produced in small batches at the abbey. Available only in Manitoba, if you can get your hands on a piece you'll find it generally more pungent and a little fuller-flavoured than the Quebec Oka.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1981, Agropur, a large dairy co-operative headquartered in Longueil, Que., became the sole producers of Oka when the Oka monks sold them the original recipe. Eric Korn, product manager for Agropur's fine cheese division, says that the cheese is still made in the same facility and ripened in the same aging rooms. Most of the staff have been making the Oka for more than 25 years – about 30 per cent have worked with the monks themselves. These older workers still remember the hand signals that the monks (who worked in silence during designated hours) would use to signify they had to go flip a cheese or wash it with brine. Parts of the process are now mechanized, but a cheese-maker still decides when a cheese is ripe or sticks his finger in the coagulated milk (gel) to judge if it is ready to be cut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just like the “secrets” from Father Oswald's notebook, though an official recipe exists, many techniques are not written down, they are passed along through cheese-makers. To maintain the proper microclimate in one of the ripening areas, the cheese-makers know exactly which corner of the room needs to be dampened with water. This kind of detail is not typical of a large-scale production, demonstrating the importance of human involvement, says Mr. Korn, and the importance of the environment is part of the ingredients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agropur's regular Oka is mild, fruity and aged only 18 to 21 days. But for a taste of the original recipe, look for the “Oka Classique” (orange label). It's sitting by my elbow as I type and I am surrounded by enticing, soft, barny aromas. Aged longer (minimum 60 days) it has a darker copper rind and a bolder flavour, well balanced and with a lovely, buttery linger.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians were shocked and saddened – rightly so – by the apparent suicides of two National Hockey League players last year. The tragic deaths set off a national debate about the mental health of hockey enforcers and the need to assist them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year in Nunavut, 33 people took their own lives. The youngest was a boy of 12. Will Canadians go through a similarly gut-wrenching debate? Will there be calls for prevention strategies and mental health summits?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Probably not. And yet there should be. Complacency is no way to support a community in crisis. “We must give our children reasons to have hope,” said Natan Obed, the acting president of a territorial suicide-prevention organization. “We must transform our society and overcome the root causes of suicide for the next generation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government of Nunavut has already introduced suicide prevention training in schools, and announced a number of other specific initiatives in a plan released last year. But a greater sense of urgency is needed. Those who are suffering from mental illness, or momentary despair, need support, and concrete alternatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1969, the suicide rate in Nunavut was actually lower than it was in the rest of Canada; now it is 12 times higher, with the greatest gap for teenage boys. More people took their own lives in 2011 than in any other year in the territory's history, except for 2003. Two-thirds were under the age of 24. People who attempt suicide are not necessarily mentally ill, but may be suffering from anxiety or depression. At particular risk are youths who have had painful childhood experiences, including neglect or physical or sexual abuse, and who abuse alcohol or drugs. The trauma of seeing friends die can also cause a cluster of suicide attempts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government of Nunavut must invest more in mental health services, and build a residential addictions-treatment facility in Iqaluit. More help lines are needed, as are counsellors and doctors who live in the community, instead of fly-in psychiatrists. Expanded early-childhood programs would also help young people learn the life skills they need to cope with stress and disappointment, and learn how to regulate their emotions and interact with the world. But it would certainly help if Nunavut's youth knew the rest of Canada cared about their well-being, too.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 1956, an eager 11-year-old boy entered the record department at Woodward's in downtown Vancouver. He asked the clerk for My Prayer by the Platters.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I clutched my dollar in hand to get this record,” remembers Brian Tarling. “She told me they were sold out. I was absolutely devastated.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the era of the 78 revolution-per-minute record, a dinner-plate-sized platter of black shellac. The lad wondered if there were any copies in that newfangled format, the 45 rpm single.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“She went back, thumbing through a little box of 45s. And there it was!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the year Elvis Presley made his continental television debut. In January, Elvis the Pelvis released what would be his first No. 1 hit. By the end of the year, he had nine singles on the Billboard Hot 100 and popular music was forever changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Vancouver, the local newspapers recognized this crazy, new rock 'n' roll stuff was taking off with the young set. They began canvassing local disc jockeys for their top picks of the week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the most influential of these wax spinners was Red Robinson, the hyperkinetic boy deejay of radio station CJOR. Mr. Robinson soon after moved to CKWX, brought Elvis and the Beatles to town, and became a legend in his own right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The popular jockey's Top 10 picks were soon joined by charts produced by rival stations, which offered longer selections called the “Hi-Fi Forty,” the “Funtastic Fifty,” and the “Sensational Sixty.” There was also a “Boss 30” and a “Silver Dollar Survey,” over the years producing an avalanche of songs and artists and record labels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boy who bought the Platters' single grew up to be a chartered accountant. When he retired six years ago, he began a project that only recently came to tutti-frutti fruition – a compilation of every song charted by radio stations in Vancouver from 1956 to 1978.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is a self-published volume as thick as a telephone directory. The book lists 7,700 hits by 2,400 artists, from the Beatles to one-hit wonders. The songs are listed by artist, once again by year, and alphabetically by title. You can find out when the tune entered the charts, its peak position, how long it held the peak position, number of weeks (if any) it was in the Top 10, as well as the original Canadian label and catalogue number. The 654-page, $60 paperback book, with the utilitarian title Vancouver's Charted Songs, '56 to '78, tells you just about everything except the brand of car in which the artists cruised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designed for fellow record-collector hobbyists, it holds within its practical pages all you need to know about such songs as Boogie Bear (Boyd Bennett), Boogie Child (Bee Gees), Boogie Fever (Sylvers), Boogie Nights (Heatwave), Boogie on Reggae Woman (Stevie Wonder), and Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy (Bette Midler).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A special delight is in coming across such forgotten (forgettable? – ed.) novelties as Brontosaurus Stomp by The Piltdown Men, a Hollywood instrumental group with duelling saxophonists who charted briefly in 1960 after the debut of the animated prime-time sit-com, The Flintstones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The painstaking task demanded an accountant's t-crossing, i-dotting attention to detail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I've always been interested in the charts and the numbers and how the songs did,” Mr. Tarling said. “And I like the music.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Elvis man, the 66-year-old collector began his task of compiling chart information about the same time that a fellow rock fan, Jim Bower, launched a website featuring Top 40 songs from Vancouver stations. Mr. Tarling was also assisted by Larry (Firedog) Morton, a retired Vancouver fire department captain who had grown up taping songs off the radio with a reel-to-reel tape recorder. The big hits heard on the radio were joined by popular local acts such as The Prowlers (with Les Vogt, whose The Blamers knocked Elvis off the top of the Vancouver charts in 1960) and The Chessmen (featuring rhythm guitarist Terry Jacks, later to have a monster smash with – ear-worm warning – Seasons in the Sun). Add a dash of Pacific Northwest bands and a pinch of British Invasion, and the city's radio mix was unlike that heard elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The book includes listings for 1,700 songs that charted in Vancouver but did not make Billboard's Hot 100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tarling estimates only five per cent of charted songs were Canadian before the introduction of mandatory Canadian content in 1971. Afterwards, about one in five charting songs were homegrown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Tarling's book can be ordered at vancouverschartedsongs.ca. Jim Bower's website is vancouvertop40radio.com. Any fan of the local scene will want to cruise over to Red Robinson's blog at redrobinson.com/blog/.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no shortage of diet plans promising to melt away the pounds by calling for strict proportions of protein, carbohydrate and fat.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, according to a new study, it doesn't matter where the calories come from. What matters most for shedding body fat is simply eating fewer calories – and sticking to your plan, be it high protein, low carb or low fat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some, but not all, studies have demonstrated that high protein, low carbohydrate diets work better than others at losing fat and preserving muscle mass over the short term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also debate over which diets, if any, are most effective for reducing visceral fat, deep abdominal fat that's closely related to the harmful metabolic effects of obesity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Visceral fat packs itself around the organs and secretes chemicals that increase the body's resistance to the hormone insulin and cause inflammation throughout the body.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current study – called the Pounds Lost trial – was led by the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana. It set out to determine whether the composition of a weight loss diet affected the loss of lean muscle, total body fat, abdominal fat, visceral fat or liver fat in 424 overweight or obese men and women. (Excess visceral fat is thought to release fat into the bloodstream causing a build-up of fat in the liver.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Participants were assigned to one of four diets: 1) low fat (20 per cent daily calories), average protein (15 per cent); 2) low fat (20 per cent), high protein (25 per cent); 3) high fat (40 per cent), average protein (15 per cent); or 4) high fat (40 per cent), high protein (25 per cent).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each diet was low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in fibre, included low glycemic carbohydrates and was designed to cut 750 calories a day. All participants were offered group and individual counselling sessions over two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Body fat and muscle mass was measured using CT (computed tomography) scanning after six months and two years of follow up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the six-month mark, participants had lost, on average, more than nine pounds of total body fat along with five pounds of lean muscle, but had regained some of this after two years. Fat loss or muscle loss did not differ between the four diet groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As well, the proportion of protein, carbohydrate or fat in the diet did not affect the amount of abdominal fat, visceral fat or liver fat that was lost during the study. After six months, participants shed about 40 per cent of visceral fat and 60 per cent of liver fat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the two-year follow-up, people were able to maintain a weight loss of more nine pounds, including three pounds of abdominal fat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bottom line for the study: The major factor for weight loss was adherence to a calorie-re-duced diet, not the proportion of carbohydrate, protein or fat it contained. People who followed their diets better lost more weight and body fat than those who didn't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These findings strongly suggest you're better off choosing a plan that's easy to stick to over the long haul – provided, of course, it's a healthy diet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An earlier report from the Pounds Lost trial revealed that all four diets were heart-healthy regardless of their protein, carbohydrate and fat content. Each diet reduced levels of triglycerides (blood fats), LDL (bad) cholesterol, lowered blood pressure and increased HDL (good) cholesterol.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, most people in weight loss programs gradually revert to their previous diets over time even if they do manage to maintain some fat loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're 2012 goal is to shed excess body fat, the following tips will help you adhere to a healthy diet plan and increase the likelihood of success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plan in advance</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the most common blunder that steers people off-track: not being organized. On the weekend, spend a few minutes thinking about the week ahead. Map out your meals, healthy snacks and even your workouts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If scheduling a week's worth of meals seems overwhelming, plan for only one or two days in advance. Planning ahead means you'll be less likely to give in to temptation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be assertive</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Learn to say no. Whether that means turning down sweets at the office or asking a server to hold the buttery sauce, being assertive will get you closer to your goal. Changing your eating habits is within your power; nobody else is going to do it for you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart your progress</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more monitoring you do – and feedback you get – the better you'll do. Keep a daily food and exercise diary. Track your weight weekly and your body measurements monthly (e.g. waist, hips, chest). Charting progress provides awareness, focus and motivation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anticipate roadblocks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't expect to be perfect – there are bound to be a few glitches along the way. Make change easier by listing potential obstacles – junk food in the house, grocery shopping on an empty stomach, skipping breakfast and so on. Identifying trouble spots makes it easier to avoid them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider lapses as momentary setbacks, not the ruin of all your hard work. All-or-nothing thinking is a detriment to success. If you allow yourself to lapse occasionally, rather than beating yourself up, you'll be much more likely to pick up where you left off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reward successes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't hold off on congratulating yourself until you reach your final weight goal. Every small success deserves at pat on the back. Rewarding yourself as you meet interim goals is a way to remind yourself that you can do it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Follow up with yourself</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once you've reached your goal, don't get smug. Just because your clothes feel great, or your cholesterol is in the healthy range, doesn't mean you can get away with second helpings or an extra dessert each week. It's a slippery slope that will lead you back to your starting point.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is one of those things that will be tucked away in the back of Dwane Casey's mind for a time when the games carry a little more meaning.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the rest of us, it's a reminder that the head coach of the Toronto Raptors is not above trying to force the issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was necessity – specifically, the absence of Andrea Bargnani and a tendency toward slow first quarters – that caused Casey to start DeMar DeRozan at the small forward spot last Sunday in a 94-73 win over the New Jersey Nets. DeRozan, normally a two guard, was back at small forward Tuesday, in what would turn out to be a 100-77 loss to the Atlanta Hawks at the Air Canada Centre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Casey once again went with a small lineup, starting both Jerryd Bayless and Jose Calderon in addition to DeRozan, James Johnson and Amir Johnson, to little effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hawks outscored Toronto 33-19 in the second quarter, shooting 66.7 per cent and catching the Raptors repeatedly in transition, en route to a 56-37 half-time lead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They started to take care of the ball in the second half – four turnovers, after 11 in the first – which helped them withstand a noticeable drop off in second-half shooting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Larry Drew, the Hawks head coach, would later say he was concerned coming into the game because of the pace at which the Raptors play with their smaller lineup. But he also knew he'd find a mismatch if both Calderon and Bayless were in the game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Somebody was going to have to guard one of our big guys,” Drew said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Casey, who went big to start the second half, said the smaller lineup gives him much-needed ball movement. “It gives us two facilitators in Jerryd and Jose and it also allows DeMar to run a little bit more,” the coach said. “It may not work against Boston [the Raptors play the Celtics on Wednesday in Boston] or against big guys like LeBron [James of the Miami Heat] or Paul Pierce [of the Celtics].”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the compressed NBA season, necessitated by the lockout, there is a sense 2011-12 is going by in a blur. There is a sense that we are still trying to get to know Casey (this was only the eighth home game in Toronto's first 22), but coming into the Hawks game, the Raptors had held their last three opponents (the Phoenix Suns, Utah Jazz and Nets) below their season-scoring average. The Raptors bench, meanwhile, averaged 43.2 points in five games – 11 above its season average – and had overcome a pair of double-digit deficits for victories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Defence and bench scoring? That's coaching, folks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DeRozan hasn't had the type of season either he or the team expected. But there's been a lot going on; a lot to assimilate and process. He had his best game of the season last Sunday, with a season-high 27 points and a career-high 16 free-throws. That is a game Casey and the coaching staff will save on their laptop files – in many ways it was a game to grow on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This one, not so much. DeRozan finished with nine points and was 3-for-9 from the field.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Casey and his assistants will continue to preach the need to attack the basket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Get to alleys,” he said. “Recognize going to the hole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We want him to go at guys,” Casey said. “Go at the shoulder. Don't veer, don't avoid contact. I'm a big believer that in any sport, you can't have fear of going to a guy's body. You want him to almost treat it like a football hole, and bust through and get to the rim.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It might have been equal parts desperation and inspiration, but if it gets DeRozan taking his game to the messy areas of the court, if it can be a key to unlocking his potential, the small forward's role might be something Casey files away for a future quarter.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Male authoritarianism and control are deeply embedded in many cultures. A close study of Canada's South Asian communities will reveal that male authoritarian inclinations are hidden deep beneath the displays of higher education and affluence. The greatest facilitators of this control are women themselves, who are coerced into silent acceptance. The convictions in the Shafia trial present an opportunity to lead the examination to the correct place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Sunday's conviction spread around the country, it released a gamut of emotional responses. Vilification, affirmation of human rights, grief for three beautiful teenagers and a spurned first wife. Justice had to be meted out and so it was. Meanwhile, the ready acceptance that this murder came from the mind of an Afghan patriarch gave air to a fabricated concept that the act was linked to a light-filled term called “honour.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Honour is associated with acts of chivalry, gallantry and a nebulous adherence to something old-world. One thinks of a jousting match in medieval era, a mounted knight tying a lady's scarf to his lance. He must win because he has been favoured with the lady's token. Brought into this century, it can be equated to self-image or self-worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no “honour” concept in Muslim communities, but there is a long-standing belief that a family's reputation is dependent on the behaviour of all its family members. (This is never articulated openly; the subject is taboo.) A large number of people belonging to South Asian communities in Canada believe that women of Judeo-Christian cultures are the worst role models. They have sexual freedom, they wear indecent clothing, they have children as single mothers, they demand equality in every aspect of life – this is not what these communities desire for their daughters. The rise of South Asian matrimonial dating and marriage websites in the West is not as innocent as it may appear. It all has to do with choosing one kind of woman over another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Domestic violence notwithstanding, there is little Canada can do about this deeply concealed attitude reflected privately by such immigrants. Judicial, correctional and educational institutions are incapable of influencing these views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In these communities, gays hide their orientation, young women hide their sexual activity and all young adults hide alcohol consumption from their families. “If my parents knew, they would kill me,” is a phrase that has tripped from the mouths of many of them during the university years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Afghanistan, Mr. Shafia could have easily locked his daughters at home if they disobeyed him. In Canada, the solution was to kill. This is nothing to do with any arcane etiquette that Canadians must grasp and accept – it is a simple, repugnant example of social hypocrisy, the exercise of control through misogyny, culminating in a crime. Instead of wasting time and words talking about “honour killing,” such crimes should be dealt with swiftly, backed by the full weight of the justice system. No translators or culture experts are required.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The father who feels let down, even inferior because his pretty young daughters have boyfriends, wear makeup and may not bag the right Afghan husband should emigrate not to Canada but to some backward country that can offer him face-saving solutions. Mr. Shafia should have stayed in Dubai, his previous home, and Canadian immigration authorities should have examined the family's financially leveraged entry criteria more thoroughly.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has come to the attention of this column that a two-person battle is being waged in the TV racket. The battle is about who is the cutest, coolest most fashionable lady. Also the battle is about the cutest posterior. Both women contestants are creatures of television. They are Kim Kardashian and Pippa Middleton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It ill behooves a man to enter the fray. So I will merely set out the facts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One recent evening, burdened by troubles big and small, I was watching Say Yes to the Dress before retiring for the night. It is a reliable relaxant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An excited – sometimes an agitated – bride-to-be goes to the store to buy a wedding dress. She brings a posse: gal-pals, mom, dad and bridesmaids, or old friends, a sister or two and, sometimes a gay guy from work whose eye for sartorial splendour has been well established. The dynamics are fascinating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On this occasion, along came a lady from Florida, not in the first flush of youth, as they say. Her requirement was specific – she wanted a Pippa Middleton dress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The store had none. Compromises were sought. One fluffy, feathered thingy was tried. It made her look like Big Bird, she declared, but her friend liked it a lot. Dark looks were exchanged. And then I fell asleep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next thing I know, days later, is that Pippa Middleton is the most hotly desired guest on American TV in 2012. According to reports, Oprah and Barbara Walters are waving cheques for enormous accounts of money at Pippa. (The money will go to a charity of her choice.) Some reports suggest they hang round her house in London making goo-goo eyes at her and leaving mash notes about how great her upcoming book is – it's about party-planning – and promising to totally be her BFF. Is this Pippa Middleton a star, or what?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We await developments on the big U.S. TV interview. Whenever it happens and to whom she talks will be huge, huge news and this column will fill you in, have no fear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, I noted with interest that the Season 2 finale of Kourtney &amp; Kim Take New York was E! Canada's most-watched single broadcast of a regular series in network history. It was announced that “A total audience of 252,000 viewers tuned in to see Kim share her heartbreak over the demise of her short-lived 72-day marriage to husband Kris Humphries with the world…” In the United States, many millions watched it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">E! declared, “The Kardashian reign continues on E!” Excuse me? Did I see anyone on Say Yes to the Dress ask for a Kim Kardashian ensemble? No. In fact I put it to E! that the “Kardashian reign” is over and Ms. Pippa Middleton is the new reigning queen of this world, whatever world it actually is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both are famous, thanks to TV. It was television's focus on Ms. Middleton's dress at the royal wedding last year that made her a superstar. The bod, the dress, the style. As they say on the flibbertigibbet side of what passes for entertainment journalism these days, a new “It Girl” was instantly created. Hence cheque-waving by Oprah and Barbara Walters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kardashian named Kim is entirely a creature of TV. Those reality shows about the busy shopping-and-dating lives of the Kardashian/Jenner family are huge. Exactly why I cannot tell you. Me, I cannot tell one Kardashian from another. Now, if one of them appeared on Say Yes to the Dress, it would be a different story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet I do know about the rear-end thing. I gather Kim Kardashian's posterior is a subject of rabid interest and discussion. Certain ladies want one just like it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simultaneously, Ms. Middleton's posterior is also much mulled over. In fact, when I sought online info about her possible appearance on some U.S. talk show, the first news story I saw had the headline, “Will Pilates give you bum like Pippa Middletons [sic]?” It was in the Belfast Telegraph, a paper in a place where peculiarity abounds. But it also appeared all over Britain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was much reference to Ms. Middleton's “internationally renowned hour-glass figure,” which I doubt is her proudest boast in terms of life achievement, but there you go. It's what happens today when you show up on TV in a nice dress looking slim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reference to Pilates unnerved me. I do Pilates. Sometimes there are ladies present. Being a gentleman and mainly interested in exorcising the body-strain that comes with this daily toil, I avert my eyes. If someone were to ask me, “Will Pilates give you bum like Pippa Middletons?” I could not advise. But I'd wager that Ms. Middleton's long history of doing triathlons might be a sound guide to finding an answer to the question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's February now. And this is how the rest of 2012 will unfold in certain areas on the TV racket – as a battle between Kim Kardashian and Pippa Middleton for supremacy in the cutest, coolest most fashionable lady stakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nitwits take note. And you others, I know there's an inner nitwit trying to get out.</p>
