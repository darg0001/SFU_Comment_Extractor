<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vic Toews, Canada's Public Safety Minister, has drawn the battle lines in the debate over the policing of cyberspace in the following way: There will be those who stand with the government's Protecting Children From Internet Predators Act, and those who stand “with the child pornographers.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best word to describe the minister's utterance is “silly.” It is unworthy of our Parliament and stands no chance of intimidating critics of the new bill, which was tabled on Tuesday. The proposed law takes important first steps in better equipping police to combat digital crime, while also struggling to protect the rights of Canadians. There is no reason for either side to demonize the other in this critical debate. What's needed is rational discussion.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much is being made of the provision that would force telecommunications companies to hand over – on request and without a warrant – a targeted subscriber's name, address, phone number, e-mail address, Internet protocol address and the name of the Internet service provider, as long as there were reasonable grounds to believe a crime was about to be committed. No one denies officials need to move quickly when chasing electronic data, which can be erased with the click of a mouse. With proper checks and balances, is this kind of sweeping power acceptable to Canadians if it could prevent the luring of a child by a sexual predator, an act of terrorism or the transmission of a malevolent computer virus?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law would also force telecommunications companies to install equipment that would allow authorities to monitor its users' activities, the monitoring limited to cases where a crime is suspected and requiring a warrant. Does this go too far, or is it necessary to combat the potential for Swiss-bank-style service providers whose unsavoury clients are guaranteed anonymity?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are good questions, Mr. Toews. When it comes to balancing criminal law with the rights of individuals, anyone who does so in good faith is standing with the angels.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His recent visit to China might be called The Education of Stephen Harper.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Far from the truculent finger-pointing that once characterized his government's attitude to China – an attitude it still displays elsewhere – Mr. Harper buried whatever criticisms he made of China's terrible human-rights record in closed-door meetings. In public, it was all sweetness and light, trade deals and photo ops with pandas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese, almost in passing, mentioned perhaps an eventual free-trade deal, to which Mr. Harper correctly replied that the issue was way too complicated for any early decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese are keen on free trade in goods, where they enjoy a massive advantage, and on raw materials, for which they display a voracious appetite. They aren't so keen on discussing intellectual property (stealing patents or insisting on getting them in joint ventures is endemic in China), government procurement, competition policy or anything else that might jeopardize the state-capitalist firms that dominate the Chinese economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So forget a Canada-China free-trade deal any time soon, which leaves Canada holding an empty bag in the Asia-Pacific theatre. For all the government's talk about Asia's importance, and despite the Prime Minister's China trip, not much is happening on the trade liberalization front for Canada in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Negotiations with South Korea have stalled, although the Koreans have opened up their market to Canadian beef exports after a long period of rejecting them on phytosanitary grounds. Ontario's auto industry objects to a South Korea deal, saying the Koreans won't FREE TRADEgive adequate domestic market access to cars made here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Korea has signed a free-trade deal with the U.S., so some Canadian exporters will be at a disadvantage in the Korean market. And having secured that big deal, Seoul would see any deal with Canada to be small beer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bilateral talks about maybe doing something with Japan are going nowhere fast. Japan is focused on joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations rather than doing anything bilaterally with any country, including Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TPP is the best trade negotiating table in the Asia-Pacific region, except that Canada lacks a seat. The Harper government says it wants one – Canadian officials were in New Zealand on Tuesday – but some of the participants don't want Canada there, as explained in a recent C.D. Howe Institute paper by Laura Dawson. The major reason is Canada's protectionist supply-management system for certain agricultural products (eggs, poultry, dairy), shielded behind astronomically high tariffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TPP started with four small countries. It has expanded to nine, including the U.S. and Australia. Japan and Mexico now want to join. The six countries of the nine in the TPP with which Canada lacks trade deals account for $4-billion in exports for Canada. Canada's exports with Japan and Mexico amount to $14-billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By not joining the TPP, Canada largely forgoes a chance to export more to those countries. Not joining would also risk some existing Canadian exports being displaced in these markets, as will likely happen in South Korea. If the TPP takes off, other Asia-Pacific countries will want to join.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the TPP's early years, Canada considered a possible deal among four small countries of little interest but woke up when the U.S. joined. Even then, the government was all over the map. Ministers played down Canada's interest, while Canadian diplomats were instructed to seek an invitation for Canada to join.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then-trade minister Peter Van Loan kept saying last year that Canada was still pondering whether to join, whereas it wasn't clear that Canada would even be invited. Now Mr. Harper has said publicly that Canada wants in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except the U.S. isn't sure what's to be gained by Canadian entry, even though the Harper government is counting on the U.S. to bulldoze our entry. New Zealand doesn't want Canada if we insist as a pre-condition that protection for supply management remains untouchable. Australia, playing a smart game, keeps saying publicly it would like Canada present but would shed no tears if it didn't happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not for the first time, and likely not for the last, Canada's national interests are being sacrificed to protect supply management.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A wine's flavour can suggest many things besides grapes: blackberries, vanilla, citrus, chocolate, herbs, even tar or hay. It's all in the mind (and sometimes merely in the crazed craniums of wine critics).</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's a new style of South African red that leaves little doubt as to what's on offer. It has been dubbed coffee pinotage and the flavour has <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> written all over it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the labels on most brands provide the first not-so-subtle clue. There's Barista, Cappuccino Pinotage, Café Culture, Coffee Pinotage, The Bean and The Grinder, to name a few. It's enough to make you reach for an espresso cup in lieu of fancy stemware.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several brands were recently launched in various provinces across Canada, ramping up the coffee-wine buzz that has been building since the launch of the first such example, Diemersfontein Pinotage, a decade ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on South Africa's signature red grape, pinotage, the phenomenon is the accidental brainchild of Bertus Fourie, Diemersfontein's former winemaker. A master's graduate in oenology from the University of Stellenbosch, Mr. Fourie had specialized in the effects of wood aging on wine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By lining steel tanks with heavily charred French-oak staves (the secret is in the temperature and duration of toasting) and fermenting with a special strain of yeast, the wine developed an uncanny essence of espresso as well as chocolate. (A similar thing happens with other varieties, but not to the same degree as with pinotage.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That first wine was an instant hit in South Africa, earning Mr. Fourie the nickname “<span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>.” Each year, it's celebrated with an annual rock-festival launch party attended by thousands on the Diemersfontein estate in Wellington near Cape Town. “It has a kind of a life of its own in the marketplace,” David Sonnenberg, the winery's owner, says on the phone from South Africa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cult soon spread far beyond the Cape. Mr. Sonnenberg's Ontario importer, Dan Rabinovitch of Azureau Wine Agency, says a man called from Texas recently asking if he could purchase a case on a visit to Toronto. (It's available only in five U.S. states.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After six years at Diemersfontein, Mr. Fourie moved to a larger winery, KWV, to produce Café Culture. Now, he's at Val de Vie, where he recently launched Barista, competing in an increasingly crowded market of coffee-cats and choc-offs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hoping to build on the success of its $20 original, Diemersfontein recently expanded its portfolio with the more explicitly named, and affordable, Coffee Pinotage for select markets (not yet available in Canada). The Swedish liquor monopoly instantly ordered 30,000 cases, a huge purchase for a single wine. “They felt there was a real consumer interest in that style of wine,” Mr. Rabinovitch said. “It's fuelling our optimism. We think this style has broad appeal and has the potential to elevate the profile of pinotage.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be frank, the grape could use some elevating. Developed in the 1920s as a cross between pinot noir and cinsault, it's a love-it-or-hate-it variety. The best wines are vibrantly fruity, with rich berry-like flavour and a gutsier attack than pinot noir. Imagine pinot as a welterweight with fancy footwork and pinotage as Smokin' Joe Frazier with a solid left hook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, smoke could be a euphemism for one of its more contestable attractions, less generously described as burnt rubber or, if you're a mechanic, overheated rad hose. When the grapes are picked too early, the wine can be pungent and acidic, with an aroma suggesting acetone or nail-polish remover. But many of the more expensive renditions steer clear of those qualities, and I enjoy the more refined pinotages, which still possess the punch to spar with gamey meats, even spicy wings and chili.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fourie's approach, which includes assiduous stirring during fermentation to amplify the fruit against all that oak, essentially helps to mask unbecoming nuances. The resulting wines are creamy and succulent enough that many people might be inclined to enjoy them between meals, although chili and barbecued ribs can be fine companions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Predictably, the coffee craze has sparked controversy. Starched-shirt guardians of wine's romantic allure are quick to dismiss the chemistry-set approach as an insult to an agricentric beverage. In snobspeak, coffee pinotage may be the ultimate anti-terroir wine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a collector with a passion for earthy, simply made Burgundies, I should find myself in the detractors' camp, but I don't. Many of the world's great wines are treated with prolonged exposure to new, toasted oak, including $2,000-a-bottle Romanée-Conti. They may not pick up much coffee, but they acquire other foreign flavours, such as vanilla and spice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taste Caymus Cabernet Sauvignon 2009, a $70 Napa Valley red available in Ontario, British Columbia and Nova Scotia, and you would almost be justified in wondering whether it had been pressed directly from vanilla, cocoa and coffee beans. It's a mocha bomb, and collectors love it – at 3½ times the price of the Diemersfontein. But, of course, the Caymus shrewdly displays a grape leaf on its label rather than a coffee cake with vanilla icing and chocolate sprinkles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sonnenberg describes his coffee wine as “fun,” a gateway beverage that is attracting new, and especially younger, consumers to the grape. I'd take it over a java chip frappuccino most days, even in the morning.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Grammy Awards was great, wasn't it? Such singers, such songs. The divas, the debauched, the faintly talented and the very famous. Songs of love and songs of desire. Songs of triumph and songs written by some anonymous committee of music-industry weasels that require the singer to give the impression he or she is aware what the song is about. That kind of thing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What was missing was songs about critters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, at you average country-music awards event, you're sure to find songs about critters. A lonesome dog, a handsome horse, a favourite cow. A staple of country is the song about a critter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I put it to you that not only are there not enough songs about critters, but there aren't enough critters on TV. A good, sweet critter could save a TV show on the brink of cancellation. People appreciate a critter. In fact, I also put it to you that, as suggestions are made that <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> is on the brink of defeating television as an entertainment source, what <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> has going for it is critters. Cats playing the piano. Cats doing the ironing. Doggies making friends with giraffes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As I write this on a cold afternoon with snow faintly falling, The Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show is unfolding on Animal Planet. It is highly entertaining, cheerful and wacky. I have learned much. Confident and with a lively bearing, that's your Icelandic sheepdog. Stuff like that. And I have been introduced to the Briard, a large, powerful herding dog that looks fabulous as his handler twirls him around in front of the judges. Apparently Napoleon had a Briard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you've missed it on Animal Planet, a channel not everyone subscribes to, don't worry. The entire dog extravaganza is repeated, first on Discovery World, Thursday and Friday at 8 p.m., and then on the Discovery Channel, Saturday and Sunday at noon. According to Animal Planet, the Westminster dog show is its “No. 1 marquee broadcast event and the television experience of the year for dog lovers across Canada and around the world.” The only thing more popular is The Puppy Bowl, I'd wager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further, in researching the deep and abiding appeal of critters on TV, I came across an interesting footnote. So, I ask you, what show featured the following array of distinguished Canadian and international talent – Al Waxman, John Ireland, Megan Follows, Alan Hale Jr., August Schellenberg, DeForest Kelley, Ray Walston, Michael Ironside, Patrick Macnee, Abe Vigoda, Saul Rubinek, John Vernon, Chris Makepeace, Karen Kain, Vic Morrow, Henry Gibson, John Carradine, Leslie Nielsen and Mike Myers? The answer is The Littlest Hobo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My point, and I do have one today, is that a good deal of mainstream TV is repetitive, off-putting and sometimes repulsive. And that's just the commercials. The characters are worse. Anybody been watching the crock of rude and faintly racist jokes on 2 Broke Girls (Mondays at 8:30 p.m. on CBS and CITY-TV)? What makes 2 Broke Girls occasionally watchable is a horse. The horse, the property of riches-to-rags girl Caroline (Beth Behrs), has been used as material for a multitude of rude jokes, but it humanized two characters who were quickly becoming ciphers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the thing about critters. They humanize the viewer and humanize characters, making palatable the cardboard cutouts who populate so much of TV. More critters, please.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airing Tonight</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lone Twin (TVOntario, 9 p.m.) is a wonderful, richly textured examination of the strange, emotional world of twins. Filmmaker Anna Van der Wee, whose twin brother Dirk died in an accident at age 20, says she has since asked herself, “Am I still a twin?” To find out more about her sense of identity, she went to several countries to interview twins and talk to those who have studied the relationships between twins. In the Netherlands, two young women, twins, sit together and one says, “This unconditional relationship we have is very hard to find in others.” And her sister nods. In Toronto, twins Denise and Michael Wilson talk about a friendship in which they can finish each other's sentences. It turns out that several experts interviewed are twins themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Love Addict: Not a Love Story (CBC NN, 10 p.m. on The Passionate Eye) is a sometimes chilling examination of people addicted to romantic love. An English-language, Danish production by Pernille Rose Gronkjaer, it's a series of vignettes or case studies of people who became too attached to the emotional high of romantic love and neglected everything else. Best not watched if you were made even slightly morose by Valentine's Day, it is sometimes heart-wrenching about fragile, angry and unhappy people.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the CBC changed Radio 2 in 2007, eliminating most of its classical-music programming and provoking debate, some commentators, particularly younger ones, scorned the whole discussion: “Why are we talking about radio?” they said.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who listens to radio? Everyone gets their music online now; even in their cars, people plug in their minuscule phones and players. Why should we fund an entire expensive radio station that will cater only to those too old to know how to connect their computers to their stereos?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, indeed, the CBC promised, at that time, to replace the daily stream of classical music on the radio with an even wider variety of Web offerings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has only just got around to doing that, on its English-language side. And as with all things going digital – news, books, movies – there are going to be some pros and cons to the transition. Uninterrupted, un-hosted, 24-hour music on the Web is a fantastic gift to those who already know their tastes. But it narrows your taste too: The presentation of music in niches keeps you listening to what you already know. And it's not ridiculous to mourn the disappearance of the informed, passionate curator – the voices we had on music radio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is now much more classical music available on the CBC's music site than there was on the old Radio 2. But it is presented in the way the Internet does things: in niches. So far, there are 10 new channels, with titles like Operatic, Baroque, Piano, Modern Masters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compare this cataloguing style with that of the classical section at Espace.mu – the French CBC music streaming site, which has been online for some time now. There, music channels are defined by theme: You can select Zen for quiet music, Vitaminé for something light and lively, Tempête for the muscular and serious. I suspect that this is the way most people want to program their music – by atmosphere rather than by instrument or era.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are wondrous advantages to Web streaming over radio: There is no folksy chatter (listeners of Tempo on Radio 2 will know how destructive that can be to one's reflective mood), you can switch channels if you don't like a piece, and if you want to know the details about what is playing, you just look at the screen. And there are more obscure genres than would ever be played on the mainstream CBC – there is even an electronic section with the kind of club dance music that has always terrified and baffled the public broadcaster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why would anyone miss radio?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I suppose because one might miss the idea of a person, an educated person, enlightening you in an intimate way, saying: Here is the mood I am in, let me share it with you. Or saying, simply, why the year 1804 was so important and this is why you should listen to this symphony about it, or here's where you should hear the theme recapitulated. Even in non-classical music: The screen tells you you're listening to the Swedish House Mafia, but nothing at all about the fact that it's not really house, it's trance, or in what circumstances you might hear such a peculiarly repetitive sound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I miss that idea of a narrative in a musical selection, the idea that the DJ takes you on a journey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is true that I am talking about learning from someone knowledgeable, which means I guess I am talking about programming that is in part educational – and that's a word that makes broadcast executives nervous. It smells of classrooms and chalk, and that wouldn't be popular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But gradually this music-delivery system will begin to acquire the more human characteristics of radio: There are plans for the new CBC service to include program notes, which will presumably give us some insight into the curation process and why we should be listening to what the programmers choose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like every artistic medium's transition to digital delivery, this is a big leap and one that is going to slowly find how to do what it does best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing, though: If one big advantage of streaming is no talky interruptions, then why are there interruptions, in every one of these channels, in the form of annoying promos for the very station you are listening to? Why on earth try to convince people with ads if they are already tuned in?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where do you stand on the new online surveillance bill? Are you with the government? Or are you with the child pornographers? According to Public Safety Minister Vic Toews, you have to choose.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In case you fail to get the point, the new legislation is being subtly marketed as the Protecting Children From Internet Predators Act. Of course, maybe you don't really care about protecting children from Internet predators. Maybe you don't care that without this law, filthy perverts will roam free. Really, it's your choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am scarcely the first person to point out that Stephen Harper's government likes to demonize its opponents, or that it has a nasty authoritarian streak. But in this case, the dissent is unusually widespread. Those with doubts about the bill include opposition politicians, civil libertarians, privacy commissioners and Internet experts – plus more than a few small-c conservatives who wonder why our government insists on whipping up unnecessary moral panic when it doesn't have to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics say the act should really be called the Licence to Snoop Law. That's because the bill would give police the power to acquire detailed information about who you are online, without answering to anyone about why.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But wait! Isn't this the same government that whipped up moral panic over the gun registry and the long-form census? In each case, they told us our right to privacy was threatened by egregious intrusions from the state. The state has no business knowing how many bathrooms you have – but if it wants access to your online activities, hey, that's totally okay. (The fact that Mr. Toews's own privacy was invaded Wednesday on Twitter is an irony I shall leave to others.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This same authoritarian streak is embedded in the government's crime legislation. It's not all bad, but the Conservatives believe a lot of judges are too soft on crime. So they've expanded the use of mandatory minimum sentencing for serious offences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trouble is, circumstances matter. Take the case of Leroy Smickle, a goof with no criminal record who was caught in his cousin's apartment, cavorting with a loaded pistol in front of a webcam. (The cops broke in looking for someone else.) The gun wasn't his, and there was no sign he planned to commit a crime. But the mandatory minimum sentence for possessing a loaded restricted weapon is three years in jail. Did Mr. Smickle deserve it? The judge thought not. She called the mandatory sentence “cruel and unusual punishment” and gave him a year of house arrest instead, which seems about right. Does that make her soft on crime?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wish governments would stick to collecting taxes, managing the economy and trade talks with China. But they never do. Invariably, they try to improve society by imposing their values on us. Conservatives think they can improve society by getting tough on crime and cracking down on drugs. Liberals think they can improve society by enhancing social conditions and easing up on drugs. Conservatives believe in authority and justice. Liberals believe in equality and fairness. Conservatives believe in the police. Liberals believe in human-rights commissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We need both sets of values to maintain a strong society. But both sides feel a need to demonize the other. Each regards the other as fundamentally misguided, probably morally deficient. If you ask me, what we really need is a law that makes it illegal to compare anyone in Parliament to Hitler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why do I stand with the child pornographers here? Because I'm not convinced the police need new powers to root out online child molesters. Judging by the recent highly publicized busts of child-porn rings, their existing powers seem to be working fine. Nor am I convinced that the police will never abuse their power. History shows they usually do. That's why they need civilian oversight. That's not liberal, in my view. That's prudent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marijuana will be legal in Canada one day. It may not be for eons – or at least until the federal Liberals or New Democrats gain power, which could be longer than eons. But it's inevitable.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it's probably not surprising that the biggest push for the legalization and regulation of marijuana is coming from British Columbia, where pot plants are as common as the dandelion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Vancouver, you can smell pot just about anywhere you go. You'll be walking past the downtown Vancouver Art Gallery and suddenly be hit with a familiar odour that puts knowing smirks on the faces of those who encounter it. Most cops turn a blind eye to those blowing a stick. If they'd their druthers, they'd pick a troublemaker high on grass over one who's drunk any day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If those who had gathered downtown for Game 7 of the Stanley Cup final last June had all been stoned and not smashed on alcohol, the riot would never have happened. Hours after the game, baked-out fans would have been sitting on the ground, legs folded, still talking about what a bummer it was the Canucks lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, four former B.C. attorneys-general lent their voices to the campaign to legalize marijuana. They followed in the wake of Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson and three of his predecessors, all of who called for the same thing. Before them, it was an esteemed group of B.C. doctors specializing in drug policy. National associations representing police chiefs, doctors and lawyers have also called for the decriminalization of marijuana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no shortage of people with deep and distinct knowledge of this issue who've witnessed the unmitigated failure of our drug laws and called for a change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, there're probably many people across Canada, especially in provinces such as Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, who don't understand the preoccupation that many people living in Vancouver have with this issue. In some quarters, I'm sure, it's dismissed as the whimsical obsession of those in Lotusland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, the same ones living amid a gang war that's arrived, in some cases, at their front door. Fact is, there isn't a jurisdiction in the country that can relate to the type of gang violence the drug trade generates on the West Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government believes the answer is to get tougher on criminals. So at the same time as the chorus of those calling for the legalization and regulation of marijuana rises, the Conservatives are proposing we go in precisely the opposite direction, with harsher sentences for drug offences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That will do nothing to end the violence on the streets of Vancouver and only clog up an already overburdened court system with people who shouldn't be there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, it's easy to say legalize without considering the public policy ramifications. That's effectively what the federal Liberals did at their last convention. It's fine for four former attorneys-general to demand that we begin regulating the sale of marijuana without clearly setting out how it might work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also the not-so-small question of the impact it would have on Canada-U.S. relations and the many practical considerations that flow from it. It doesn't take a wild imagination to conjure up the image of border custom agents spending 15 minutes per car as their dogs sniff for Canadian weed. Is that a price we'd be prepared to pay?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How would you regulate the production and sale of marijuana? Would it be sold commercially? What would be the age limit for consumption? What, if anything, could be done to prevent Canada from becoming a marijuana black market for the U.S.?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although polls suggest Canadians support the idea of legalizing marijuana in general, they'll want to see a detailed plan before backing the idea unreservedly. That's where the work needs to be done now by drug reform proponents. There's plenty of time to do it – the Conservatives will be in power for a while yet.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seniors will hate this idea, but let's increase the clawback on Old Age Security benefits.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We can help sustain OAS for the long term that way, and we do it in a way that doesn't favour today's retirees over the people with decades to go until they leave the work force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concerned about the rising costs associated with an aging population, the federal government has been looking at ways to trim OAS benefits. The idea generating the most talk is to set a future date at which the minimum OAS age would start climbing to 67 from 65.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a nice solution for Ottawa because it won't provoke current retirees. Angry seniors can be a handful for a government, as Brian Mulroney found when, in 1985, he tried to stop fully indexing OAS benefits to inflation. A 63-year-old Quebec woman named Solange Denis gave the prime minister a talking-to in a confrontation that was caught on camera. In the end, the government backed down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increasing the reach of the OAS clawback would invite the anger of scores of financially comfortable seniors. Even Susan Eng, vice-president of advocacy at the senior's group CARP, acknowledges how sensitive seniors are about this issue. “They grouse about the clawback for sure.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OAS is designed to provide a small base amount of retirement savings – $540 per month at most – to all Canadians who meet certain residency requirements. The program is targeted at low- and middle-income seniors, which explains the clawback for people with higher incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 2012, the clawback starts taking effect when taxable income, including pensions, investments, rental income and business income, exceeds $69,562. The clawback is equivalent to 15 per cent of the excess amount. With income getting into six figures, OAS disappears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No question, we're dealing with comparatively well off people when we consider the clawback. According to Statistics Canada numbers, the average married elderly couple had a household income of just over $60,000. The clawback, just to remind you, doesn't even kick in until an individual makes close to $70,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Eng said opposition to the clawback has little to do with income level. “It's more the principle of the thing,” she said. “It's a function of this being a piece of the social safety net that they paid for all their many years, and they should just be able to get at it without all these hoops.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How many are making enough money to experience the clawback? “Many, many are not,” Ms. Eng said. “They're nowhere close.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government could either increase the percentage amount of OAS benefits that are clawed back by a modest amount, or it could apply the current clawback rate at a somewhat lower income level. Another option is to de-index the annual income level at which the clawback applies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a messier approach than raising the minimum OAS age to 67, but it's also a fairer approach in a generational sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key question here is why today's younger Canadians – the seniors of tomorrow – must settle for OAS at 67 so current seniors can get it at 65. OAS is not a pension, like the Canada Pension Plan, where you pay premiums in your working years that essentially buy you a certain level of income. OAS is paid on an as-we-go basis out of general government tax revenue, which means people in the work force pay a big part of the OAS benefits that retirees receive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frankly, retirement at 67 or even later makes good sense in that it reflects today's longer lifespans and low levels of retirement savings. But, again, there's a generational angle to be considered. Seniors would be staying on the job longer, and that could mean fewer opportunities for young workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of this is likely to placate the seniors in the clawback zone, but they're at least financially comfortable. “For the average senior, $69,000 is pretty good when you talk about retirement income ideally being 60 per cent of what you used to make before you retired,” said Cleo Hamel, <span class="companylink">H&amp;R Block</span>'s senior tax analyst. “You can live pretty comfortably for that in most parts of the country.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the way, Ms. Hamel's dad had his OAS benefits clawed back one year after selling a recent property. “He was not very happy,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking ahead a few years, two big themes that will guide federal government spending are austerity and an aging population. Lots of us will be giving up something to help make the numbers work and there's no reason today's well-off seniors can't join us.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE OAS CLAWBACK</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-income earners above the age of 65 may get all or a portion of their OAS clawed back if their annual income exceeds certain levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For calendar 2012, the clawback begins once income reaches $69,562.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OAS is clawed back at a rate of 15 per cent on income above the threshold noted above.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your total OAS received is indexed and calculated quarterly. Therefore, maximum to be received in 2012 is not yet known.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 2011, maximum OAS received was $6,368.25 and OAS will be clawed back starting at $67,668 of income; therefore, OAS will be fully clawed back at an income level of $110,123.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Example: If a senior has income of $72,500 in 2012, the repayment amount will be $440.70 (15 per cent of the excess between $72,500 and $69,562).</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where's Robert Redford when we need him?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 35 years ago, after the Sundance Kid did a star turn in All the President's Men, a generation of kids rushed into journalism schools around North America hoping to become the next Bob Woodward. Journalism hit its zenith of cool, seen as an endeavour that could not only bring down a president but also receive the Hollywood treatment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now? With all due respect to my hard-working colleagues, we are not cool. Worse, we desperately wish we were.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least that's the thesis of Richard Tofel, a former Wall Street Journal editor who is now the general manager of the not-for-profit investigative outfit ProPublica.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Tofel published Why American Newspapers Gave Away the Future, an e-book (initially available, yes, for free, but now priced at $1.99) in which he tries to understand how the industry fell into the toilet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He places the blame largely on the handful of families who dominated the U.S. newspaper business for more than a century. At first, he says, the stewardship of those clans – the Ochses and Sulzbergers (The New York Times), the Otises and Chandlers (Los Angeles Times), the Hearsts and Pulitzers and Knights and Ridders – helped to keep their companies insulated from outside pressures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the third and fourth generations ascended to their thrones by birthright rather than hard work, Tofel argues, some were perhaps less equipped than their predecessors. They fell under the sway of outside consultants pitching ephemeral trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were insecure, uncool, and they knew it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, along came Silicon Valley, with its innovator-as-hero mythos, its rebel streak and its mantra that “information wants to be free.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newspaper biz became like the high-school nerd who was only too eager to help the quarterback cheat on math tests, as long as they could hang out together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we gave away the product of our hard work, because the cool kids insisted that was the cool thing to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Striving for a bit of borrowed cool himself, Tofel quotes Normal Mailer's essay The White Negro, which argues that “one is Hip or one is Square … one is a rebel or one conforms.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newspapers may once have been rebels, but that's not the way people think of us. They prefer their rebels to be like Julian Assange, who, when he first came to mainstream attention with the release of the Afghan War Logs in July, 2010, was treated to articles like one in this paper, which carried the quivering headline “Weirdly alluring, WikiLeaks's founder brings sexy back to whistle-blowing.” (This was before he was accused of rape, which of course made him uncool.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, though, legacy news organizations have decided that they don't care about being uncool. Newspapers including The New York Times and the Financial Times have had some success with metering systems – the outside world calls them paywalls – to earn circulation revenue. (This summer, The Globe and Mail will follow suit with its own premium package.) Incidentally, not caring about being cool or uncool – that is, being yourself – is the first step to being cool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And on Tuesday, The Associated Press filed suit in New York against the Meltwater Group, a 10-year-old company founded in Norway that offers an online press-clipping service for about 20,000 clients. AP says the “parasitic” Meltwater steals its news stories; Meltwater says the newswire is misinformed about its service, which it likened to <span class="companylink">Google</span> News.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its suit, AP offered four examples of its deep investment in reporting, including the fact that it is the only Western news organization with a full bureau in North Korea. “The creative work that operators like Meltwater appropriate for free and exploit to their benefit is expensive, substantial and highly skilled, and could not be sustained without appropriate compensation to those who create it,” the filing reads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there was another example, which seemed like something out of another era. “When Aretha Franklin wanted to announce she was getting engaged, she called just one reporter: AP music writer Nekesa Mumbi Moody, who has cultivated a long relationship with Franklin.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That boast came even as people were still talking about the fact that the news of Whitney Houston's death on Saturday emerged from a tweet by the niece of Houston's hairstylist. By one measure, it made the AP seem kind of stuck behind the times, kind of uncool. But the AP was the first to verify the news, to report the truth, because that is its raison d'etre. Which is kind of cool.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VANCOUVER -- “I am going to leave the marijuana debate to the federal government. It's in their sole sphere of responsibility,” B.C. Premier Christy Clark told reporters after former attorneys-general call for legalization of marijuana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chorus of voices calling for a change in the marijuana laws is growing louder in B.C. as the federal government moves in the opposite direction, advocating mandatory minimum sentences.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four former attorneys-general added their names this week to a growing list of people asking the provincial government to urge Ottawa to regulate and tax marijuana use and to abandon the mandatory minimum sentences for minor and non-violent marijuana-related offences. Others on the list include four former Vancouver mayors, the current Vancouver mayor, medical health officers across the province, several police officers and health-related academics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Christy Clark declined to comment. On previous occasions, however, she has not shied away from entering the debate over matters solely within federal jurisdiction. She has even spoken out about the tough-on-crime bill that includes the new marijuana penalties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last November, Ms. Clark offered support for parts of the federal crime bill during Question Period in the provincial legislature. NDP Leader Adrian Dix asked whether she agreed that Ottawa – not B.C. – should pay the increased costs for prisons that will result from tougher sentencing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After expressing some concern about how B.C. will manage the costs, Ms. Clark spoke at length about parts of the bill that she felt would be popular. She referred to tougher sentences for child molesters and violent young offenders, and ending house arrest for serious crimes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Those are all things that British Columbians are behind and they're all things that people on this side of the House are also 100-per-cent behind,” Ms. Clark said. She did not mention tougher penalties for marijuana possession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked four more times by Mr. Dix and NDP justice critic Kathy Corrigan about paying the costs, she repeatedly talked about the substance of the bill, without indicating any hesitation about commenting on an area solely within federal jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I support making sure that our children are safe from sex offenders, and I support the elements of this bill that will mean that Canada and British Columbia are safer places because we have laws that will protect us,” Ms. Clark said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norman Ruff, an emeritus professor of political science at the University of Victoria, said Ms. Clark's response to the concerns of the attorneys-general about marijuana laws reflected provincial politics as much as her new-found respect for the division of responsibilities between federal and provincial governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Clark has not shrunk from involving herself in debates over federal issues that affect the province, Prof. Ruff said in an interview. But whenever she has spoken out, she has always made it clear that she was onside with Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government agenda on crime, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her primary purpose in staking out a position has been to retain political support that could otherwise drift to B.C. Conservative Leader John Cummins. “She is trying to head off the [B.C.] Conservatives by appearing to be tough on crime,” Prof. Ruff said. “She is leaning to the right, going into the next election.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By trying to deflect a question on where she stands, it looks like Ms. Clark does not see any political advantage at this time in declaring her position on the legalization of marijuana. Similar to other politicians, she may be waiting until she is no longer in office to speak frankly about the controversial weed.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don Drummond, the chair of the Commission on the Reform of Ontario's Public Services, is certainly not going to become the premier in a government of technocrats in Canada's most populous province – such as Mario Monti's in Italy or Lukas Papademos's in Greece – but the commission's report is an admirable exercise in technocratic, rationalistic policy-making, which may well be invoked for years to come by policy wonks across Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Drummond and his colleagues are right to set the bar high – within the mandate set by the provincial government – rather than second-guess what Dalton McGuinty, the Premier, will actually accept or act upon, particularly in a minority government. Consequently, the upshot is likely to be that the provincial government will indeed put some of the Drummond report's recommendations into effect, but will not return to fiscal balance in 2017-2018 as planned.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report ranges from extraordinarily sweeping statements to quite detailed ones. The commissioners rightly say, for example, that Ontario does not have a health-care system, but rather “a series of disjointed services working in many different silos,” though a little later they say that Ontario's health care is one of the best in Canada. The clear implication is that the so-called system should become truly systematic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A much more specific proposal is that the province's drug benefit program for seniors should more directly correspond to income – what some would call a “means test” – and not simply on age; British Columbia's change from an age-dependent program to a purely income-based one is cautiously found “worthy of study.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And though the Drummond report repeats the perennially vague call for a greater emphasis on disease prevention, it also goes so far as to tell physicians to be less ready to prescribe Lipitor for cholesterol and more zealous in urging better diet and more exercise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Physicians are singled out on the broader public-sector compensation front. On the one hand, the report expresses respect for collective bargaining, and says that drastic, across-the-board wage freezes are all too apt to be reversed a few years later, with generous catch-up pay raises. On the other hand, it advises the government to “aggressively negotiate” with the doctors – for no increase in their total compensation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is nothing about aggressiveness in the passages about labour-relations issues. Rather, it urges more objectivity, more study of the government's – and the taxpayers' – ability to pay, more evidence-based decisions in arbitrations – and proposes taking away the choice of the arbitrators from the parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prevailing theme of the Drummond report could be stated as “Let's all be rational from now on.” It is solid technocratic work, though it is by no means advocating a government of technocrats as in Italy or Greece. Yet Mr. Drummond enjoys pointing out that Greece's public finances were as sound as Ontario's back in 1984. The main message is that the right things can be done – and that eventually things could get much worse, if not attended to now.</p>

Prohibition didn't deter drinking and was a boon to organized crime. Sounds very much like the war on marijuana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Attorneys-general occupy a privileged dual position – leaders in partisan politics while also being responsible for giving objective legal advice, and protecting the integrity of the legal system. If Geoff Plant, Graeme Bowbrick, Ujjal Dosanjh (also a B.C. premier) and Colin Gabelmann, who collectively prosecuted marijuana users for 15 years, don't perceive a benefit, is there a benefit?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are fully aware that British Columbia lost its war against the marijuana industry many years ago,” they said in an open letter to Premier Christy Clark. It would have been better, of course, to have spoken out when they were in power. Still, with the federal government creating a mandatory-minimum sentence of six months in jail for anyone who grows five marijuana plants or more, their letter is timely. “These misguided prosecutions will further strain an already clogged system, without reducing cannabis prohibition-related violence or rates of cannabis use.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether legalization (or “taxation and regulation,” as they call it) or decriminalization or some other approach is the best option, it is clear that the old model for combatting marijuana use is irrevocably broken. Why is Canada stuck on it?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce Smillie looked out on a deserted newsroom. The reporting staff had vanished. His crew was chasing untold stories in the naked city, or, more likely, sampling some of the sinful temptations available in Vancouver on a Friday evening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At last, he spotted a waif half-hidden behind a pillar – a long-haired, teenaged cub reporter in torn jeans and sneakers whose voice had yet to crack and who did not shave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a calm but authoritative voice, Mr. Smillie, the night city editor of the Vancouver Sun, the largest and finest newspaper in Western Canada, filled me in on sketchy details gleaned from eavesdropping on the police.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Go with a photographer, he ordered. He'll drive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good thing, I thought. I don't have a driver's licence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newsroom reeked of cigarette smoke and spilled booze in the final year of that blighted decade, the 1970s. The dingy linoleum showed black pockmarks from the stubs of lit cigarettes tossed carelessly on deadline. When pulled open, desk drawers rattled with a symphony of empty glass bottles of booze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To fill out the roster, they'd hired a 19-year-old soon-to-be-dropout with a thin résumé of student newspaper clippings. I handled weekend evening grunt duties – library research, police checks. (“Duty officer, please. Anything to report tonight in Ioco? Squamish? White Rock?”) It wasn't Woodward and Bernstein, but it was all right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overseeing the evening action was Mr. Smillie, whose duties included assigning stories. The son of a Comox postmaster, he got his start as a circulation clerk in the paper's New Westminster office, later becoming a reporter in the bureau there. He had big, workingman's hands, a laurel wreath of greying hair, and, unlike so many others in the business, never raised his voice in anger. He had seven children at home, overseen by his wife, Martha. Those were a lot of mouths to feed, so during the long strike he worked on the waterfront, a job he held onto after the dispute settled to make up for a shortfall in the family's income. By day, he was a longshoreman responsible for stacking 50-kilogram sacks of flour in the hold of a cargo ship. By evening, he was at his desk, a lamp nearby to compensate for the newsroom's dismal, yellowish lighting. He was a real-life Lou Grant and his staff loved him. They called him Mr. Nightside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Scott, a wild-eyed photographer who had been at the Sun since before I was born, raced to a nightclub in suburban Richmond, screeching to a halt in the parking lot. I leapt out of the passenger side, notepad in left hand, pen in right, running toward the entrance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The door opened and a large, square-shouldered man emerged. Startled by my approach, he raised his right hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the slow-motion memory one has of a car wreck, I stared down the barrel of a revolver. I put both heels forward like Wile E. Coyote trying to stop going over a cliff only to get bumped from behind. Mr. Scott tried to get a photograph and, dammit, the kid reporter was in the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turned out the man in the doorway was a plainclothes Mountie. The scene inside, a gangland hit, was unpleasant. The police were jittery. In the newsroom, Mr. Smillie called the duty officer, who apologized. Mr. Nightside dispatched me to the press club. Just another day at the office for him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nightside retired from the newsroom in 1994, a revered figure in a workplace not known for its harmony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is 82 now, patriarch of a fecund clan – his seven children have produced 32 grandchildren.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked his philosophy of running the newsroom, he said: “It was simple. If you treat people decently, they're going to respond in turn.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A generation of young reporters thrived under his benevolent hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the weekend, the Sun celebrated the 100th anniversary of its first edition, producing two handsome, well-written sections on its history. The kindly Mr. Nightside was overshadowed, which is how these things work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Happy centennial, Vancouver Sun. Many happy returns, Mr. Nightside.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Question</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm in a bit of a parenting pickle. I am the dad of a five-year-old boy and I need a modern voice like yours to give me advice on educating my son on the finer points of girls. When I grew up in the seventies my dad was awesome. We had loads of father-son time and he was always cool about saying, “Hey, do you think she's cute?” or encouraging me to engage with girls and not be scared. Nothing crass, sexist or over the top, just pointing me in the general direction. I grew up to be a kind, compassionate guy with a healthy attitude about women and sex. My problem is these days everyone is so concerned about being politically correct. How do I go about doing what my dad did in a way that's not going to get anyone's nose out of joint? I'm not suggesting my son get himself a girlfriend and they shack up or anything like that. I just want my boy to have half a clue as he gets older.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think you may be overthinking the whole business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And pardon me, but your POV strikes me as a little “off” here and there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I mean, a five-year-old “shacking up” with his “girlfriend”? What dusty back room of your cranial cavity does that notion even come from?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What I think you should do about the whole non-issue of schooling your kindergartener on the Tao of chatting up chicks is: nada, zip, goose egg, bupkes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, as any sensible parenting expert will tell you: “Children learn with their eyes, not their ears.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meaning, it mostly doesn't matter what kind of instructional quacking emanates from your lecturing lips. (The old Peanuts cartoons captured this best: Every time adults spoke, all the kids heard was, “Wah wah-wah wah wah wah-wah.”) Mostly, the way children decide how to comport themselves is to observe your behaviour and model themselves after it – or not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So if you are indeed, a “kind, compassionate guy with a healthy attitude toward women and sex,” your son will, let us hope, follow in your sensitive-guy, tiptoe-through-the-tulips-type footsteps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then you can maybe follow up with some instructional banter on how to chat up chicks – in about five to seven years. I'm glad you had such an awesome and oh-so-seventies dad, teaching you to how to mack the honeys before you were out of training wheels, but in 2012 that might come off as kind of creepy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your son doesn't need to think of girls as objects of romantic interest at age 5! Right now, if the development of my own three boys is any indication, he regards “women” as playmates who are much like him (except perhaps without the interest in construction machinery), but who don't always invite him to their birthday parties.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, why create problems where none exist? What is truly “modern” about your question, I think, is it's textbook overinvolved, overthinking “helicopter parenting,” i.e. hovering over your kids, trying to anticipate their every need.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let the boy be free to explore and find out things on his own. I was home with my kids when they were little, and I tell people: “My kids were raised in an atmosphere of benign neglect, and I only say ‘benign' to make it sound good.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, although their mother and I sometimes fight (and we've had real doozies: she threw me out of the car on the highway once – I had to call a cab to the middle of freakin' nowhere), they can see that we mostly conduct our relationship in an atmosphere of mutual respect, forbearance and love.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario faces two huge challenges – economic and fiscal.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province has already slid below the average of the rest of Canada in output and income per capita. Beyond the next few years of recovery, Ontario can look forward to only modest annual growth of around 2 per cent, well below historical norms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This reality frames the fiscal problem. The province can't simply adjust its fiscal parameters for a few years to eliminate a deficit caused by the recession and associated stimulus. Even with the restraint measures already taken, the deficit would continue to rise in an environment of modest economic growth. The fiscal response must not only be strong and sustained, it must reform the way the government delivers virtually every service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last March's provincial budget established the Commission on the Reform of Ontario's Public Services to advise the government on how to return to a balanced budget no later than 2017-18 and how to get more value for taxpayers' money. Early in its work, the commission concluded that the deficit, $14-billion in 2010-11, was on track to rise to just over $30-billion by then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue growth at existing tax rates would be insufficient to cover program spending, where existing cost pressures would drive spending much higher. “Existing” is the operative word here; our mandate precluded us from recommending tax increases, so we focused on changing the existing trajectory for spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without vigorous fiscal action, the government's debt-to-GDP ratio would rise from last year's 35 per cent to more than 50 per cent. The danger is obvious. High-debt governments are vulnerable to market demands, forced eventually to take draconian measures to keep lenders happy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian governments got out of similar fiscal holes in the 1990s. But they had strong economic growth to lend a helping hand; that, and a period of spending restraint brought them back to balance in relatively short order. Ontario even managed this feat while cutting taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once budgets were balanced, however, spending took off again, partly because it could (revenue growth remained strong) and partly because governments had missed an opportunity for thorough reform. This was particularly evident in health care, where the brakes were slammed on previous rapid spending growth, but reforms were partial. After a few years of restraint and growing perceptions that quality of care had slipped, all jurisdictions simply turned on the taps again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we have to keep in mind two things. First, economic growth will not be a huge help this time around. Everything must be done to bolster the economy, but we can't count on the type of growth to which Ontario has been so accustomed. Second, the government must focus on reform, not on simple cost cutting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordability and excellence of public services are not incompatible; they can be reconciled by delivering all programs more efficiently, which serves both the fiscal imperative and Ontarians' desire for better-run programs. The health system's silos can be better integrated to save money and ensure people don't fall between the cracks. Universities and colleges could deliver better value for the money through greater differentiation and reducing their high, internal rates of cost escalation. Impressive results have been achieved in recent years in Ontario's education system, but non-core costs have risen sharply and must be reined in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inefficiencies and confusion are sown in many areas by overlapping responsibilities among the three levels of government. In all cases, great efficiency requires clear plans and objectives, continuous analysis of performance and a firm determination to reform or scrap underachievers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commission is recommending a degree of spending restraint that is almost certainly unprecedented in Canadian postwar history – annual growth in program spending of only 0.8 per cent over a seven-year period. We would limit health to increases of 2.5 per cent a year, postsecondary education to 1.5 per cent, education to 1 per cent and social services to 0.5 per cent; everything else would contract by 2.4 per cent a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are no easy escape routes from this course of action. A one-year delay in the target date for budget balance would permit spending growth of 1 per cent annually. We already incorporate higher annual revenues from tax compliance and other measures not requiring tax rate hikes. Even higher taxes would offer little relief. Debate over eliminating the last scheduled corporate income tax cut largely misses the point; such a step would reduce the $30-billion deficit in 2017-18 by only $800-million. To allow 2-per-cent annual spending growth, for example, would require a three-percentage point increase in the HST to 16 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost all of the commission's nearly 400 recommendations could and should be implemented regardless of the fiscal situation, simply because they offer Ontarians better value. Our report is replete with examples of potential efficiency gains in everything the government does.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few, if any, governments have succeeded at this in the past; few have even tried. But throwing money at problems is no longer an option. Things must be done differently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We think the Ontario government can deliver the best public services in the world at a cost Ontario taxpayers can afford. It will not be easy, but we think this is feasible. And we ask: Why not?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The temptation to put a casino in Toronto is growing. The provincial government, facing a towering budget deficit, is tempted by the millions it would draw from a big gambling attraction in the country's largest city. The city government, with budget problems of its own, is enticed by the thought of extra money for transit and other needs.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finance Minister Dwight Duncan has signalled the province might be open to the idea. So has Doug Ford, brother of Mayor Rob Ford. Deputy mayor Doug Holyday raised the notion this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario Place is shutting down and looking for a new purpose. Putting a casino there is one of the ideas on the table. Don Drummond's report on Ontario's finances recommends closing one of the casinos in Niagara. That might leave the door open wider to a Toronto gambling palace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City councillors are already preparing for a fight on the issue. Downtown Councillor Adam Vaughan, of Ward 20, Trinity-Spadina, fired the first shot when he made a move on Tuesday to explicitly prohibit casinos in Toronto through zoning bylaws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That irked a group of Scarborough councillors, who thought he was getting ahead of himself. They fired back, passing their own resolution to keep the door open to casinos. Toronto, they say, should at least consider the economic benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vaughan is in the right on this one. Toronto is blessed by the absence of a casino. You can bet on horseflesh or pull the slots at Woodbine, but for the full casino experience you must travel to Windsor or Niagara or <span class="companylink">Casino Rama</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Putting a gaudy gambling venue at Ontario Place would be the worst way to transform that choice waterfront location. Replacing a water park with roulette tables hardly classes up the place. Surely we can be more creative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If people thought Doug Ford's idea of putting a Ferris wheel at the Port Lands was tacky, why would the city even consider a casino on the other side of the waterfront? No wonder a recent poll showed 50 per cent of Torontonians are against building a casino here, while 35 per cent are in favour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would a casino pull in more tourists? Certainly. It would also attract more local gamblers, who would spend their money on gaming instead of in Toronto cinemas, restaurants or theatres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the whole issue of problem gambling. The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health says 4.8 per cent of Ontario adults, or 449,000 people, have moderate or severe gambling problems. Another 860,000 people are considered “at risk” for problem gambling. Nearly 5 per cent of students engage in heavy gambling. CAMH says that, according to U.S. studies, one person in five with gambling problems will file for bankruptcy at some point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least now, problem gamblers in Toronto have to travel to get the casino experience. Imagine how much more tempted they would be if they had a full casino right at home, reachable by a cab or transit ride.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governments are addicted to the easy money from gambling. Instead of raising taxes and taking the heat, they can simply open a casino and watch the money pour in. Revenue from government-run gambling rose to $13.7-billion in 2009 from $2.7-billion in 1992, Statistics Canada says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To assuage their guilt, governments set up programs to treat the very problem gamblers whose habit is enabled by government-sanctioned gambling. CAMH says that only a small proportion of problem gamblers ever use these programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It almost makes you hanker for the days when gambling was considered a vice, condemned from the pulpit and banned or limited by law. Today, governments happily promote it. Television ads urge us to buy that lottery ticket and win a fortune. Nothing is said about the torn families and ruined lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is any trace remaining of old Toronto the Good, the city will close its gates to casino gambling.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty-two Ontario children were rescued from child pornography this month, and we should stand with them. The police bust was possible only because warrants were built from Internet protocol addresses selected from 60 of 9,000 computers in Southern Ontario that had received and sent child porn in the previous 60 days.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obtaining warrants on all addresses simply wasn't practical. “It's still like putting a cup under Niagara Falls, that's all we're catching,” said Inspector Scott Naylor, manager of the Ontario Provincial Police's child sexual exploitation section. More than 200 charges were laid against 60 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifteen of the 22 child victims are receiving care through Boost Child Abuse Prevention &amp; Intervention, where executive director Karyn Kennedy wants us to drop the “child pornography” phrase. “It's child sexual abuse that's happening on the Internet, in real time, and people are sitting and watching this happen,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So how did protecting children from sexual crimes online get transformed into a debate on privacy in the House of Commons this week?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think it has something to do with a lack of humility on all sides and playing politics with one of our bedrock values: care for the vulnerable. In the sheer speed and acrimony of public posturing, the Conservative government gave Bill C-30, the Protecting Children from Internet Predators Act, a hot button title and mocked any who doubted it, while opposition parties criticized “with us or against us” rhetoric that they said ignored legitimate concerns. The debate that played out this week was a sideshow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think of it like this: With this kind of cyber crime, surfing the Internet is akin to driving your car. The car is your private property and you know how to use it, but some people keep making the road dangerous. You appreciate the radar gun or spot checks at the side of the road, and you take down a licence-plate number when a driver needs to be reported. It's a public service that keeps us safe. That's how police see access to your IP address – it will help them to identify lawbreakers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The metaphor fits for why Bill C-30 is applauded by those on the front lines of child protection. Like using a radar gun, hackers employed by the police have developed software that catches images of child sexual exploitation. It's illegal images that are being tracked. Police will take that digital evidence to ask who's trading this, and that leads to an IP address – the licence plate of your car, if you will. For the public good, because child exploitation is expanding its reach through technology, those IP addresses need to be available when required.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But how, when and why they do is what created outrage this week, and we saw just how difficult public trust is to navigate. If we don't get this right, more children will be violated. The accountability demanded of the government is a good thing. Paul Gillespie, the former Ontario police officer who pioneered policing child porn with <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> founder Bill Gates, struck a hopeful tone: This gives us a chance to elevate the debate to find answers for protecting children, he told the CBC, and isn't that what everyone would want?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this blessed province of milk and mead, the care and nurturing of seniors are given exceedingly short shrift.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, the promised appointment of a seniors' advocate is a good thing.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In B.C., while the population of those over 65 went up nearly 20 per cent between 2002 and 2008, the number receiving home care increased by a paltry 4 per cent. Later figures, albeit incomplete, show the gap is widening even more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is this government so penny-wise and loonie-foolish? Almost certainly because money spent now is tangible and savings down the road are not. The obsessive mantra of low taxes and balanced budgets is good on the hustings but a straitjacket for sound social policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It doesn't have to be that way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Denmark, land of the Great Dane and Jannik Hansen, there is free, publicly funded home care for all seniors who need it. Annual home-care assessments are mandatory for everyone over 75.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An amount equivalent to 1.8 per cent of the country's GDP is spent on nonmedical care for seniors, a figure so far in excess of what B.C. spends that it's hard to measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result? A mere 20 per cent of the funds spent on elderly Danes goes to institutional care. Here, the figure is 80 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the woes facing our seniors, so short-changed by government services, the grim musing of one expert at a conference on aging, as she approaches 65, is understandable: “I don't know whether to slit my throat, or move to Denmark.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slow down</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am confused why a confident, happy person would be so needy as to want someone to fight for them before they even really know each other. You don't date someone to see if they will fight for you. You date to see if your attraction sticks, to see if you are compatible, and to see if you fall in love. Dating is not a waiting game; it is a treasure hunt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– Brian King, Ladysmith, B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Change your thinking</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stop thinking, “But I want that little something extra.” Partners are not hood ornaments, candy cherries or baubles. You should see them as the other (possibly) half of your life. Marriage is work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– Justin Ball, New Westminster, B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Try making friends</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You are young, confident and happy. If you don't feel a need to be in a relationship, you don't have to! But you can always talk yourself into making more friends and opening up more avenues for yourself. The “friends” made can be pretty handy when you need them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– Agnes Tai, Edmonton</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final word</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I asked my eldest daughter about this idea of men duelling it out for women. Where does it come from? She rolled her eyes and dubbed it the Bella Effect – girls fantasizing about being the heroine from Twilight, who has not one hot guy fighting for her, but two. Only, here's the thing: In Twilight, Edward is a vampire and Jacob is a werewolf – creatures that do not really exist. Despite the women's movement, when it comes to finding a romantic partner, young women often turn into passive, simpering twits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should you take a chance on the current potential? I don't know, is he a serial killer? Does he eat babies for breakfast? The only way to find out is to let to know him. Have a list of important qualities you're looking for and see if he fits the bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You want that “little something extra,” but Justin's right, finding a future spouse is not in the same category as ordering extra croutons on your salad. Here's what I tell my daughters: Strategize about finding a life partner the same way you'd strategize about finding the right career. Both are important to a woman's future happiness, so why be pro-active with one and lie around like a beached, romantically sick whale with the other?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agnes's sentiment about making friends could work for you. My sister-in-law spied a handsome fellow counsellor while volunteering at Muslim camp. After getting to know him and learning that he had the qualities she valued - she proposed. She's now happily married with four kids. In the 21st century, self-respecting, modern women can make the first move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So get cracking. You don't want to wake up one morning and wonder where all the good men have gone. Possible answer: They're married to women who were willing to fight for themselves.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as Canada's community colleges set out to recruit large numbers of foreign students, they have chosen to preserve their quotas on the number of foreign athletes who can make their varsity sports teams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question in this archetypal Canadian conflict is whether such protectionism helps or hurts this country's athletes. In the short term, it helps an athlete make a team. But aren't teams better off when drawing from wider, more diverse talent pools? And then the players who make those teams are better off. Excellence is reinforced by openness; a more closed system reinforces mediocrity.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It speaks volumes that tiny Holland College in Prince Edward Island (2,600 students, 4 per cent of them foreign) is standing up against the long-standing quota system in which 10 of 12 players on volleyball and basketball teams must be Canadian, and 15 of 18 in soccer. Within eight years, the school says, the population of high-school graduates in Atlantic Canada will drop by 30 per cent. Postsecondary schools need international students if they wish to survive, it says. The small cannot afford protectionism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian postsecondary schools are becoming increasingly international in their professoriate, their student bodies and in the experiences they offer their students. The schools profess that the quality of education increases with competition, diversity and new ideas. It is hard to square that stated belief with the quotas limiting foreign athletes who may have different athletic instincts, styles of play, and training methods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's doubtful that the community colleges would be swamped by foreign athletes. University athletes in Canadian Interuniversity Sport, a higher level of competition, do not face such quotas (except in basketball), and the athletic floodgates have not opened. The National Collegiate Athletic Association has no caps on international students. But the Canadian Collegiate AthleticAssociation won't budge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition is good, especially in sports. Athletes in community colleges don't need the coddling. Quotas on foreign athletes limit the growth of all athletes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The intensifying debate over whether a golfer should be allowed to use a belly putter appears to be settling on one crucial factor: It's not the length of a putter that matters, but of anchoring it against one's body. Does this confer an advantage, and if so, should the rules not allow a golfer to adopt the style?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also another pertinent question: Does anchoring a putter against one's body have a legitimate place in a game that is supposed to compel a player to cope with anxiety, not to all but eliminate it artificially? Anchoring a putter against one's body enables a single-lever stroke; only one arm swings. Hand action, and hence inconsistency, is reduced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be wrong to say for certain that the anchored stroke – call it the belly putter because that's how everybody refers to the issue – should be banished. After all, it's easier on the back because the golfer can stand up straighter. Maybe the belly putter represents progress. Maybe research will show that it confers no real advantages. Studies need to be done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The way David Hearn of Brantford, Ont., finished his opening round of the Northern Trust Open at the Riviera Country Club near Los Angeles on Thursday demonstrates the vexing problem facing golf's ruling bodies. Hearn was three-under par in windy conditions with two holes, the eighth and ninth on the course, to play. Hearn uses a belly putter. He holed a 25-foot par putt on the eighth to remain at three under.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hearn ran into trouble on his last hole, and had a 15-foot putt to finish with a bogey. But he ran that three feet by; clearly, he hit the putt too firmly. He made the three-footer to close with a double bogey and shoot 70, still a good score on a day when conditions were difficult. He finished by making a long putt with an anchored stroke on one hole, and then missed a shorter putt on the next hole with the same style.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hearn, 32, has been using a belly putter with a good deal of success. He's discussed the matter of the putter's value with his father Geoffrey, who once believed the authorities should ban it. He changed his mind – and not only because his son is benefiting from the so-called “broomstick” putter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“David says, and he is right, that long or short, the player has to put in the work,” his father wrote in a recent lengthy, thoughtful e-mail. “He went on to state that some players are suited to short putters and some to long. This year the first five [PGA Tour] events have been won with short putters.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phil Mickelson won the <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span> Pebble Beach National Pro-Am last Sunday using a short putter, so that makes it six in a row for the conventional style. Mickelson, 41, has flirted with the belly putter. He said after his win that he feels fantastic now with the regular putter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Tiger Woods said last week that he's a traditionalist, and that he believes a golfer shouldn't be allowed to use a putter that's longer than the shortest club in his bag. That's one way to ban anchoring. But why not simply ban anchoring and not deal with a putter's length?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Davis, the United States Golf Association's progressive executive director, said during the organization's recent annual meeting in Houston that it will take a “fresh look” at the subject. Glen Nager, the USGA's new president, said this week that studies about the belly putter's effect are needed. Davis and Nager are concerned more about the putter being anchored than its length.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keegan Bradley was 25 when he won the PGA Championship last summer with a belly putter. Fellow twentysomething Webb Simpson is an anchor man. Adam Scott, 31, uses an even longer putter. They're not exactly golfers who have aged into anxiety on the greens. They simply believe it's a more effective way to putt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Older golfers are also using the belly putter. Ernie Els has turned to it out of desperation. He said this week that he'd like to see it banned, even if he's using it. Mike Weir has turned to anchoring. Els and Weir are in their 40s. Meanwhile, the anchored stroke is all over the Champions Tour. Some pundits believe anybody who uses an anchor stroke is cheating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not cheating based on the rules, but it is controversial because it hits directly at the central matter of the problem of anxiety in golf. Golf's ruling bodies need to key on that issue, and the proliferation of the belly putter is forcing them to do that. This promises to be quite a fight, with no sure route to finding the sweet spot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THEY SAID IT / THE LONG AND SHORT OF BELLY PUTTER DEBATE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm a traditionalist when it comes to that. My idea was to have it so that the putter would be equal to or less than the shortest club in your bag and I think, with that, we'd be able to get away from any type of belly anchoring."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tiger Woods</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I just think that to have something be legal for 27 years or 30, I don't know how many years it's been legal, and then to take it away where guys have been growing up now practising and playing with it, I just don't think that that's fair to those players."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phil Mickelson</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Like everything in golf, it changes. ... It's not going to ruin me if they ban a long putter one day because I putted good some weeks with the short putter. I won a lot of tournaments. I'll just have to work a bit harder with it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adam Scott</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I feel that no club should be anchored to your body. I was in such a state that I felt that I needed to change something, which I did. I went to the belly. It hasn't really helped me that much, but it has helped me. But I'm for it. Ban it. It's fine."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ernie Els</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As long as it's legal, I'll keep cheating like the rest of them. It's inevitable it [rules] is going to get changed. I think at the end of the day, if we started fresh tomorrow and somebody tried to get the belly putter passed, not a chance."</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I am just sick of this. Look at this mess. I ask you to clean up the kitchen, and you don't do anything.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That's not true, I do lots of stuff.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lucas and his mother argued back and forth until, he said: “You're always nagging me. You don't understand. My life sucks. It really does. Your divorce ruined my life.” Then he burst into tears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His mother was appalled. She and Lucas's father had divorced two years earlier, and Lucas now split his time between their houses, which were 10 minutes apart. She'd been bitterly unhappy in the marriage, and the separation had been her initiative. But while she knew the divorce upset him, she had had no idea how much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Lucas? Do you really feel the divorce ruined your life?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Yes, I do. I have to move back and forth all the time. We don't have as much money, so I can't get stuff like we used to. And I miss our being a family. I know you don't care about it, but I do.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I know some of it's been hard. But now that we're separated we're not fighting all the time. That has to be nicer for you. And you spend far more time with your father than you did when we all lived in the same house.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You just did it for you. What about me? If you're going to have a kid, it's a parent's job to put their kid's happiness first. If all you're going to care about is you, then you shouldn't have had a kid in the first place.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many teenagers will say that their parents divorce was for the best – if their parents truly weren't happy together. But many think otherwise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I mean, if I'm really honest, I don't care if my parents are happy with each other so long as they're nice to me. As long as when they fight, they don't hurt each other.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a bottom line in divorces involving children. With very few exceptions, the reason parents divorce is not for the sake of their children, but for their own sakes. I am not saying that divorces are wrong. All I'm saying is that most divorces involving children have a built-in – to some degree – conflict of interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I know it's not what the kids wanted. But I have a right to get out of a relationship that makes my life miserable.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most parents still feel guilty about it. Which is why it is so tough when your kid confronts you about the divorce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what do you do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, what you want to do is to take their words seriously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What you don't want to do is try to minimize what they are feeling.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are left with a choice. They can continue to fuss about how you ruined their life or they can move on. The importance of you not denying their hurt, nor denying your direct role in it, is that it helps them not to get too hung up about establishing that you are to blame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You own up to it. They can more easily move forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And maybe they come to think, “It did ruin my life and it was Mom's fault. But I guess it's not going to change – and I don't get anything out of blaming her. It's what I have. I might as well make the best of it.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the good-news tidbits tossed out this week during a radio address by B.C. Premier Christy Clark was the promise to spend an extra $165-million for special-needs students in the classroom.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a murky back story to that announcement. The footprints lead to the bog created 10 years ago when the B.C. Liberal government, with Ms. Clark serving as education minister, stripped teachers of the right to negotiate their working conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2002 law took class size and composition – the number of special-needs students integrated into the classroom – out of the collective bargaining process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, in a challenge by the teachers' union, the B.C. Supreme Court ruled the law unconstitutional and invalid because it interfered with teachers' right to negotiate their working conditions freely. The court gave the province a year to fix it – and the deadline is just eight weeks away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the Class Organization Fund that Ms. Clark promised this week – with $30-million for this year, the balance spread out over two more years – is intended to demonstrate that the government is addressing the court order by giving school districts money to hire and train teachers and support staff for special-needs students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It still leaves Education Minister George Abbott with the challenge of explaining this equation: Imposing a fund that B.C.'s teachers rejected as inadequate in talks last fall plus refusing to discuss class sizes equals restoring teachers' bargaining rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the ruling last April, Ms. Clark promised to change the way her government deals with the teachers' union. “We're going to have to make sure we get on a different footing with the teachers' union, just as the court has suggested,” she said at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not much has changed. Instead of bringing class size and composition into contract talks currently under way, the province set up separate negotiations to deal with the court ruling. Neither set of talks has been successful, and so the government is preparing two pieces of legislation this spring. One will impose a new contract – barring a sudden breakthrough next week – and the other will address the court order.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What the government will be able to say is that it tried to reach a deal. The teachers walked away from the negotiations to address the court decision, indignant that the government was proposing only $165-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The ruling did not say we have to recreate all of the world as it existed before 2002,” Mr. Abbott said in an interview this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he is putting the final touches on legislation that “will be entirely mindful of every word in the judgment.” Yes, he acknowledged, there is a constitutional obligation around bargaining on class size and composition. “It is possible that government would consider class size and composition being a bargaining element in the future,” he said. “But there is a distinction between doing that and re-enacting all of the highly inflexible and often unsustainable elements that existed in 2001.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Unsustainable” meaning expensive. The judge calculated that the province was saving $275-million annually by removing caps on class size and composition from the teachers' contract. In today's dollars, the BCTF says, the amount is now $336-million a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan Lambert, president of the BCTF, says the fruitless meetings with government since last April don't add up to restoring bargaining rights. But why turn down the special education funding? “[The $165-million fund] will put vulnerable children and their parents in a horrible race for scarce resources,” she said. “It brings to mind those UNICEF photos of workers in government trucks in sub-Saharan Africa trying to allocate cups of rice to hordes of hungry people.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether Mr. Abbott's legislation will satisfy the courts remains to be seen, but it is almost certain to lead to another court challenge by the BCTF. After 10 years of squabbling, parents of students with special needs can look forward to the next school year with more resources, doled out amid much bitterness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INTERPRETATIONS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What the court said: “It is clear from the history of teachers' labour relations that they have long considered their working conditions a significant priority to be negotiated collectively, and this includes the conditions of class size and composition. … I conclude that the legislation purging the collective agreement of these matters, and prohibiting future collective bargaining over these matters, interfered with the teachers' ability to come together to collectively pursue goals, and significantly undermined the teachers' s. 2 (d) Charter guarantee of freedom of association.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– B.C. Supreme Court Justice Susan Griffin, April 13, 2011</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What the B.C. Teachers' Federation heard: “It's a tremendous victory for teachers, and for students and for parents. It'll have a significant impact on restoring learning conditions in schools. … This is a turning point.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– BCTF president Susan Lambert, April 13, 2011</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What the B.C. government heard: “We understand the B.C. Supreme Court's decision to oblige us to engage in processes that respect the constitutional right of collective bargaining.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governor-General of Canada</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is perhaps the defining question of our time: How to tackle the complex, interrelated challenges of the 21st century in a coherent and effective way?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer, I am convinced, lies in what I call the diplomacy of knowledge, defined as our ability and willingness to work together and share our learning across disciplines and borders. When people achieve the right mixture of creativity, communication and co-operation, remarkable things can happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is learning and the sharing of information so important?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first reason is that, in our globalized world, the well-being of nations is increasingly being defined by the ability to develop and advance knowledge. In other words, knowledge – as opposed to military might or GDP – is gaining momentum as the new currency and passport to success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, information has never been so ubiquitous, and so cheaply and easily shared. By practising the diplomacy of knowledge, we can open up relationships between peoples and foster harmony in an interconnected world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third, as a result of the speed and ease of communications, our world is experiencing unprecedented rates of change. We live in a time of rapid transformations, characterized by risk and opportunity on a global scale. Because of this, we must always look to the evidence – particularly scientific evidence – to help navigate change and inform our choices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fourth, ideas are improved when shared and tested through action. I often draw on Thomas Jefferson's image of a burning candle when illustrating the importance of collaboration. The candle symbolizes not only enlightenment but also the transmission of learning from one person or country to another. And when you light your candle from the flame of my candle, my light is not diminished, it is enhanced. The sharing of knowledge collectively enlightens us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, we must promote the practices that have served us well, including the scientific method – one of the truly great innovations in human history. The fundamentals of mathematics and science have propelled global leaps in communications since the time of the printing press. And, in fact, it was 300 years of discovery in math and science from Newton to Einstein that laid the foundations for the rise of the Internet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The complex issues we face require us to move beyond inter- and multi-disciplinary efforts to adopt truly trans-disciplinary approaches. I am encouraged to see so many of the world's leading scientific minds in Vancouver this week for the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, exploring the idea of creating a global knowledge society to address the challenges of the 21st century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenges are many – affecting our health, food, energy, economy, water, land and climate. That these issues are global in scope and profoundly interconnected only compounds the difficulty – as do the stresses associated with our growing population, now at seven billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, this is a challenge not just for scientists but for all of us. So how do we bring about a smart and caring world that is at once prosperous, sustainable and resilient?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our ability to work together – to practise the diplomacy of knowledge – will be the key to our success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have good reason to be optimistic. Consider just this week's gathering in Vancouver: Scientists and leading thinkers from some 60 countries are in attendance, their approach is collaborative, and their focus is global.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Learning together is an important part of living together. While many of our greatest challenges arise through the interplay of complex problems, so, too, do our greatest advances often occur at the intersections between disciplines. Who knows what a greater understanding of quantum physics will be able to tell us about genetics, or what a better grasp of ecology can teach us about global networks?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The constant, dynamic elements in our learning are creativity, communication and co-operation. Canadians can play an important role in the global knowledge society. Our challenge is to renew our commitment to the principles of scientific learning that have served us well in the past, while drawing on the best thinking in navigating the changes ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aristotle once said, “All men by nature desire to know.” Today, we can perhaps recast this statement for the 21st century, envisaging a world in which all nations are eager to know and to share their learning.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No refugee determination system will ever be perfect. There will always be those who try to game it, as well as many more who cannot access it at all. Immigration Minister Jason Kenney's refugee reforms, aimed at making the process more efficient and decisive, are generally good. If implemented, they will improve an unwieldy asylum program. There are, however, legitimate concerns about a lack of due process in the new bill, known as Protecting Canada's Immigration System Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The legislation rightly focuses on weeding out claimants who are not genuine, and stemming the flow of asylum seekers from countries such as Mexico and Hungary that are democracies with respect for basic rights and freedoms. Last year, the number of refugee claims from Hungary doubled to 4,900; many are Roma. The acceptance rate is only about 2 per cent. Following a spike in asylum claims from Mexico, Ottawa imposed a visa in 2009, which has been the source of great irritation for all Mexicans, with good reason.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fast-tracking refugee claims from these countries, and ensuring failed claimants are promptly deported, is an excellent way to make sure Canada does not become a magnet for abuse. The bill will also implement biometric identification, such as fingerprints and photos, for people who apply for visitor's visas. This welcome change will guard against the use of false identities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. Kenney's decision to eliminate a right of appeal for all refugees from a designated list of “safe countries” is problematic. Critics are concerned it could result in the persecution of genuine refugees. The new bill has also eliminated a committee of experts that was meant to advise the government on which countries should be on the safe-country list. This is unfortunate, and opens the process to political pressure. “If you have to have a safe-country list, input from independent experts would give it more credence,” notes Sharry Aiken, a law professor at Queen's University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kenney's opponents are irked that in introducing the bill, the minister reversed many of the compromises he had agreed to in an earlier version, which was passed under a Conservative minority government in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is to be expected in politics. But it is a shame some of the better ideas didn't survive. The best asylum system isn't just efficient and transparent, but errs on the side of caution in not sending back people to countries where they could be persecuted.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘There are only hard answers and difficult solutions.” So said Don Drummond and his three fellow commissioners about reforming Ontario's health-care system. They could have used the same words for the entire government of Ontario.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario's problem is not that it has big government, per se. If you want to see that, on a per capita basis, head to Alberta or Quebec. As the commission correctly noted, “Ontario runs one of the lowest-cost provincial governments in Canada relative to its GDP and has done so for decades.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario is at or near the bottom in funding universities. The health-care system is not the most expensive in Canada; the welfare rates are not the most generous. It doesn't offer $7-a-day daycare, as in Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No, Ontario's problem is that the size of its government doesn't fit its revenues, and hasn't for a long time. Those revenues have been hit by the slow erosion of Ontario's competitive position, in the face of which governments kept adding spending for which there were insufficient revenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, like the frog in boiling water, the province's fiscal situation slowly weakened. Over the past quarter of a century, Ontario's debt ratio more than doubled to 35 per cent from 14 per cent. Ontario now finds itself lumped in with the three Maritime provinces; unless it changes course, it will find itself level with Quebec's 50-per-cent ratio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most of the past decade, Ontario's growth rate lagged behind the rest of Canada. From being an economic motor for the country, capable of sharing its surplus, Ontario became a drag, incapable of sharing but still required to do so by the perversity of various federal-provincial programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worse, Canada entered into a form of the dreaded “Dutch disease,” whereby the currency soars on the back of high commodity prices, thereby diluting the economy's competitive position. Ontario has suffered from Canada's version of “Dutch disease”: High oil prices and large oil exports keep the currency high, causing competitive problems elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario has itself to blame, too. Its companies didn't innovate enough; its wage rates in too many industries were uncompetitive; and – to come to the nub of the Drummond report – its public sector was too flabby for the revenue base on which it rested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largely unionized providers in major public services – health, K-12, universities, courts, policing – essentially took new moneys the province poured into their institutions and turned them into wage gains rather than productivity improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since about half of the provincial budget is taken up by wages and benefits for the million or so public-sector employees, higher remuneration coupled with no productivity gains spelled trouble. Under Premier Dalton McGuinty, wage gains bought labour peace but no corresponding improvement in output, a politically satisfying but economically deadening outcome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governments, especially the McGuinty government, refused to tell the truth to the electorate. They kept assuming, and hoping, that the robust economic times of yesteryear would return. And they did two things simultaneously: They refused to raise taxes, and they kept on adding new spending programs or letting existing ones expand. In the last election campaign, none of the parties came remotely close to levelling with the voters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP answered every challenge with a call for higher corporate taxes, as if that alone would make difficulties vanish. A more puerile, populist response could scarcely be imagined,save those proposed by the other parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flight from reality that has characterized Ontario's political culture has been completely challenged by the Drummond report. There's no longer any place to hide – although, if one exists, we can expect the politicians at Queen's Park to discover it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it safe to come up for air? Thank God that Valentine's Day, make that Valentine's Week, is finally over.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't get me wrong, I love the beautiful white orchid in a red pot that my husband cannily sent me a week ago, as a “pre-Valentine” gesture – thereby putting the spontaneity back into a holiday that some desperate marketers have done their best to spoil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now that the red gift bags are put away, let's talk about love and lies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Online dating has provided social scientists with a treasure trove – a hunka hunka burnin' data about the lies that people in all age groups tell when they're looking for love. As one article in The New York Times reported late last year, scientific studies show that “about 81 per cent of people misrepresent their height, weight or age in their profiles.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers have apparently gone to the trouble of checking people's drivers' licences against what they said online, and found that on average, “the women described themselves as 8.5 pounds thinner in their profiles than they really were.” Men fudged the truth by two pounds, though they lied more than women about their height, rounding up a half inch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Times article put it, “On the bright side: people tend to tell small lies because, after all, they may eventually meet in person.” (And on the even brighter side, apparently lying about your weight can even spur some people to go on a diet just so they can live up to their online stats.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We all tend to self-idealize, to put our best selves forward and tailor our life stories to appeal to others when we're looking for a mate. So prospective daters rhapsodize about hobbies they have barely tried, like kayaking or gallery hopping. And on the practical side, very few online profiles admit to say, being desperate for work, although in this economy it certainly wouldn't make them unusual.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiously, academics report that few online daters come clean about their politics, which researchers say could be a solid predictor of compatibility. Said one professor to the Times: “People were much more likely to say, ‘I'm fat' than ‘I'm a conservative.'” Now that is funny. What if you're both?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have some women friends who have encountered weird kinds of “truthiness” in online dating. One friend was mystified by a man she met online who told her over coffee that his parents were from Europe. When she innocently asked which country, he responded, “Let's just say Europe.” Apart from sounding like an old Mel Brooks joke – “I love Europe, I carry a picture of it in my wallet”– his manner didn't sit right with her. If he couldn't be straightforward about something as simple as that, what else was he being evasive about?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But of course the online dating era didn't usher in lying during courtship. When my husband and I first met, I told a teeny strategic lie – that I loved fishing – to reel him in. I had read Hemingway and figured how hard could it be to stand hip deep in a trout stream and then adjourn for a picnic of cold white wine and roast chicken sandwiches, all the while intoning “and the sun also rose and the fish shimmered in the sunlight and it felt fine.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he, in turn, told me a whopper. Deep in an early conversation about our backgrounds, I learned he was a member of a Montreal Jewish family very active in their community. “So does that mean your parents would prefer that you marry a Jewish girl?” I asked, my self-protective antenna aquiver. He put his hand on my knee and replied, “Not really.” Hah!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the heart wants what it wants. Love is an emotion, but it's also an instinct. We see or feel something in someone we meet and we determinedly reach for it, because our heart is fluttering, but also because somehow we know it's in our best interests to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turns out true love can deal with a little – and in some cases a lot – of misrepresentation. Where would Shakespeare's plays be without this plot device?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Occasionally, my husband and I will smile at each other and say, “Look where our lying got us.” Admittedly, it led to a life-altering decision on my part to eventually convert to Judaism, which I've never regretted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But also to a lovely long marriage. In other words, to a very good place. But not, alas, to a trout stream where the fish are biting and it feels fine.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘I ought to punch you right in the nose,” said Brian Linehan the first time I met him.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A celebrated broadcast interviewer from the seventies until his death in 2004, Linehan was not known for being confrontational. Widely admired for his deep-dish knowledge of the movies and loquacious interviewing style, he was often as famous as his celebrity guests, as the title of his biography, Starring Brian Linehan, suggests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His threat came in response to a question: Why would he want to be host of the Genies? At the time, I was young and thought everyone knew awards shows were a crock. The Oscars too often rewarded schmaltz over genius (D.W. Griffith, Howard Hawks and Alfred Hitchcock won consolation awards). In the seventies, serious artists such as George C. Scott, Marlon Brando and Woody Allen shunned the event. From another perspective, though, these events are the apotheosis of a celebrity- and movie-loving culture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Linehan's point of view, it was an insult to even ask him such a question, after all his years of support for Canadian film artists and love of the movies. After more talk and many more coffees (no refills, fresh cups), he warmed up. Somehow, after the rough start, that half-hour interview stretched into six hours of movie talk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Linehan continued to support Canadian talent even after his death in 2004, when his estate became the Brian Linehan Charitable Foundation, which trustee Michael Levine says promotes Linehan's legacy as an interviewer and continues his “quest for a star system in Canada.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting this week, in a co-venture with the Toronto International Film Festival and the National Screen Institute, the charity's website is releasing about 50 of Linehan's interviews online (www.brianlinehan.ca/video/[http://www.brianlinehan.ca/video/]). Only about five of the 33 subjects so far are Canadian (and two of those – Anne Murray and Burton Cummings – are musicians), but they're an enjoyable flash from the past. The Linehan foundation has also donated hundreds of thousands of dollars in the last few years to Hot Docs, TIFF and various film and theatre programs to foster Canadian young talent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the phrase “star system” that I stumble on. In the basic sense, I suppose, it means a training system for work in movies. Yet the term is inextricably tied to the classic Hollywood studio factory model of the 1920s to 1940s, in which actors were often groomed, given new names and even fictitious backgrounds, then marketed more on glamour that talent. Hollywood was the American Dream in a hurry: One day you're in a drug store in a clingy sweater, the next you're an adored celebrity. It was part of the illusion machine, and as actors fought for more freedom from the 1940s on, the system collapsed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of classic Hollywood, the American movies still often operate on a celebrity-focused studio system. As screenwriting sage William Goldman has pointed out, top stars routinely bring in their own writers to boost their roles and ruin good scripts. It's not much of a model for anyone else. In the relatively tiny English-Canadian cinema niche (about 1 per cent of domestic box office) it makes more sense to support imaginative directors and versatile actors that bring strong stories to life – stars might emerge, but let's not get it backward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't know if Brian Linehan believed there could be a glamorous, star-studded Canadian movie industry, though it's been one of those questions that's been circling around English-Canadian film for years: Where is our star system? I think we already know the answer. The pull of a superior gravity force has dragged it south. You want Canadian stars? Go to the multiplex: There's Rachel McAdams in The Vow and Ryan Reynolds in Safe House, the No. 1 and 2 films at the North American box office.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moderate air pollution levels, currently considered to pose little risk to human health, may not be so safe after all.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two separate studies released this week concluded that inhaling commonplace pollutants can trigger heart attacks or strokes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One study looked at the big picture. The researchers performed a meta-analysis of 34 previous studies. Every major component of air pollution, with the exception of ozone, was associated with an increased risk of heart attacks, according to their findings published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We found the same results in Europe, the Americas and in Asia,” said the lead researcher, Hazrije Mustafic of the Paris Descartes University in France.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And the majority of studies were done in cities where the air pollution levels were under the recommendations of the World Health Organization,” she noted. That suggests pollution generally deemed safe could still have “a deleterious effect.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second new study focused on the residents of a single American city – Boston, where the air is considered to be relatively clean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers reviewed the medical records of more than 1,700 stroke patients who were treated at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center over a 10-year period. They matched the onset of stroke symptoms in each patient to hourly air pollution measurements collected at the nearby environmental monitoring station of the Harvard School of Public Health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We found that the risk of stroke was about 35 per cent higher on days when the air quality was classified as moderate compared to good days with lower pollution levels,” said the lead researcher, Gregory Wellenius at Brown University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That is a pretty big jump, especially considering that both these levels – the good days and the moderate days – were below the currently accepted standards for particulate matter pollution set forth by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the pollution came from traffic, according to the study published in Archives of Internal Medicine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers said there are numerous ways that foul air could trigger a heart attack or stroke in individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Past studies have shown for instance that inhaling outdoor air particles can cause inflammation, change how blood vessels work, increase the chances that platelets in the blood will form a clot, and disrupt the autonomic nervous system, which is responsible for controlling heart rate and blood pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any one of these factors could spell trouble for people with atherosclerosis, or existing plaque in blood vessels. One of these fatty deposits could rupture, creating a clot that blocks blood flow to the heart or brain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If future research confirms the findings from these new studies, public-health officials may need to revise their pollution standards, said Dr. Wellenius. That could mean tougher measures to curb pollution. Plus, people with cardiovascular disease and lung ailments may be urged to avoid prolonged exposure outdoors on more days of year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aspirin therapy not without risks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're a healthy adult who pops a low-dose Aspirin daily in the hopes of preventing a heart attack you may be doing yourself more harm than good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the conclusion of a study that analyzed data from nine previous trials involving more than 100,000 participants for an average of six years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doctors have long known that Aspirin, which has anti-clotting properties, can help prevent a second heart attack, a stroke, or death in individuals who have already had a heart attack or stroke. But its ability to avert a first heart attack or stroke – known as primary prevention – has not been demonstrated in people who are free of cardiovascular disease when they start taking Aspirin on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new meta-analysis, led by Kausik Ray from the University of London, provides fresh insights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the findings published in Archives of Internal Medicine, there's no difference in the rate of fatal heart attacks or fatal strokes between healthy individuals taking a daily Aspirin and those popping placebos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study, however, did show a 10 per cent drop in non-fatal heart attacks. But this benefit must be measured against a 30 per cent spike in gastrointestinal bleeding and a small increase in hemorrhagic strokes (or brain bleeds).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you are at low risk of a heart attack or stroke, Aspirin is really not going to have much benefit and it will increase your risk of bleeding,” said Samia Mora, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who wrote a commentary published along with the study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What the new study doesn't address is the issue of “borderline” patients – those who are not in the pink of health, but don't yet have obvious signs of heart disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Mora noted that four large clinical trials are currently investigating the use of Aspirin in this patient population and results are several years out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, she said borderline patients should discuss the pros and cons of treatment with their physicians. And, she stressed, they shouldn't attempt to self-medicate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curbing butts and booze</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A medication used to help smokers butt out may also curb the use of alcohol, new research suggests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a series of experiments, heavy-to-moderate social drinkers were given either a dose of varenicline or a placebo three hours before consuming an alcoholic drink. Compared to the placebo, “varenicline increased the unpleasant effects of alcohol and decreased drug liking,” said the lead researcher, Emma Childs at the University of Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although one small study doesn't prove it would work long term, the researchers said it would be worthwhile having a treatment for people struggling with both tobacco and alcohol addictions – two vices that often go hand in hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study was published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research. In Canada, varenicline is sold under the brand name of Champix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But varenicline is not without issues. The smoking-cessation drug has been linked to reports of psychiatric problems including suicidal thoughts, hostility, aggression, disturbing dreams and depression.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ANSWER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've all done our time in Caribbean all-inclusive buffet queues where somehow everything tastes the same. So let's forgo the all-you-can-eat and sample what's simmering under the corrugated tin roofs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can find these sidewalk kitchens across the islands – just ask a reputable taxi driver to take you to a local favourite, says Anne Brobyn, a real-estate tourism expert with Hibiscus International, who has travelled extensively and worked throughout the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jamaica, she says, combines both your craving for good beaches and authentic cuisine. Dining at local stands is cheap to boot – often for as little as $5 a meal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Expect sides of roasted breadfruit or corn, some ackee and sweet treats, such as tamarind balls and raw sugar cane,” says Brobyn. “Wash it all down with a local beer, Irish moss [a seaweed drink] or a soursop.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eating at these slow-cooking stands will both satiate your appetite and offer time with locals and island culture. And a note on food fears: “I've never gotten sick from roadside eating so my experiences have all been very positive,” Brobyn says. Here are her picks for five memorable roadside eateries across Jamaica:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Port Antonio: To the north of Boston Beach, there is an alley known for its jerk stands. “Also located at the end of this alley is Great Huts (greathuts.com), a unique village resort with Rock's Café,” she says. “Great food.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southwest Jamaica: Here, find Billy's Grassy Park, one of the most famous roadside eateries near Middle Quarters, St. Elizabeth. “Known for his shrimp – curried, peppered, fried and in one of the most delicious soups I've ever tasted.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Negril: Track down Ras Rody's (rasrody.com) for his excellent vegetarian and organic food sold under a thatched roof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ocho Rios: Settle into Miss T's Kitchen (misstskitchen.com) in the heart of the city. “It's a rustic restaurant located in a pretty garden setting,” Brobyn says. “It features colourful decor and amazing food.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falmouth: Plantations are another way to experience the island's cuisine, such as at Good Hope Country House (goodhopejamaica.com), which overlooks the Martha Brae River and the Cockpit Mountains.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some weeks ago, before Rick Nash trade speculation turned a lot of sane human beings into wide-eyed, raving lunatics, I was chatting with an NHL general manager and the subject was trade rumours – real or imagined – and how much work they generate for his peers in the Twitter/blogosphere era.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally, the GM said, if a rumour involving a prominent player had even a whiff of logic to it, it requires him to touch base with the agent and sometimes even meet with the player to clarify what was really going on. The GM also needs to make time to take phone calls from peers, many of whom are checking if there was any foundation to the speculation. And then, of course, there are the members of the media, chasing news minute-by-minute, trying to get an accurate lay of the land. Poof! Half a day can go up in smoke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I laughed (ruefully, I think) and told him my latest theory: Somebody was missing a sure money-making opportunity by failing to register the domain name NHLFaketrades.net. There is so much interest in what happens at the trade deadline – and so much wild speculation about who may or may not change teams – someone may as well create a forum so people who dream up stuff can post it somewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(I know I did as a college student, killing time between classes at Scarborough College. Frank Adornetto and I would shuffle so many pieces here, there and everywhere that eventually we'd turned Pat Boutette, Jerry Butler and Jimmy Jones into Guy Lafleur and Steve Shutt.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I also challenged the GM to name any two teams, and I could instantly produce a plausible-enough trade rumour that would at least force him think twice before dismissing it out of hand. He didn't want to play along, so I did it for him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I picked the Philadelphia Flyers and Los Angeles Kings out of a hat because they will be active at the deadline, and so far, most of the speculation involves one or the other or both. Everybody knew the Flyers were shopping for a defenceman and last Thursday, they landed Nicklas Grossman from the Dallas Stars for a second- and third-round pick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I put forward a scenario in which the Flyers aimed higher, arguing that because the Kings had a surplus of <span class="companylink">NHL</span> defencemen, they could surrender a top-four rearguard in exchange high-end scoring help up-front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too bad James van Riemsdyk is hurt. Healthy, they could swap him, and maybe a little something else, to the Kings for blueliner Jack Johnson. Both are young Americans – van Riemsdyk was the second-overall pick in 2007, Johnson third in 2005 – and both still have a ways to go to meet their potential. Likely Philadelphia would need to sweeten the pot slightly because defencemen of that pedigree are harder to come by than forwards, so add in a second-round draft pick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the sort of transaction that, if it ever did happen, it wouldn't make you think: That's crazy. Nor is it the sort of outrageous Corey Perry-for-Cory Schneider-and-spare-parts nonsense that can be easily dismissed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You'll have to trust me on this one, too, but I also threw out a suggestion that the Chicago Blackhawks and Buffalo Sabres might hook up as possible trading partners: Chicago landing a goalie (Ryan Miller) in exchange for the hometown boy, Patrick Kane, currently in the midst of an awful scoring slump. Who was more surprised than me to hear, about a week later, a rumour suggesting exactly that – speculation that forced Blackhawks GM Stan Bowman to deny that his team was shopping for a goalie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So today, here on the newly minted NHLFaketrades.net hub, let's begin by pondering why all those killjoy GMs keep explaining why certain players aren't moving after all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Islanders GM Garth Snow quashed the Evgeni Nabokov speculation. He hopes to re-sign him. The Carolina Hurricanes are keeping Tuomo Ruutu, also in the hopes of signing him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nash is available from the Columbus Blue Jackets, but after all that early breathless speculation, everyone is taking a step back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I can't even bring myself to make up any Schneider rumours because I can't see the Vancouver Canucks trading him just yet, but if they do, wouldn't the Tampa Bay Lightning be a good landing place for the rights to young defenceman Victor Hedman? If you had Hedman maybe you could give up Alexander Edler, too, in a package for a top-six forward … like maybe Nash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except Nash will likely end up in Los Angeles, where he fills a need, gets to play with former Canadian Olympic teammate Mike Richards and maybe is the marquee attraction the Kings so desperately need. After trading away Dominic Moore to the San Jose Sharks for a draft choice, Tampa's got to be thinking about moving winger Ryan Malone – why shouldn't he be a King, too, in exchange for Dustin Penner's expiring contract and a second-round draft choice?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blueliner Pavel Kubina is going somewhere and he was a mainstay of the Tampa team that knocked Philadelphia out in the 2004 Eastern Conference final (the Flyers have long memories), why wouldn't he end up there? Chicago has the greater need on the blueline, so they should be in there swinging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nashville got into the act Friday, by dealing off a big “name,” Blake Geoffrion, to the Montreal Canadiens, in exchange for a big man, 6-foot-7 Hal Gill, who has the size, playoff pedigree and penalty-killing skills the Predators crave. And if Montreal decides to dish off further assets, put Travis Moen in a Detroit Red Wings uniform in the next two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Columbus forward Sami Pahlsson won a Stanley Cup in Anaheim; and with the Ducks tilting over to the buyers' side of the equation thanks to a 14-2-3 run, he might be better as their No. 3 centre than anyone they've tried in the interim. See? What fun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hopefully, the San Jose-Tampa and Philly-Dallas trades broke the ice, and with the deadline only 10 days away, things can only heat up from here on in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if it does, check back often just in case you heard it hear first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NHLFaketrades.net. Patent pending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">********</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AROUND THE RINKS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For sale: sold</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surprise. The Tampa Bay Lightning became the first team to identify itself as a seller. General manager Steve Yzerman dished off centre Dominic Moore to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for a second-round pick. It is the third time in his career (nine different <span class="companylink">NHL</span> stops) Moore has been swapped for a No. 2. The attraction for San Jose was his playoff pedigree (11 points in 18 games for Tampa last year), plus his versatility. Moore can play centre or wing, and kill penalties. Moore's offence hasn't been there (19 points), but since this has to be the year San Jose makes a playoff splash, they believe he'll be a good fit in the dressing room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big picture in big d</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dallas Stars received second and third-round draft choices from the Philadelphia Flyers, a surprisingly decent return for defenceman Nicklas Grossman, who was playing more than 16 minutes a night for the Stars and deemed expendable because of their blueline depth. Even with new ownership and the promise of more dollars to spend, Dallas is intelligently thinking big-picture thoughts. If the next collective agreement keeps teams tight to the salary cap, then the Stars could be in an excellent position to exploit their financial flexibility. The Stars had the lowest payroll in the league, even before ditching Grossman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No fire in flames drafts</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Injuries are part of the reason, but when the Calgary Flames play the Los Angeles Kings on Saturday, they will have exactly two players the franchise drafted, T.J. Brodie and Lance Bouma, in the lineup. Both were selected in the 2008 draft, Bouma 78th overall, Brodie 114th. Not bad for any team, but exceptional for Calgary, which has had so much trouble at the draft table in the past 15 years that you'd be hard-pressed to identify the second-best player chosen over that span behind the clear No. 1, Dion Phaneuf. It might be Jarrett Stoll, or Travis Moen, or goalie Craig Anderson, but the Flames didn't sign any of them to a contract. Stoll and Anderson went back into the draft as re-entry players, while Moen turned pro with Chicago, signing as a free agent. It might be Keith Aulie or Matthew Lombardi, both of whom are in the Toronto Maple Leafs organization along with Phaneuf. It may eventually be Mikael Backlund, currently out with an injury. But if anyone thinks the path to rebuilding Calgary is through the draft, they hasn't been paying close attention to how well that has worked for essentially an entire generation.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON -- dsaunders@globeandmail.com</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We always knew it could happen: A devout Muslim heads a conservative political party that takes office in a multicultural Western country, then leads a campaign to enforce mandatory prayer and to lobby for religious-based values and laws. How will people react?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, it happened in Britain this week, and here's how they reacted: Judges and leading thinkers fought back in the name of a secular state, but the Queen, the Pope and Britain's right-wing newspapers all spoke up in support of the Muslim party leader's campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was because the leader in question is Baroness Warsi, chairman of the Conservative Party and a senior minister in David Cameron's government. She's a popular figure among Tories and an entertaining personality who frequently appears on British TV. She's also a devout Muslim, a faith-based cultural conservative and a staunch defender of religion's role in public life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her campaign began Monday, after Britain's High Court ruled that the practice of holding prayers during municipal council meetings is unconstitutional (as, by extension, may be those held during sittings of the House of Commons). Prayer, the judge ruled, is a private matter that has no place in the formal proceedings of a legal assembly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Baroness shot back, saying her country is falling prey to “militant secularization” and arguing that religious belief should be “a voice in the public sphere.” She went to Rome and met the Pope, who appeared to give her arguments his blessing. Religion, she said, should be a basis of public life: “To create a more just society, Britons must feel stronger in their religious identities.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right-leaning newspapers laid on the two-inch headlines known by insiders as “Jesus type” and backed her: “Britain being taken over by ‘militant secularists,' ” screamed The Daily Telegraph. The Daily Mail and The Times front pages charged that religion was “under attack” and “on the rack.” Then the Queen joined in, using a meeting with representatives of nine major religions to make the case: “We should remind ourselves of the significant position of the Church of England in our nation's life.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only months before, many of those newspapers (and some Tory MPs) were expressing equally loud alarm at the prospect of Muslim prayer rooms in universities or the existence of sharia divorce tribunals. Now, in the face of secularism, they're taking the opposite position. In the fast-moving heart of the religion wars, you can feel the ground shifting beneath your feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In truth, no one is calling for a religious state or attacking faith. Rather, we are witnessing a showdown, across the West, between two competing definitions of “freedom of religion.” In one definition, the public sphere is a wide-open space: Citizens are free to try to impose religion, to invoke their gods in legislation, to wear whatever symbols they like. It's a marketplace of beliefs, and may the strongest prevail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the other definition, that sphere is a neutral space: Religion is private and public places are unencumbered by competitions for divine supremacy. This definition recognizes that freedom of religion depends on a strongly defended freedom from religion. And freedom from religion is just as important for non-believers, who don't want public life to be corrupted with spiritualism, as it is for devout believers, who don't want their sacred beliefs to be sullied by the vicissitudes of politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Baroness Warsi's intervention is a positive development for both sides. On the religious free-for-all side, she has shown that Muslims can join the other two Abrahamic religions in pressing for privileges without being accused of engaging in a “clash of civilizations.” At the same time, she helps people realize that the problem in public life isn't Islam but religion itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Britain might follow the lead of Ontario, where public outcry over proposed Muslim sharia tribunals led the government to realize that Christians and Jews had been allowed similar religious-based tribunals, and that the whole thing was a bad idea. By putting an end to the practice of religious law, Ontario relegated religion to the place it works best, as a philosophy of private enlightenment (if only the same could be done for schools).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're entering an age when Muslims are no longer seen as alien outsiders but as ordinary participants in public life. If earlier public hysteria over their beliefs had a benefit, though, it was in making us all realize the value of a neutral, secular public life.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to Jason Spezza's career, everybody is an expert, even little Sophia.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“SHHHHOOOOOOOOOOTTTT!” his 20-month-old daughter shouts when the <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span> play home games at Scotiabank Place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“She hears the crowd,” Spezza says with the chuckle that is as much a part of him as those throat-catching passes that can run the gamut from brilliant to bizarre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He hears it, too. “Shoot the puck!” they scream from the stands. “Get rid of him!” they've screamed on the radio. “Bench him!” “Trade him!” It is the price a gifted and adventurous player must pay when playing in front of 20,000 general managers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But lately, they more often cheer, especially this past week as the once tumbling Senators went into Florida and returned home with two victories, a renewed grip on that slippery playoff position and a stunning seven points for Jason Spezza that rocketed him, briefly, to the No. 2 spot in the NHL scoring race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Jason has obviously been leading the charge for us,” captain Daniel Alfredsson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was a nice week,” Spezza adds, “especially with my dad around.” (Rino Spezza was one of many fathers joining the Senators' warm-weather road trip.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“No matter how old you get, you still like to play well in front of your dad,” the son says. “We're all big kids anyway, and you're always trying to impress your parents.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spezza, 28, has been impressing his parents and others since he won a cute-baby contest in Mississauga and his picture landed on the front page of a Toronto newspaper. He was on posters as a toddler, doing commercials for Minute Maid at 4 and a model for Woolco and K-Mart at 6. He had an agent before he scored his first goal, but once he did start playing hockey, he was, again, an instant star. So precocious was the young Spezza that he was allowed to become an underage junior at 15. Tall, with astounding reach and vision, he was a playmaker so skilled he was projected as Canadian hockey's next superstar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 18, he went to the 2001 NHL draft certain he would be taken second – behind Russian sensation Ilya Kovalchuk – but uncertain as to the team. The New York Islanders held the No. 2 pick, but then-general manager Mike Milbury let it be known he was open to offers. Four teams were thought to be talking with the Isles: Boston Bruins, Pittsburgh Penguins, Florida Panthers and <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senators GM at that time, Marshall Johnston, knew he had to make a deal that involved the talented but unpopular Alexei Yashin, who seemed forever to be holding up the cash-strapped Senators for more money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was really nervous,” Johnston remembers. “There was no way we were going to re-sign him. If we did, I could feel the rope around my neck on Parliament Hill.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Johnston wanted defenceman Zdeno Chara in return and Milbury agreed, also adding utility forward Bill Muckalt. Johnston pitched for the draft pick as well, but knew he would back down if Milbury considered it a deal-breaker. “I didn't sleep a wink that night,” Johnston says. “Mike called at 7 a.m. and we agreed to the deal.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spezza's parents were told that night that he'd be going to Ottawa, but they kept it from him so that their young son would properly “experience” the excitement of draft day. He was ecstatic when Ottawa chose him – Canadian team, close to home – but soon after was crushed. At training camp, they told him they were returning him to junior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is a men's league,” Senators coach Jacques Martin said at the time, “and he's still a boy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a tough time for Johnston as well. He knew his coach was so defence-oriented Spezza would instantly be in Martin's doghouse. He also knew the franchise was crumbling and they could ill afford to sign Spezza. When he asked the teenager into his office and told him, Spezza sobbed for half an hour. The next day, Johnston flew to Toronto to tell Rino face-to-face, and the father was equally upset. Jason Spezza, for the first time in his life, wasn't the star of the moment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he did make the team, his buccaneer play made Martin – and many in the stands – cringe. Blind passes, end-to-end rushes, stick-handling until pucks were lost. The team crushed his hopes again by sending him to Binghamton to play in the minors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The lockout,” Johnston is convinced, “was a godsend for Jason.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With no NHL, Spezza spent the 2004-05 season in Binghamton, won the AHL scoring championship, was named league MVP, matured and regained his confidence. “I would like to have played my first couple of years,” he says. “It was tough going through the growing pains of that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he got through them. And by 2007, Jason Spezza was centring what was considered the top line in hockey – Spezza, Alfredsson and Dany Heatley – and the Senators went all the way to the Stanley Cup final before losing to the Anaheim Ducks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The years since have been somewhat tumultuous in Ottawa, with the Senators last year deciding to rebuild. The youngster, Spezza, was now the veteran, heir apparent to Alfredsson, who, at 39, may have but one or two seasons left to play. They hold equal court in the dressing room, with Spezza as comfortable in the spotlight as he was a quarter century ago as a child model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spezza thinks of himself as more of “a team player” these days – fewer blind passes, less gambling, but still creative – and is convinced his personal success this year has been but a happy result of the overall team play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever it is – new coach Paul MacLean, deft tweaking by GM Bryan Murray, reborn play of Alfredsson, Spezza shooting more – it has worked more than not this season, the recent wins picking the team up from a losing streak that had reached seven games and, once again, quieting the fans of Scotiabank Place.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week's discussion of “green behind the ears,” a careless melding of green and wet behind the ears, prompted thoughts of other mix-and-match expressions.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes the corruptions are deliberate. “Seeing is believing” is regularly transformed into “seeing is deceiving.” But sometimes it's hard to tell. Victor Schiro, mayor of New Orleans from 1961 to 1970, was given to such utterances as “Don't believe any false rumours unless you hear them from me.” He is also remembered for the phrases “That's the way the cookie bounces” and “That's the way the ball crumbles.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking for a needle in a haystack, a difficult task, is often rephrased as looking for a needle in a needle stack. Trouble is, nobody can agree on whether that job is difficult (looking for a particular needle) or easy (looking for any needle).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Cochrane, in a blog on silicon.com in 2009, wrote, “As the Web has grown we have migrated from searching for a ‘needle in a haystack' (easy) to looking for a ‘needle in a needle stack' (hard).” But in 2010, two civil-rights organizations were quoted by the Los Angeles Times as saying it was easy to find infringements of rights at Los Angeles City College. “Finding a First Amendment violation at LACC is like looking for a needle in a needle stack.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To confuse matters, the Campbelltown-Macarthur Advertiser in Australia carried this sentence last May: “I feel sorry for Smiths trying to research their family tree – not so much needles in a haystack, more like finding a piece of hay in a needle stack.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One lasting liberty involves William Congreve's 1697 line in The Mourning Bride that “music hath charms to soothe the savage breast, to soften rocks or bend a knotted oak.” In 1792, James Bramston wrote of music soothing “the savage beast.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both expressions are still in use. The Vancouver Sun wrote last September that “music has charms to soothe the savage breast of someone trying to sort out the sequence of things,” while the Vancouver Province wrote last August that Iran had disingenuously offered to send human-rights observers to a riot-torn London “to help soothe the savage beast that is the oppressed British teenager.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“To put the cat among the pigeons” means to create a stir, to introduce a disruptive or galvanizing element. The Oxford English Dictionary traces the phrase to 1841, although there is a 1706 reference to “the cat is in the Dove-house” (“when a Man is got among the Women”).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Occasionally, I come across a variation on the phrase: to put the cat among the penguins. Whether it began as a mistake or as a humorous play on words, I do not know, although I am inclined to suspect humour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 2002 article on silicon.com said, “That'll put the cat among the penguins. <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> has stunned its archrival in the Linux camp [an open-source operating system] with news it will be exhibiting at LinuxWorld Expo, set to be held in San Francisco this August.” The allusion was to cartoon penguins used as Linux icons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But did the expression start as a reference to Linux, or has it led an unrelated parallel life? Last fall, Britain's Daily Telegraph carried an interview with rugby veterans Kenny Logan, a former Scottish international, and Josh Lewsey, a retired English star. After the Irish upset the favoured Aussies in early round play, Logan said it was tough to predict the winner of the Rugby World Cup (New Zealand won). “Look at Ireland and Australia – that put a real cat among the penguins.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A startled Lewsey asked, “A cat among the penguins?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Logan replied, “My cousin used to say that. I don't know.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't know either, and I am certainly not encouraging anyone to put a cat among birds of any stripe. I'm just curious about how such corruptions catch on. Coincidentally, a book by poet Kit Wright called Cat Among the Pigeons was published in 1989 – by <span class="companylink">Penguin Books</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's been fascinating to listen to the activist comments coming from the B.C. judiciary over backlogs in the court system. It seems each day brings another judge lambasting the government for its unconscionable underfunding of the system, which has created unprecedented delays and led to an historic number of stays of proceedings.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or so we're told.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This development has been revelatory given how thin-skinned judges usually are about any criticism of the job they do, especially by anyone in government. This is why attorneys-general learn early on that, to the extent that they disagree with any decision from the judiciary, they do it with the greatest of respect and the appropriate amount of genuflecting and so on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is also why the B.C. government has mostly taken the shots directed at it from various jurists without shooting back. And goodness knows, if it wanted to, the government could easily turn the tables on the judges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reasons for the crisis in the B.C. court system are more complex than the judges are letting on, but their unusually pointed comments from the bench have been getting most of the headlines. Consequently, the debate has been framed mostly around money. If the government threw more dollars at the court system, all the problems would be solved. Hire more judges at $230,000 a year, not including benefits, and presto: crisis over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, I've got another idea. Before we ask taxpayers to dig into their pockets to finance more judges and hire more Crown prosecutors to attack delays in the system, how about asking judges to do more first. How about we get judges, the Crown and defence lawyers together and say: how can we make the system work more efficiently?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, this has already happened here, and elsewhere, because the problem has been long-standing, and the issues the B.C. court system is experiencing are not unique to this jurisdiction. The B.C. government has ordered another review that will produce a report that will be just the latest look inside the province's criminal justice system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yvon Dandurand, senior associate at the International Centre for Criminal Law Reform and Criminal Justice Policy at the University of the Fraser Valley, conducted one himself in 2009. The report, entitled Addressing Inefficiencies in the Criminal Justice Process, was prepared for the B.C. Justice Efficiencies Project, Criminal Justice Reform Secretariat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A serious review of not just the B.C. system but what is going on elsewhere in the world to address common issues, the study looked at a number of possible reforms. It talked about systemic inefficiencies created, in part, by a process designed for a world that existed hundreds of years ago. The world has changed, but the criminal justice system has not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also suggested that judges need to examine their role in the system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don't think there is any question that judges need to provide greater leadership in terms of the management of the process,” Mr. Dandurand said in an interview on Friday. “It doesn't mean [the delays are] their fault, it simply means they have a role to play that they have been reluctant to play very often.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And by no means is Mr. Dandurand's view in this regard particularly provocative or groundbreaking. It has been made by many who have looked at problems with our court system in Canada, including the most cited review in this area, the 2008 LeSage-Code Report on Speeding up Major Criminal Cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judges need to take control of their courtrooms. They need to get far more aggressive with the Crown and defence in terms of timelines and cross-examinations that drag on for days. Judges need to get tougher with lawyers about getting their act together before a trial begins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's easy to blame the government for underfunding the system. But perhaps it should be more legitimately criticized for not bringing in the types of reforms necessary to make the system more efficient – including making judges more accountable for delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, the government cited an impaired driving case that was stayed on the grounds of unreasonable delay. In this particular matter, there were seven proceedings to deal with the first appearance of the accused. The case kept getting adjourned and adjourned until it was eventually thrown out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is that the government's fault? Or is it more honestly the fault of the Crown, defence or judge in the case?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this example is not unusual.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps, our judges should talk about ways to improve the court system that don't simply involve spending more money. And maybe they should look in their own backyard first for some of those solutions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to Don Drummond, the smart economist with the impeccable reputation, we now have a detailed blueprint for restoring Ontario's fiscal sanity. The choice is clear: Either we get a grip on our finances, or a kid with red suspenders will show up and downgrade our credit rating.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's just one problem. The likelihood that the government can do what Don Drummond says it has to do is approximately zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dalton McGuinty got elected three times because he seems so nice. All he ever promised was good things – good things for kindergarteners and postsecondary students, for teachers and solar-energy producers. He was Premier Dad. He gave us Family Day. He said Ontario was the most prosperous and progressive place on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, it's not. It's the rust belt of Confederation. And now Ontarians need a Mean Dad. We need someone who's willing to make the Harris years look like the Teddy Bears' Picnic. We need someone who is willing to alienate all of Mr. McGuinty's core supporters – the teachers, nurses and government workers he worked so hard to keep on side. Mr. McGuinty is constitutionally unable to enrage and betray them. Besides, he has already declared that all-day kindergarten is untouchable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Premier has not primed the public for austerity. He has plied them with candy and ice cream. According to a Forum Research poll, 53 per cent of respondents want to keep all-day kindergarten, and 57 per cent want to keep the new tuition grant for postsecondary students. Austerity is someone else's problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McGuinty does not want to end his career as Mike Harris, the premier whose name is synonymous with hardball tactics and bitter labour confrontations. Even today, decades later, teachers cannot utter his name without loathing. The vile Mr. Harris cut provincial spending by 4 per cent in his first term. To balance the books by 2018, in real per capita terms Mr. McGuinty will have to cut by the equivalent of 16 per cent. Mr. Drummond called cuts of such magnitude “unprecedented in postwar Canada.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mike Harris was elected premier, at least people knew what was coming. The province was in rotten shape and he had a mandate to set things right. He was also lucky. The world's economy was on a roll, and Ontario's revenues soon shot up. Mr. McGuinty is not so lucky. The world's economy has flat-lined, and he can't count on growth to bail him out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Drummond has come up with hundreds of recommendations for cost-cutting. Most of them will be excruciatingly hard to implement. They are not simply about restraining pay. They require fundamental reforms to deeply entrenched work practices and rigid professional boundaries. Every affected group – all the public-sector workers in the province, to say nothing of seniors with their Lipitor prescriptions – will fight like cornered rats to protect their turf. No appeals to the broader public interest will persuade them to sacrifice what Mr. Drummond says they must. Besides, if kindergarten is exempt, then why not them?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Education – the Premier's pet portfolio – provides a snapshot of the challenge. Mr. McGuinty's aim for education was to buy labour peace and improve outcomes. Noble goals, providing you can contain costs. Ontario did not. Over the past decade, student enrolment shrank by 6 per cent, but education staff grew by 24,000. Most of those are non-teaching jobs. The combination of increased funding and declining enrolment means that per-pupil funding has soared by 56 per cent – from $7,201 to $11,207. Special education funding alone went up by $893-million, or 55 per cent. Fourteen per cent of Grade 12 students spend an extra year in Grade 12 – for free. Teachers' entitlements include up to six months of unused sick days when they retire. Teachers' retirement benefits will have to be reduced. And so on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, teachers unions have already started to bite back. The Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation has pronounced the recommendations “extremely confrontational,” and warns that if implemented, they will do irreparable harm to our children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health care is even worse. The status quo is almost impossible to change. Ask doctors if pharmacists should be allowed to prescribe drugs, and they'll go ballistic. I once asked a room full of family doctors why I needed to see a doctor (instead of, say, a nurse-practitioner) to be diagnosed for a simple urinary tract infection. They were aghast. What if I had cancer? Multiply this example by a thousand and you'll start to understand how hard it is to reform health care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The built-in bias for the status quo reflects the reality that the various parts of government are understood, defended and changed mainly by those who benefit from their existence,” wrote economics writer Robert Samuelson. “What's sacrificed is the broader public good.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for why politicians would rather give in than fight, the answer is obvious. “We know what we have to do,” one beleaguered European politician said. “ We just don't know how to get re-elected after we do it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So keep an eye out for the kid in red suspenders. If Dalton can't shake things up, he will.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, an admission: I spend a lot more time mining the Oscar nominations list for trends or sociological meaning than anyone probably should. But this year, as I examined the four acting categories, I struck a promising vein: In terms of box office, the pictures for which women are nominated are kicking the men's pictures' butts.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So you can keep the players straight, here are the nominees:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lead actor: Demian Bichir, A Better Life; George Clooney, The Descendants; Jean Dujardin, The Artist; Gary Oldman, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy; Brad Pitt, Moneyball.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supporting actor: Kenneth Branagh, My Week with Marilyn; Jonah Hill, Moneyball; Nick Nolte, Warrior; Christopher Plummer, Beginners; Max von Sydow, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lead actress: Glenn Close, Albert Nobbs; Viola Davis, The Help; Rooney Mara, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo; Meryl Streep, The Iron Lady; Michelle Williams, My Week with Marilyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supporting actress: Bérénice Bejo, The Artist; Jessica Chastain, The Help; Melissa McCarthy, Bridesmaids; Janet McTeer, Albert Nobbs; Octavia Spencer, The Help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, let's look at the North American grosses. The top three films starring actress nominees were The Help, Bridesmaids and Dragon Tattoo, which made $170-million, $169-million and $101-million respectively (all figures U.S.). The top three films starring actor nominees were Moneyball, The Descendants and Extremely Loud, which made $75.6-million, $71-million and $29.5-million respectively. You don't even have to be able to add to see that discrepancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I looked back at the last couple of years, too. In 2010, the highest-grossing films with nominees in the acting categories were, in descending order, True Grit, The King's Speech, Black Swan and The Social Network. The first two of those had both lead actor and supporting-actress nominees – Jeff Bridges and Hailee Steinfeld, Colin Firth and Helena Bonham Carter. But in the next two, the ballerinas of Black Swan outgrossed the geeks of The Social Network $107-million to $97-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, the gap was more extreme. The top three pictures with female nominees – The Blind Side, Julie &amp; Julia and Precious – grossed $256-million, $94-million and $47.5-million, while the top three with male nominees – Up in the Air, Crazy Heart and Invictus – made $84-million, $39-million and $37-million. And please note, Up in the Air and Crazy Heart also had female nominees, so their numbers can't count exclusively for the guys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what does this mean? Well, it seems to suggest that pictures headlined by women are finding a way to be both commercially successful and lauded by their peers. Perhaps women's pictures have to try harder – to be richer, more thoughtful, more satisfying – to get made in the first place, but, in general, those are the kinds of films Oscar favours. The ones with more conversation than CGI, more relationships than gunfights, and more drama than action. Those things are the purview of films that star women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or rather, they've been ceded to women in Hollywood's relentless pursuit of its key demographic – young males. As a result, there's a more either/or feel to the films starring men. In 2011, the kinds of movies typically headlined by men were either blockbusters that get no Oscar love – such as The Hangover Part II, Fast Five and Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, which together grossed over $670-million – or they were art-house films that generated nominees, such as Warrior, My Week with Marilyn and Beginners, which together grossed about $32-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keep in mind, the vast majority of employed actors are men, and the vast majority of movies are centred around male characters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So de facto, in any given year, there should be more male performances from which to select the Oscar nominees. Yet the most often mentioned also-rans of 2011 – Michael Fassbender in Shame, Ralph Fiennes and Gerard Butler in Coriolanus, Michael Shannon in Take Shelter, Brad Pitt in The Tree of Life, and Ryan Gosling and Albert Brooks in Drive – were, again, far more art house than multiplex, both in their sensibilities and their grosses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With fewer actresses working in fewer films, in some years, the actress lists feel like Oscar is scraping the bottom of a rather shallow barrel. But not this year. This year, you could fill the lists all over again with equally worthy performances, among them Mia Wasikowska in Jane Eyre, Olivia Colman in Tyrannosaur, Shailene Woodley in The Descendants, Elizabeth Olsen in Martha Marcy May Marlene, Tilda Swinton in We Need to Talk About Kevin, Charlize Theron in Young Adult, Kirsten Dunst in Melancholia and Vera Farmiga in Higher Ground. That feels exciting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So does this: For decades, a majority of leading-actress characters appeared in stories that revolved around men. They were supportive wives, stormy girlfriends, scrappy aides and the like. This year, however, most of the actress nominees are playing the title characters: Albert Nobbs, Marilyn, the iron lady, the girl with the dragon tattoo, the bridesmaids and the help are the stars of their own stories. In fact, Bejo is the sole nominee in the 10 whose film title, The Artist, refers to her male co-star.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Digging deeper, the supporting-actress list used to be considered the place where ingenues shone, then quickly flamed out, to the point where people spoke of a supporting-actress curse. This year, only Bejo and Chastain appear to fit that bill, and only at first glance: Bejo, who is from Argentina, actually has 39 credits on the Internet Movie Database. Chastain, though a newcomer, exploded onto screens in six films this year, with many more already in the can. And McCarthy, Spencer and McTeer are character actresses of long standing, doing their most exciting work in mid-career.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So studio heads, please take note. Stop relegating so-called “women's pictures” to the bottom of your priority list. Stop being shocked or calling it an exception when good films starring women do well financially. Realize that a romance can be just as lucrative as a thriller – which was proven last weekend, when Rachel McAdams's The Vow edged out Denzel Washington's Safe House, $41-million to $40-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And please, take more chances with challenging, adult-oriented scripts starring either sex. Unless, that is, you want the bulk of your audience to see only comic-book films and sequels, and to tune out altogether on Oscar night.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's take a shot at fixing the archaic and inane regulation and distribution of alcohol in the province. No, I'm not advocating for more alcohol consumption, and yes, I think drinking any amount of alcohol and getting behind the wheel is a bad idea.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the perverse rules for liquor have to change. There is the well-publicized case of the Rio Theatre in East Vancouver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're familiar with the intersection where the theatre is located, you'll know that a pre-movie drink is not the area's primary substance-abuse problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrine Lea, who has run the theatre for 3 ½ years, fought a long, difficult battle for the right to serve liquor during live events. She finally got a liquor license – but one that prohibited her from showing movies, the bulk of the theatre's programming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So if you went to see a band at the Rio, you could have a drink. But suddenly the theatre was prohibited from showing, say, a documentary about the same band.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No more movies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not to worry. Rich Coleman, one day after Liquor was added to his Energy and Mines portfolio, swooped in with a fix. The Rio could still run movies and serve liquor at live events, providing the days and hours of service were approved in advance by the province. That's not easy to do when you run a venue that features rock-and-roll bands married to tight touring schedules, and movies whose release dates are determined by distributors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province says once the Rio sets its schedule, it can apply separately to have that schedule altered. Mr. Coleman suggests that could be as simple as an e-mail 24 or 48 hours before the event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes to the liquor regulations have had consequences elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late this week, the Vancouver International Film Centre was trying to make sense of a densely worded letter it received from the province informing management that Special Occasion Licences would no longer be granted for film or broadcast screenings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The theatre – which generally shows art films – has a permanent licence to serve beer and wine in advance of regular screenings, but groups who rent the centre for special events, operating under the so-called SOL, may be, ahem, out of luck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also confusing instructions about when and where minors may attend events at the theatre and how close they might be allowed to get to the bar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">God forbid anyone under the age of 19 should witness a parent or guardian sipping a glass of pinot gris before a festival screening of Satyricon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keep in mind, this rampant disregard for temperance is occurring two blocks away from the Granville Entertainment District, where beer-soaked club patrons regularly brawl in the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few blocks in the other direction, there are two sports arenas, where fans chug over-priced brew with little regard for the face-painted toddlers sitting beside them. I have been to one hockey game at Rogers Arena in the past decade. My only lasting impression is that we were surrounded by very drunk men who broke into red-faced screams any time a fight erupted on the ice below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the theatres and events venues, there are the restaurants whose “food primary” licences demand they not sell more liquor than food on any given night. They take this seriously, knowing inspectors could demand their cash-register tapes at any time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are the patio rules. There is the retail end, dominated by the government-owned Liquor Distribution Branches, which are, for the most part, about as sexy as they sound. One wonders what a dispensary might look like if the dream of government-controlled marijuana ever came true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, there are some private beer and wine stores – but the distribution and pricing of products is still under the control of the LDB.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this regulation is necessary, we're told, to ensure safety. However meritorious the notion of protecting the public from fans intoxicated by pinot noir, and Fellini retrospectives, there are slightly more pressing issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vancouver has the largest open drug market in the country. Drug gangs are shooting each other in the streets – and restaurants – for control of turf. Teenagers are dropping dead because of ecstasy. I have a hard time believing a drink before a movie is really the problem.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement this week that the House of Commons standing committee on government operations and estimates will study ways to give MPs more control over spending is timely and welcome. Timely, because budgetary restraint has become a byword of governments worldwide, and welcome, because, over the past 40 years, the House of Commons has steadily relinquished its control over expenditures to the point that it now functions in dereliction of its primary duty as the “power of the purse.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former Senator Lowell Murray lamented this fact in a speech in 2011 when he said the House of Commons has “allowed their most vital power, the power of the purse, to become a dead letter, their supply and estimates process an empty ritual.” Other parliamentarians have characterized the current situation to The Globe and Mail as “almost a joke” and “pathetic.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The process should be straightforward: The Crown, on the advice of the government, initiates spending and taxation programs. The government provides detailed estimates of the costs to the Commons, where they are scrutinized in committee, and then approved, reduced or rejected. When approved, the House votes on supply bills that appropriate monies from the consolidated revenue fund, and the business of government continues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would Canadians be shocked to learn that, at a time when taxpayers are more aware than ever of the catastrophic consequences of poorly managed public finances, the spending of the vast majority of federal departments is never examined at all by Parliament?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would they be shocked to know that it has been more than 10 years since the House reduced the amount of a single spending item? That the government routinely keeps vital budgetary information from MPs?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We think they would be horrified. Yet these are exactly the troubling issues the committee is, or should be, trying to rectify.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are multiple glaring obstacles preventing MPs from overseeing the public purse. For instance, when the government unveils its annual budget, usually in March, the spending estimates that accompany it have not been prepared in conjunction with the budget. This means MPs are given numbers that have no bearing on the budget and must wait months for supplementary estimates to see ones that do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there's this: Any estimates not examined by MPs are automatically “deemed” to have been approved. Since the majority of department estimates are never subject to committee oversight (even though there is nothing preventing that oversight from occurring), most go directly to the supply stage without discussion. There is no messy cross-examination of the minister or civil servants responsible for the estimates, no chance for your MP to question an expenditure and, heaven forbid, reduce the amount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a betrayal of the historic purpose of Parliament. Canada's Parliament is a child of Britain's “Westminster system,” which was in turn born out of hundreds of years of tension between English monarchs and commoners. The Crown needed money for wars, castles and the upkeep of the court; when it didn't have enough of its own, it imposed taxes. The people justifiably began demanding the right to control how the taxes were raised and spent. As early as 1295, a council representing commoners proclaimed, “What touches all should be approved by all.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Centuries of conflict and struggle have confirmed the primacy of the Commons in the Westminster system over matters of taxation and spending. In Canada, our constitution and our laws make it clear that only the House of Commons can create a tax, and only the Commons can permit tax dollars to be spent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The essential duty of your MP is to oversee the accounts of the Crown. But, thanks in part to the growth of the federal government to the point that the estimates and supply process has become onerous, and also in part to the rise of a political culture of control that centralizes power in the Prime Minister's Office and the cabinet, in financial matters your MP has been reduced to an expensive rubber stamp. When the king wants a new castle, he gets it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The solutions are as obvious as the problems: Align the budget and estimates cycles; eliminate the deeming rule; require the government to release budgetary information in a timely fashion; and give MPs the resources and time required to examine the government's vast accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that the current government was elected on a promise to bring accountability to Parliament, here is the chance to live up to that promise by returning the power of the purse to the Commons, where it rightfully belongs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When people make a living selling products, they sometimes stretch the truth to make a sale. It certainly happens in the financial industry, where people spout all kinds of nonsense to get investors to buy what they're selling. Here are nine examples of untruths told by advisers who put making the sale above what's best for clients:</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 “I have a great investing opportunity but you'll have to write a cheque to me personally.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At best, advisers who says this are trying to get you to buy in to some wacky off-the-grid investment that they are not allowed to sell through the usual channels. At worst, they're trying to steal your money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flee from an adviser who pulls this, and be sure to report him or her to the boss on your way out the door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2 “Government programs can't be counted on in your retirement planning.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The classic sales hack's line, designed to get you to invest more money. Fact: The Canada Pension Plan has been actuarially certified as sound. You're paying a good buck in CPP premiums – that's why the plan is safe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Old Age Security, the federal government has announced its intention to make changes that will keep this benefit sustainable over the long term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's worth noting that some experts believe the OAS would be affordable even if nothing were done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3 “Brains are more important than fees.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low fees are the one variable that you can control as an investor. Fund manager brilliance? In most cases, it's a marketing construct designed to justify high fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low-fee products are not an automatic buy, and neither is the lowest-cost option in any category. But anyone who suggests you ignore fees and concentrate on expertise is ignoring the basic rule that lower fees leave more for investors. In investing, you get what you don't pay for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5 “Leveraging is a great wealth builder.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For advisers, this is 100-per-cent true. Leveraging, also known as taking out a loan to buy mutual funds, is a way to turn a client who has nothing to invest into a six-figure stud who generates all kinds of fees and commissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are situations where leveraging can generate a better return than you'd get using your own money, but you can also lose more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plus, there's the stress of borrowing to buy investment products that could plunge madly in value at any time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4 “This diversified wrap product I'm selling you is better than your individual stocks.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You know those blue-chip dividend stocks you own? The ones that increase their payouts every year and have brought some welcome stability to your portfolio in the past year or so? Well, they are NOT generating any income for your adviser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This problem can be easily fixed by replacing your stocks with wrap products, which ramp up diversification by combining various types of assets. Too bad the fees are so high, and the products themselves so inconsistent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6 “I will pick the best possible investments for you.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many advisers are licensed only to sell mutual funds, so they won't suggest you invest in cheaper exchange-traded funds or directly in blue-chip, dividend-paying stocks. But that's not the only way advisers shrink the world of possible investments for their clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some also knuckle under to their firm's directive to foist certain investments on clients. Would these investments be on the firm's hot list because they're ideal for investors? No, it's because they're highly profitable and easily marketable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">7 “I'm okay with your small account.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advisers may say this because they're too nice to tell you to hit the road, or because they see you as someone who will grow richer over time. Either way, you should expect to be treated like a deadbeat relative – “Here's your mutual fund portfolio, have a nice life.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fairness, the economics of being an adviser just don't work for small accounts. In one way or another, advisers are typically paid for the work they do through fees set as a percentage of a client's assets. Small accounts mean small paydays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8 “The best investing solution for you involves insurance products.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe so, but probably not. Some advisers work exclusively with insurance products, so their recommendations to clients may include segregated funds and life insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These insurance solutions can make sense in certain situations, but they typically add two things investors should shy away from – cost and complexity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're pitched an investing plan that uses insurance products, ask for a non-insurance alternative and compare costs and benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9 “Everyone's losing money.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Current market conditions are a real test of an adviser's ability to construct a portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a strong emphasis on quality and a willingness to use bonds and guaranteed investment certificates despite low yields, investors can make money even while the markets lurch this way and that. This is a bad time to be an adviser who doesn't understand how to control risk.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta, if the Conservatives' budget can be believed, is rolling in dough. Government spending increased everywhere. Restraint was banished from the province's vocabulary; spending will be up almost 10 per cent in two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sustainability Fund was raided again: $1-billion over the past two fiscal years to help reduce the deficit. A budget surplus is forecast of almost $1-billion in 2013-2014, and more than $5-billion in 2014-2015. Amidst this cornucopia of spending, the Heritage Fund got a puny increase, further evidence of Alberta's refusal to save for the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The munificence is built on only one product: non-renewable resource revenues. This year, about 25 per cent of government revenues will come from this source; in two years, if the budget forecasts are correct, the share will be about 30 per cent. By far the biggest revenue source among the non-renewables: the oil sands (or tar sands, if you wish). Royalties from bitumen in two years will raise almost $10-billion, just a shade below revenue from personal income taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when Alberta touts its low personal and corporate tax rates, and the lack of a sales tax – the Alberta Advantage – there's only one reason: bitumen royalties, followed far behind by royalties from crude oil and natural gas, and sales of Crown land for exploration. No wonder it's the abiding purpose of the Alberta government to do nothing that the oil industry doesn't want, a position echoed by Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's good fortune and bright future contrasted with the scenarios for Ontario painted by economist Don Drummond and his fellow commissioners. Whereas Alberta's budgets balloon with royalties, Mr. Drummond warned Ontarians that “we cannot count on robust economic growth to resolve our fiscal challenge.” Alberta thinks its economy might grow at 4 per cent a year; Mr. Drummond forecasts Ontario might grow at half that rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's government will get bigger in spending and personnel; Mr. Drummond said Onta-rio's must shrink. Alberta is heading for big surpluses, Onta-rio for large deficits – $30-billion in 2017-2018, Mr. Drummond reckons, if nothing is done. Alberta has no provincial debt; Ontario's debt has reached a ratio of 35 per cent of the provincial economy and is going higher. Alberta has the highest bond rating; <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Investor Service just knocked Ontario's down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's spending per capita on government will go up; Ontario's must decline an average 2.5 per cent a year for seven years – “almost certainly unprecedented,” Mr. Drummond wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, no Ontario government will be that draconian, certainly not a minority Liberal government that has presided over years of big spending increases. Instead, Ontario will be raising more revenues from higher fees and taxes, thus widening the tax gap with Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta, with its booming economy, is attracting a greater share of skilled immigrants; Ontario is getting a higher share of family-class immigrants and refugees, meaning it'll take much longer to reach average Canadian wages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, Alberta pays into the country's equalization scheme, as Ontario did for decades. Now, Ontario receives equalization payments. The way the system works, however, means Ontario gets a small amount from Ottawa, but Ontario taxpayers are actually sending more money to Ottawa than their government gets back in payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drift of people and money to Alberta has been going on since the 1970s, but, for much of that period, Ontario held its own. With Alberta, it was the paymaster of equalization and, together, they were Canada's golden geese.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this changed in the past decade. Apart from a couple of drops in the price of oil, Alberta has boomed, whereas the hollowing out of manufacturing has stunted Ontario's prospects. Alberta will see big government spending with low tax rates; Ontario will face government spending but higher tax rates.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saturday, CNN, 8 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to the dark side of Friday Night Lights. In this documentary, CNN medical correspondent and practising neurosurgeon Sanjay Gupta examines the devastating impact of sports-related concussions in high-school and college sports. The report's sharpest focus is put on the case of Jaquan Waller, a high-school football player in Greenville, N.C., who sustained multiple concussions and died on the sidelines during a game. He was 16. Using the same deliberate manner he employs to deconstruct complex medical issues on CNN, Gupta explains the relatively new phenomenon of “second impact syndrome,” which involves a fatal swelling of the brain that occurs before a first concussion injury fully heals. He also talks to parents, coaches and medical experts trying to change the rules that seemingly foster head injuries. Although the report focuses exclusively on football – which is practically a religion in America – it's recommended viewing for Canadian hockey fans anxiously awaiting Sidney Crosby's return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Amazing Race</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunday, CBS, CTV, 8 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time to start globe-trekking on Sunday nights again. Back for its 20th edition, The Amazing Race is the reality show watched by people who normally abhor reality-TV. And by now the appeal seems fairly obvious: Viewers can experience exotic destinations all over the world – the new season breezes through Italy, Germany, Tanzania and, for the first time, Paraguay and Azerbaijan – without ever having to bother with the annoyances of air travel, customs agents, currency exchange and all those dang foreigners speaking their crazy languages. Even better, we get to watch other people suffer through the nightmares of international travel. Still hosted by the affable Phil Keoghan, the show's new season kicks off in Santa Barbara, Calif., and introduces the 11 two-person teams, which include the usual contingent of married couples, brothers and sisters and one set of twins, with each pair vying for the $1-million grand prize. In short order, everyone is whisked off to Argentina, where their first challenge requires the teams to skydive from an airplane soaring at 10,000 feet. No time to send postcards home on this journey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life's Too Short</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunday, HBO Canada, 10:30 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody can ever accuse Ricky Gervais of sensitivity in his comedy stylings. In this new mockumentary-style series, created by Gervais and long-time writing partner Stephen Merchant, he puts the spotlight on the three-foot-six actor Warwick Davis, best known for his lead role in the film Willow and for playing an Ewok in Return of the Jedi. In this instance, however, Warwick plays a fictionalized and extremely nasty version of himself. In hopes of rebooting his film career, Davis turns to Gervais and Merchant, also playing themselves, and ends up participating in a documentary series, filmed in the manner of The Office. The opener includes a bizarre cameo by Liam Neeson, who seeks Gervais and Merchant's counsel on starting a career in comedy, but mostly, Life's Too Short is a steady succession of gags regarding Davis's diminutive stature. He can't reach items on the top shelf. He tumbles out of his massive SUV. And his secretary suggests the tiny actor take on jobs too dangerous for children, like “being used as bait to catch a pedophile.” It's creepily funny.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pan Am</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunday, ABC, CTV, 10 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you've been following this period-piece drama about flight attendants navigating love, life and the friendly skies, circa 1963, buckle up for the final flight. Pan Am soared out of the gate to huge ratings last September, but the show has since lost more than two-thirds of its viewing audience, which means the odds of ABC sanctioning a second season are about as likely as airlines allowing people to start smoking on planes again. And the show's demise is a shame, really, since the story's primary fly girls, headed by Cristina Ricci as the plucky purser Maggie, were richly written characters and the storyline, like Mad Men, was set during one of the most interesting periods in recent U.S. history. In the final chapter, Maggie is pushed into a life-threatening situation by the bad-boy pilot Broyles, Colette (Karine Vanasse) finds love with a foreign prince, Laura (Margot Robbie) is drawn into an espionage ring and Amanda (Ashley Greene) frets that her fiancé will bolt from their pending nuptials.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the beginning, God got to put His feet up one day a week. There it is, in the Bible, much like a carefully negotiated labour contract: On the seventh day He rested. He's a busy deity. There are floods to push back and penitents to forgive. He needs his downtime.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But no, the God-botherers can't let him have a moment's peace. Instead, God has been run off His pins, like a suburban mom answering the endless demands of her brood. Except that it's not “Can I have a Pop Tart, please?” It's “Do you think you could send me some swing voters?” in the house of the Almighty. If I were God, I'd stop answering the phone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">God's busy days start off where you'd expect, on the basketball court and the football field, and in the vast halls where celebrities gather to thank each other, and Him. “First and foremost, I just got to thank God for this opportunity,” said Chris Brown when he won a Grammy this week, as if the supreme being had spent the past month in <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span>, piling his cart high with copies of the singer's CD F.A.M.E. while trying to forget about that little assault problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's amazing God has any time in his day, what with constantly saying, “You're welcome” to Tim Tebow, and engineering the unlikeliest success of the year, Linsanity. Jeremy Lin has graciously said that his success has “God's fingerprints” all over it, which must mean that God's giant footprint is outlined on the Toronto Raptors' backsides. He doesn't have room in his day planner to pencil in failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowhere is God's multitasking more visible than in the race for Republican nominee. One day soon, there may be a book called Are You There, God? It's Us, the GOP. Many of the current and former contenders – including Herman Cain, Michele Bachmann, and the duo of holy Ricks, Perry and Santorum – have said that God personally invited them to run. In fact, Mr. Cain said that when God called on him, he responded: “You've got the wrong man, Lord.” Mr. Cain was of course right in that case, which just proves you can't always trust the judgment of an omniscient deity over a pizza salesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bachmann felt a “tugging on her heart” when she prayed for divine guidance, and while most of us would attribute this to too many enchiladas at dinner, we don't have the congresswoman's track record. After all, in 2006, when pondering whether to seek public office, God had the answer: “He called me to run for United States Congress.” (He also told her to go to law school, and to look “hot” on his behalf, so maybe it was actually Satan on the line.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This does raise the question of how, exactly, the Lord advises his favourites that he's anointed them. Does he send St. Michael to Earth with a flaming iPad? Bang out a text with his all-powerful thumbs? At least he wouldn't have to worry about roaming charges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of Mr. Santorum, who is apparently God's No. 1 BFF, the answer came in prayer – or, more specifically, his wife's prayer seeking guidance. The former Pennsylvania senator rarely misses a chance to name-check the big man upstairs, whether it's on the subject of birth control or babies born through rape – they are “a gift from God,” apparently. Mr. Santorum seems to think that he, in particular, treads the path of righteousness, as if he has a direct line to God's cellphone while everyone else has to make do with the office number.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oddly, though, he doesn't seem to like piety in others: During one of the Republican debates, asked why it was wrong for Iran to have nuclear capabilities, he said: “They're a theocracy that has deeply embedded beliefs that the afterlife is better than this life.” Because, of course, no Christian would ever think that the afterlife was preferable to this one. This week, Mr. Santorum, the great critic of theocracies, announced that “America belongs to God.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have no problem with people who genuinely speak to God – mystics, visionaries and my mother, who was once told by the Holy Spirit that she had forgotten to buy butter (true story). Actually, that seems one of the few reasonable uses for a chatty deity: reminding you about your shopping list or tapping you on the shoulder when you're engrossed in a book and about to miss your bus stop. But choosing a political candidate? The poor thing's got real work to do. And games to win.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I only said they were ‘with child pornographers,' ” Mr. Toews might mumble under his breath, kicking the carpet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So, what, they're undercover cops, Vic? Or the child pornographers owe them money and they're just over there asking them to give it back? Is that how we're going to spin this, Vic? No, I don't think that will work, Mr. Minister of Public Safety. You as good as called anyone opposed to Bill C-30 – a piece of legislation that will compel Internet service providers to spend lots of money so that police agencies can force them to spy on their customers, without anyone ever obtaining a warrant – a pedophile, and if there's one thing people hate, it's being called a … ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hands fly up, a voice calls out, “Oh, I know! I know! A Nazi, sir! They hate being called a Nazi?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Yes, yes, they hate being called Nazis.” Mr. Harper takes a sweetie out of a box on his desk and tosses it over to MP Larry Miller. “But they also hate it when you call them pedophiles. Didn't your mothers teach you that? Don't call people pedophiles? It's not even a slang thing, as in, ‘How's it hangin', you old pedophile, you?' or ‘What up, you disgusting child predator?' Even pedophiles don't call each other pedophiles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Do we need to go on a field trip? Do I have to take you out to a local bar, perhaps, where one of you can call out, ‘A round for all the pedophiles in the house!' and then watch what happens? Come away from the door, Mr. Fantino. The question was rhetorical.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Don't you mean ‘developmentally disabled,' sir?” an eager, anxious young backbencher suggests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“No, I said ‘rhetorical,' not. … Oh, never mind,” the Prime Minister says. “Good – good that you are paying attention.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Right now,” he goes on, “you, Minister Toews, have achieved something very rare on the Internet: There's consensus in the comment sections. Left, right, in every paper, in both official languages, everyone hates you. You're the un-Lin. They're all in the comments right now practically holding hands, swaying, singing Imagine, and thumbs-upping each other in a giddy, almost-sexual frenzy of agreement. … Oh dear, someone get Mr. Trost a chair, and his smelling salts. Sorry, Brad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's a legend that when everyone on the Internet agrees with each other, it'll explode. Then how are we going to spy on people? And – give me the yo-yo, Tony; put down that phone, Mr. McKay, you're walking home – of course, anyone, and there were few to begin with, who was prepared to believe that we could be trusted with the unprecedented access to their personal information that Bill C-30 will give us – because they figured, you know, Conservatives aren't crazy, or paranoid about what Canadians are up to – is now reconsidering that position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So, let's try this again, what are we going to call our opponents that's not excessive?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Nazis!” someone calls out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Pedophiles!” seven or eight more people call out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“No, no, ‘Nazi' and ‘pedophile' are the bad words, remember?” our Prime Minister says, patiently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another backbencher sticks up his hand: “Maybe if we defended our ideas on their merits and didn't call the other side any kind of name … ?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sudden collective gasp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You know what to do,” Mr. Harper says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sheepishly, the backbencher goes to stand in the Loser Corner. Mr. Harper looks sad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When are the pandas coming, sir?” the Right Honourable Member for Nipissing-Timiskaming asks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Pandas! Pandas! Pandas!” Everyone cries out. “Sir, if the pandas make a baby, can we keep it?” someone asks excitedly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our Prime Minister allows himself a small smile. “Will you walk it?” he asks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Yes! Yes! Every day! Right after Question Period.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And what will you call it?” he asks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Hitl …”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Ah, ah,” Mr. Harper says, wagging his finger, still smiling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Panda Bear!” Minister John Baird cries out above the fray.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Oh, all right then,” our Prime Minister says. “You can keep it.”</p>

The computer laconically prefers 24.Rf1-f7 Qb5-b1+ 25.Rf7-f1 Qb1-b5, with a draw, as the best continuation.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TTC's Gary Webster is the straightest of straight arrows, a dedicated career public servant who sees his job as giving the best possible advice to city council and the mayor about Toronto's transit needs. Now he is on the verge of being fired for doing just that.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Webster's apparent crime is failing to be the Fords' parrot and echo their transit refrain: “People want subways.” Instead of telling them what they want to hear, he told them what he, as a professional with 35 years of service at the TTC, thinks is right. So, off with his head.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It sends a terrible message to the senior civil servants who keep the city running. “We hire them to be competent, to give us the best advice,” Councillor Joe Mihevc said in a broadcast interview on Friday, “and today the mayor, through this action, is saying ‘No, we don't hire you to give the best advice. We hire you to follow what I think.'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Councillor Adam Vaughan, for his part, described Mr. Webster as the least political TTC chief he has seen, and called the threat to fire him “disgraceful.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is hard to find a milder word. The threat shows the mayor at his worst, as a closed-minded bully who views anyone who expresses a contrary view as some kind of traitor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mayor and his circle have been gunning for the TTC and its chief for some time. Mayor Rob Ford's one-time chief of staff Nick Kouvalis, still a Ford pal, has aimed a steady stream of online gibes at Mr. Webster and the transit commission. “Is this guy for real?” he said on Twitter when the TTC head spoke his mind at a special city council meeting last week. “Get with the program or retire already.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug Ford himself told The Globe that the TTC needs “a complete enema.” When Mr. Webster tried to talk about the St. Clair streetcar project at the special meeting, an angry councillor Ford burst out. “I'm hearing a lot of excuses right now.” St. Clair, he said, “was a total disaster for the TTC.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Webster does not deserve that kind of treatment. A precise, gentlemanly fellow, he is always patient and unflappable at city council when councillors try to score points while questioning him. With Mr. Webster, there is no spin, just the facts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What really angers the Fords is that the facts in this case are against them. Mr. Webster is merely the messenger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the special meeting, he had the temerity to say that, based on all the information in front of him, he backs a plan to build light-rail transit on Eglinton Avenue and other corridors. That put him in the cross-hairs of Mayor Ford and his brother, who want the Eglinton line to go almost entirely underground, forcing the cost up nearly $2-billion and leaving little money for rapid-transit on other streets. Mr. Webster said that light-rail cars are “simply the wrong vehicle” for an all-underground line like the one the Fords want on Eglinton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A network of mostly above-ground light rail is simply “better value for money, yes sir,” he told a questioner. Light rail “is the predominant mode, accepted worldwide” where density does not justify costly subways, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of that was nothing short of heresy for the Fords. They have been in get-even mode ever since the special meeting went against them, ending in a city council decision to scrap the all-underground plan for Eglinton and go back to a light-rail network that would look much like the Transit City plan championed by mayor David Miller. They are mad as hell at Karen Stintz, the TTC chair who engineered the change, but can't get rid of her for now because all of council would have to go for it. So the knives are out for Mr. Webster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Successful governments can't work this way. To make good decisions, they need good, impartial information, not yes men. But yes men, apparently, are all the Fords want.</p>

The schools' only alternative would be to offer an education that offends no one, which is exactly in sync with the beliefs of all – an impossibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Supreme Court ruling that upheld Quebec's mandatory world-religions course shows why reasonable accommodation is such a fraught debate in that province. It is a debate that can only be settled in a spirit of compromise and togetherness. Rigidity perpetuates anxiety and conflict.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world-religions course, given to elementary and secondary students, is part of Quebec's change from a denominational public school system to a secular one. While the course is “aimed at fostering an understanding of several religious traditions,” it emphasizes Quebec's religious heritage of Christianity. “The historical and cultural importance of Catholicism and Protestantism will be given particular prominence.” Yet despite this balanced (or more accurately, uneven) approach, it ran up against a rigid response from some Catholic parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The parents in question did not even feel an obligation to explain how the teaching at school interfered with their ability to transmit their religious beliefs to their children. They merely raised the bogey of “moral relativism” – apparently a world in which all religions are spoken of respectfully. The Supreme Court was baffled, saying that the course was “a comprehensive presentation of various religions without forcing the children to join them.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By being in public schools, children and teens are exposed to a myriad of influences beyond the parents' ability to control. “The cognitive dissonance that results from such encounters is simply a part of living in a diverse society,” Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin wrote in a previous case, in which the court ruled that a British</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Columbia school board had acted improperly in keeping books about gay parents off its reading list for kindergarten and Grade 1 students. “It is also a part of growing up. Through such experiences, children come to realize that not all of their values are shared by others.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These parents were not seeking a true religious accommodation. They simply wanted to shut out the influences of a diverse society on their children. They wanted to go back to a Quebec, and a Canada, that no longer exists.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The War of 1812 saw the last foreign invasion on Canadian soil. Ironically, its commemoration has become a battleground in Canada. The arrival of the war's bicentennial has ushered in a national debate on its significance in both Canada and the United States, the level of government support it deserves and, of course, that 200-year-old chestnut: Who, if anyone, won?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some critics say the War of 1812 should never have been fought to begin with – a stupid war. It's generally agreed that the conflict, which returned all parties to the status quo after three years of brutal clashes, didn't gain much. But it's the wrong question to ask in considering its significance and commemoration. The fact is, it was fought, and like other wars, it had important effects on geography, people and history.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While little may have been gained, one key thing was not lost for Canadians: sovereignty from the United States. Had the American invasion been successful, Canada might be a very different place. The war also had an impact on first nations, which suffered disproportionate losses (including the promise of an independent aboriginal nation), French and English Canada, and black Canadians. And it set Canada on the path to nationhood. The war's legacy offers essential teachable moments in Canadian history and identity, to which contemporary topical debates can only add nuance and richness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may surprise critics that most Canadians and Americans would agree. The Historica-Dominion Institute's new binational poll measuring Canadian and American attitudes on the War of 1812 found that substantial majorities on both sides of the border believe the war is important to their national identity and history and that its commemoration is important.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Results also show telling national trends about our differing views and values on history. Americans place greater importance on teaching and commemorating the war's history than Canadians do, despite ranking it lower in significance compared with other historic conflicts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is it that, in Canada, despite a greater perceived importance of the War of 1812, we are still less likely to value its commemoration? Is it the fear that unfettered flag waving and the celebration of war is the type of nationalistic fervour attributed to our southern neighbour?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The preoccupation with avoiding American-style nationalism (for better or worse) is a symptom of a larger reluctance to promote and commemorate our history in Canada, which likely correlates to low knowledge and history education. For instance, fewer Canadians than Americans think the War of 1812 should be mandatory teaching, and 20 per cent fewer Canadians say they learned about the war in school. Telling our history is a subject on which we know our own strength (or weakness): a majority of Americans (58 per cent) and a minority of Canadians (49 per cent) agree their nation is good at promoting its history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What it means to promote history may be part of the problem. There are, of course, many ways to promote history that don't include unbridled nationalism or glossing over historical complexities beyond what Globe columnist Jeffrey Simpson calls “cardboard history” or “good guys against bad guys.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also a distinction to be made between celebration and commemoration. Whereas celebration might include the kind of chest-thumping from which Canadians typically recoil, commemoration really implies the recognition of significance. The War of 1812 can hold significance despite debate over who won (a topic 6 per cent more important to Americans than Canadians) or its relative historical importance compared with other wars. This war need not have had the same scale or significance as the Second World War to merit commemoration, nor is a real comparison even possible given the historical context.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As we approach a host of historical anniversaries – culminating in Canada's 150th birthday – we need to carefully consider what it means to us as Canadians to celebrate and commemorate our history so that these teachable moments not be lost for the sake of moral superiority.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Call it the Charest paradox. Even though the Quebec Premier has never been much loved throughout his 14 years as head of the provincial Liberal Party, and even though a huge proportion of Quebeckers are dissatisfied with his government, Jean Charest still has a fair chance to be re-elected for a fourth mandate when he decides to hold an election – maybe in the spring.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is due to two reasons: an unusual resilience that allows him to pass through the worst political storms with a kind of placid stoicism and Zen-like attitude, and the ineptitude of the opposition parties that will allow the Liberals to occupy the middle ground between an increasingly leftist Parti Québécois and the right-wing Coalition Avenir Québec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, the PQ was poised to win the next election. Instead of quietly following the course toward a probable victory, party militants went through a six-month period of nasty infighting, prompted by the shock of seeing their sovereigntist brothers of the Bloc Québécois trounced in the federal election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six MNAs broke with the party amid loud complaints that leader Pauline Marois wasn't high enough in the polls and wasn't pushing hard enough for sovereignty. Some prominent party activists plotted a putsch against Ms. Marois for the benefit of Gilles Duceppe, while some others lugubriously announced the coming death of the party – a very public show of pessimism and internal division that made the PQ look immature and irresponsible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, under pressure from her militants, Ms. Marois started moving the party to the left. She proposed a stiff tax hike on capital gains, a freeze of university tuition fees (already the lowest in Canada) and a strengthening of the language laws, including a measure that would forbid immigrants and francophones to enroll in anglophone CEGEPs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the PQ seriously considered an alliance with Québec Solidaire, a small left-wing party organically linked to the Quebec Communist Party and some extreme leftist organizations. Although the idea of an alliance has been shelved by Ms. Marois, it's still floating in the air, giving precious ammunition to Mr. Charest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new Coalition Avenir Québec, meanwhile, is positioning itself squarely on the right. Its leader, François Legault, intends to reopen collective agreements in the public sector to radically change the working conditions of, among others, teachers and general practitioners, and to introduce business-like ways of measuring “productivity.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Legault's previously good standing in the polls has sharply declined since he launched the CAQ. The party has had no convention yet and, incredibly, it's a lawyer from the law firm <span class="companylink">Heenan Blaikie</span> who's writing the platform. Mr. Legault, who wanted to form a big coalition of sovereigntists and federalists, hasn't been able to attract a single federalist as a candidate, nor has he been able to profit from the PQ's disarray.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this leaves Mr. Charest's Liberals comfortably sitting in the middle ground, where elections are won. His troops have remained loyal throughout the bad times, and the public outcry over scandals in the construction industry has abated, now that the Premier has finally set up a commission of inquiry. It will take months before it starts revealing damaging facts, so Mr. Charest has plenty of time to call an election – and maybe win at least a minority government. But, of course, anything could happen, given the extreme volatility of the electorate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dark side of the moon is apparently the perfect place for radio astronomy. On Earth, low frequencies are absorbed in the atmosphere and high frequencies are lost in the babble of a cluttered environment. Lacking an atmosphere and shielded from Earth's noise, the long lunar night (about 350 hours) is ideal for detecting NEOs (Near-Earth Objects) – things that could threaten Earth with cataclysmic destruction. Unfortunately, these nefarious things can't be easily detected either from low-Earth orbit or from Earth itself.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lunar perspective on things makes the moon an ideal outpost for analyzing solar weather – and for many other pure-science assignments as well. In 2006, more than 1,000 scientists collaborated on NASA's celebrated “list of things to do on the moon” – and came up with 180 scientific objectives that require a permanent off-Earth observation platform: tracking the health of Earth's oceans, measuring climate change in real time, developing advances in lunar technology, making breakthroughs in terrestrial medicines, detecting volcanic eruptions on Earth before they occur. And mundane things, too: preparing the moon for lunar tourists, and planting (hydroponic) lunar gardens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can make a good case, in other words, for a permanent human colony on the moon – as Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich did when he visited Florida's Space Coast in January. “By the end of my second term,” Mr. Gingrich proclaimed to thunderous applause, “we will have the first permanent base on the moon, and it will be American.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, Mr. Gingrich found himself fiercely criticized and rudely ridiculed. Mitt Romney, his Republican protagonist, said he should be “fired” for making such a frivolous commitment in hard times. Comedian David Letterman said Mr. Gingrich was proposing to spend billions of dollars “to study the effect of gravity on double chins.” All in all, Mr. Gingrich induced a remarkably dismissive, and distinctly anti-intellectual, response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, George W. Bush beat Mr. Gingrich to a moon-colony assignment by eight years – announcing his own commitment in 2004. Mr. Bush instructed NASA to establish a permanent human presence on the moon by 2020 – and pursue a longer-term objective of manned flights to Mars. In 2005, with $100-billion in up-front funding, NASA undertook to develop a next-generation spaceship to deliver 20 million tons of equipment to the moon by 2015 and to construct “a habitable lunar outpost” by 2020. This mission remained NASA policy until Barack Obama abruptly cancelled it, along with many of the country's other space objectives, in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps Mr. Gingrich ticked people off by the heroic manner of his pronouncement. He made no reference to Mr. Bush – which good manners required. But he did advance two novel amendments to Bush space doctrine. In the first, he proposed that the U.S. grant statehood to the lunar colony when it reached a population of 13,000. In the second, he proposed that huge money prizes be given to scientists or engineers who devised technology that helps a lunar colony get started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a bit early to think of statehood, which implies two Senate seats for the moon colony. And it's not necessary. An American flag will suffice for military concerns – and that will inevitably influence any lunar adventure. As it should. In space, as on Earth, military advantage goes to the country that holds the high ground – and the moon is high ground by anyone's standard. The prize money, though, is a good idea. As Mr. Gingrich noted, Charles Lindberg flew across the Atlantic in pursuit of a $25,000 prize. And Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic in exchange for 10 per cent of the profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama quite properly delegated a key private-sector role to the country's emerging space-flight industry. (In 2010, California-based <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corp</span>. became the first private business to put a spacecraft into orbit.) But the President's space program is a messy, down-sized affair. (NASA must now hitch rides on Russian Soyuz rockets.) In his State of the Union speech, Mr. Obama didn't mention space – not as science or as industry or as adventure. From the American perspective, call space the Lost Frontier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. will return to space, partly because it must, partly because it should. There are 180 important things to do on the moon – for the sake of a country, yes; but for the sake of a species, too.</p>

Here's the latest utterance from the Philadelphia Flyers goaltender after his latest pratfall,a 6-4 loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins last Saturday: “I will continue to work on this … but I will try to find peace in my soul to play in this city.” I'm sure the Philly fans understand.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MAPLE LEAFS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which Jacket fits best?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the trade talk has been about Nash. But for the Leafs, Carter might be the better choice if they're going to make a deal with Columbus</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Word that Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Brian Burke met with his Columbus Blue Jackets counterpart on Sunday morning sent the predictable frenzy through the social media, with Burke staying mum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">”No comment on any … potential deals,” Burke said in a terse e-mail message.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The excitement was all about Blue Jackets winger Rick Nash, the top prize as the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> trade deadline nears, but chances are Burke and Jackets GM Scott Howson spent just as much time talking about centre Jeff Carter. Burke's chances of making a deal for Carter, a player he has coveted in the past, are far better than his chances of landing Nash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, Burke has some decent assets, such as defenceman Luke Schenn and forwards Nazem Kadri or Joe Colborne, to offer Howson for Nash but other teams can top that. Second, if Burke were to decide to throw almost every decent prospect he has plus some draft picks on the pile in order to get Nash, what good would it do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Leafs showed during their western road trip last week that they are miles away from being a contender. Just about every part of their game has weaknesses and now it looks as if they have to start all over again in trying to find a goaltender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Burke also said in that e-mail message, “We are not looking for a goaltender at this point.” That could be because none are available at a decent price and Burke wisely thinks it's better to wait until summer to plug this gaping chasm. Youngsters such as Jhonas Enroth or Anders Lindback plus any young goaltender who wasn't included in a Nash trade might be available then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The No. 1 issue with a young team is often confidence. The Leafs' shoddy goaltending is doing nothing in this regard, which makes it a critical issue to address before next season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any event, the Leafs are at a point where trading for Nash doesn't make much sense. They are still a team on the rise despite their troubles. But they are not one or two players away from winning the Stanley Cup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his nine <span class="companylink">NHL</span> seasons, Nash has shown he is a good player with gusts to great but not someone you build a team around. Nevertheless, Howson and his senior adviser Craig Patrick, who may be making the real decision on this trade, are looking for a superstar's price. Plus, Nash carries a Steve Yzerman-like contract with a cap hit of $7.8-million (all currency U.S.) for the next six seasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only way a Nash trade makes sense for the Leafs is if the teams with the best assets, such as the Los Angeles Kings, melt away and Howson and Patrick somehow decide to deal him for something less because the marriage is on the rocks anyway. Better that Burke take a look at Carter, since the Leafs' need is greater at centre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, this, too, needs to be done with caution. Carter also carries a hefty salary cap hit at $5.3-million for 10 seasons beyond this one and his attitude since being traded to Columbus by the Philadelphia Flyers is not encouraging. Burke also needs to decide if Carter, who is more shooter than playmaker, would be a good fit with Phil Kessel and Joffrey Lupul or with whomever winds up being the second-line wingers next season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the plus side, if you decide Carter, 27, can be one of your top two centres for more than five years, his cap hit is manageable. And the Blue Jackets are so eager to be rid of him, the price compared to Nash will be cheap. But care is needed in making the decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">********</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASH STORYLINES TO WATCH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PRICE FOR A STAR</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A young goaltender is considered to be at the top of the price list for Columbus Blue Jackets winger Rick Nash. However, word out of Columbus is that is not necessarily so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Columbus Dispatch reported Sunday that a source said Jackets general manager Scott Howson and senior adviser Craig Patrick are mainly interested in the maximum possible price. “We want value,” the source said. “Doesn't have to be that position.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is still believed Nash's preferred destinations (he has a modified no-movement contract) are the Boston Bruins, New York Rangers, San Jose Sharks, Toronto Maple Leafs and Vancouver Canucks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KINGS IN NEED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Los Angeles Kings extended their scoreless streak to 120 minutes 3 seconds thanks to a shutout loss last Saturday to the Calgary Flames. They are now the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s worst scoring team with an average of 2.07 goals a game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of which means the pressure on general manager Dean Lombardi to win the Nash sweepstakes is crushing. The way their fans see it, the Kings have to make a good playoff run or else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lombardi has the assets Howson is looking for: a young, highly-regarded goaltender in Jonathan Bernier and young defencemen such as Jack Johnson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kings are fighting with the Flames for eighth place in the Western Conference. The Flames' win Saturday put them in eighth and the tiebreakers are in their favour. That might be the tipping point for Lombardi on this deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FLYERS BULK UP</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philadelphia Flyers GM Paul Holmgren has met with Howson but it does not look as if Rick Nash is headed to Philly. The Flyers' decision to beef up their defence with two trades, acquiring Nicklas Grossman and Pavel Kubina, indicates otherwise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides, the Flyers' biggest problem right now is goaltending and they do not have the cap room to make Nash an easy fit. The trouble for Holmgren is his goaltending problem is practically impossible to fix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Ilya Bryzgalov holding a huge long-term contract, Holmgren cannot move the slumping goaltender nor can he add another one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus Holmgren took the only option he had, bringing in the best defencemen he could in hopes of protecting Bryzgalov and youngster Sergei Bobrovsky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">********</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIVE GAMES TO WATCH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caps at Hurricanes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto Maple Leafs fans should be watching this one to make sure Washington's woes continue in the playoff turtle race with their lads. Others can watch to see if the return of Caps defenceman Mike Green helps get them going. Monday, 7:30 p.m., TSN2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Devils at Maple Leafs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Devils are one of the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s hottest teams while the Leafs are one of the coldest. But the Torontonians need to snap out of it before the Capitals do. Tuesday, 7 p.m., Sportsnet Ontario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wings at Hawks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Detroit, as always, is flying high with no worries as the trade deadline approaches. Chicago, on the other hand, still has to decide if its modest two-game winning streak means its goaltending worries are over or a trade is necessary. Tuesday, 8 p.m., TSN2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kings at Avalanche</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is a chance to see just how bad the Los Angeles offence is. Then again, Colorado may not be the best team for this demonstration. And maybe the Kings will have Rick Nash by this time. Wednesday, 9 p.m., TSN2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharks at Leafs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Put the kids to bed early for this one. It's not for family entertainment. Think the poor unsuspecting swimmers on the beach and Jaws. Thursday, 7 p.m., TSN.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All times Eastern</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TEAM TO WATCH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No team is stumbling as badly as the Washington Capitals when it comes to falling flat in the face of a great opportunity. As bad as the Toronto Maple Leafs' inability to get a grip on the eighth and last playoff spot in the Eastern Conference is, the Caps' failure to seize the chance to move ahead of them is even worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alex Ovechkin is the whipping boy for the Capitals' woes, given that his production funk is now in its second season, and rightly so. But the loss of centre Nicklas Backstrom on Jan. 5 to a concussion is equally devastating. He was their best player this season and might have helped bring Ovechkin around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one knows when Backstrom will return. “Could be two weeks, could be two months, could be two years,” Caps general manager George McPhee said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With their top line ineffective, the Caps are getting little scoring support from their other three lines. However, there was one bright spot on the weekend when defenceman Mike Green, always a big part of the team's scoring, returned from a six-week injury absence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Capitals have two games left on their four-game trip, playing the Carolina Hurricanes on Monday and the Ottawa Senators on Wednesday. They have not won two games in succession in their past 15 and need to start now.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. But what happens to the activities on an <span class="companylink">NHL</span> team charter? If a reporter on board sees the star player in a walking boot or witnesses the coach and goalie in animated conversation, can the reporters go with the story? And is it true, in the words of Alexei Kovalev, that “when [reporters] fly with the team and go through the [metal detector] at an airport, their bags are filled with beer”?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We canvassed five Canadian NHL clubs about their policy (Toronto and Ottawa did not respond) regarding journalists' ability to disseminate what they see in the air and on the tarmac. The Canucks, Jets and Flames all told us that they expect “a level of confidentiality” from media in return for the privilege of flying with the team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have no written rules, but an understanding the plane is an extension of the locker room and what goes on there is private,” e-mailed Scott Brown, senior director of communications for the Jets. “They are provided a courtesy of being allowed on the plane in order to make travel more convenient for them and they are asked to extend us some courtesy in return.” Brown added that if there is a newsworthy event, the team and three media members who regularly use the charter can “agree on a time when they can report that, and they are given some lead time when compared to other media.” In other words, timing is managed by the club. Which is understandable on its own plane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is less of a problem now as very few media members still fly on team charters. Some reporters prefer the extra work time they don't get with the prompt departures of teams after games. Others prefer not to accept the control exerted by teams over what may or may not be reported. Most media members on team charters are either working for TV, radio broadcasters or those working on the club's website – many subject to hiring approval by the team</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's important for fans to understand the distinction. For complete candour, it's hard to fly with the team a reporter covers. As for beer, reporters are entitled to share in food and drink aboard team charters, but abuse of the privilege is, according to our sources, rare to non-existent. Especially with police on alert for drunk-driving incidents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Like Dinner</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TSN Radio 1050 has bowed to reality and shunted The Dan Patrick Show from its 9 a.m. to noon slot into the netherlands of nighttime. Patrick has an excellent show, but when the U.S. sports wheel turns to college hoops and NBA at this time of the year, TSN could broadcast Hinterland Who's Who and get better ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick simply doesn't talk enough hockey to satisfy Leaf Nation's mania for all things Carl Gunnarson. And so the decision to plug the time slot for now with someone who knows Dion Phaneuf from Dionne Warwick. The fact that TSN has assigned journeyman Scott MacArthur to the slot says it hasn't made any firm decision on the future of the time slot. Or else it takes a very liberal interpretation of its slogan “The Hockey Experts.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which leads us to wonder about the Fan's new afternoon duo of Tim (Micallef) and Sid (Seixeiro), who are doing their own version of Wayne's World from 1-4 p.m. on the station. (Call us crazy but it has its charms.) The former Score TV duo skew younger than any other hosts on the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If so, the Fan should put them in a higher-profile slot to exploit their appeal to a new cohort of listeners. Plus, the advertising revenues of the early afternoon shift hardly justify keeping two well-compensated hosts in that slot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As McCown is not going anywhere soon, that leaves the morning drive slot, the other big-revenue slot on the schedule. Greg Brady and Jim Lang are doing fine with the Fan's traditional constituency but Richards is grabbing the youth vote. If the Fan wants to fight Richards for the younger listeners, Sid 'n Tim might be the answer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a new, underpublicized statistic in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> this season and it can be found in the expanded standings page on the league's website, listed just after points. Its acronym is ROW – regulation and overtime wins – and it represents the playoff tiebreaker adopted for this season after general managers recommended the change last March.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, if two teams finished the regular season with the same number of points, the playoff spot went to the team with the most overall wins. This year, shootout wins have been eliminated from the equation; they no longer count in the playoff tiebreaker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It matters to four of the seven Canadian-based teams, all hovering at the edge of playoff contention – the Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs and Winnipeg Jets in the East, and the Calgary Flames in the West. Going into Sunday games, Ottawa, Toronto and Winnipeg were seventh, eighth and 10th, respectively, in the conference standings. The team between, the Washington Capitals, led them all in regulation and overtime wins with 28. Toronto was next with 26, Ottawa had 25 and Winnipeg 24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the West, the news is better for the Flames, who found themselves holding down a playoff spot in the Western Conference for the first time in 11 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technically, they were tied in points with the Los Angeles Kings, but the Flames hold the first tiebreaker – most ROWs, 25, compared to 23 for the Kings – so if the playoffs started today, Calgary would be in and L.A. would be out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There wasn't a lot of celebrating this important breakthrough in the Calgary dressing room because there are almost two months to go in the season, but for a team that has spent the entire year chasing a playoff spot from behind, it mattered a little.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Team captain Jarome Iginla had the right perspective – happy enough that they were in the thick of the hunt, aware that last year's second-half surge got them all the way to fifth place at one point, only to fade in the final three weeks and miss out on playoffs altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the weekend, the Flames eked out a 1-0 win over the Kings in L.A, a team that cannot buy a goal right now. The Kings have been shut out in consecutive games, have sunk deeper into 30th place in overall scoring, and are hearing that Rick Nash siren song growing louder and louder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Against Calgary, the Kings were foiled by goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff, who is on an exceptional roll for the Flames.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What can I say? We love our goaltender,” said Mike Cammalleri, the former King playing centre for Calgary at the moment because the Flames have five regular forwards (Curtis Glencross, David Moss, Lee Stempniak, Blair Jones and Mikael Backlund) on the injury list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary rode Kiprusoff's goaltending to the Stanley Cup final in 2004, a year in which he was honoured with the Vézina Trophy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Iginla, Kiprusoff is in the midst of an even better all-round season this year, and it would be hard to find anyone on the L.A. side prepared to offer a rebuttal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goaltenders can be scary difference makers in the playoffs, which is one reason that a lot of opposing teams would just as soon see Calgary on the sidelines when the postseason begins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kiprusoff is a wild card who can tilt the playing field in any best-of-seven series.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He's played as good as I've seen him play, and that's counting the Vézina year,” Iginla said Saturday night. “All year he's been outstanding, and he's enjoying it, too. He likes this, climbing back up in the playoff race. He's into it, too. You can see, each game is tight and he doesn't mind that. He loves to compete.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iginla tends to avoid hyperbole, just one of the things that makes him a good captain. But he can do the math and he knew how important Saturday's victory was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you don't win,” Iginla said, “you're looking at the standings and you're four out and so it's like, you get close, and then you get knocked back. So it feels good to get to the start of where we want to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But it also feels like we're going in the right direction. It feels like we're getting better as a team, and more confident. Last year, we got into this position, but we weren't able to beat the teams with above .500 records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This year, we've been able to do that and we want to keep that going. Our goal is to make the playoffs and then build on that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And maybe they can, too, just so long as they keep those ROWs coming.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE QUESTION</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm training for a 10-kilometre race. Every week I run one three-km run, three five-km runs and one long run that progressively increases from six to 12 km. All of my runs are at the same pace. Am I missing anything?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ANSWER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Replace the three-km run with a weight workout and make sure that you stretch after each run. Focus on strengthening your lower body and core. Strength training and stretching will help prevent running related muscular imbalances and injuries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vary your speed and elevation. Instead of doing one of the five-km runs each week, alternate between doing hills or speed work. Do the workouts described below in alternate weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hills: Locate a hill that is approximately one km away. Run to the hill and up it quickly, then walk back down. Start with three hill repeats and work up to six. Finish by jogging back to your starting location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speed: Run for one to two km to warm up. Then do two to four sets of half kilometres at 10 to 40 seconds faster than your ideal 10K race speed. Walk or jog for one to two minutes between intervals. Run one to two km to cool down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the race gets closer, consider increasing the distance of one of your easy five-km runs. Progressively increase the distance from 5.5 km to seven km.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Make sure you “taper” in the week leading up to your race. Decrease your training volume to three three-to-five-km runs the week before the race. This will allow your body to rest and help you perform at your best on race day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trainer's Tip</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My personal favourite taper-week run is a five-km run at moderate pace that includes five to eight “pick-ups.” To do a pick-up, increase your speed for 20 seconds, and then run normally for two minutes. These small speed increases will remind the body what it feels like to run quickly during the low-intensity week.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ruling last week by Andrew Scheer, the Speaker of the House, to allow MPs to bring infant children into the Commons under certain circumstances is a wise and evenhanded one, and sends the right message to Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scheer was caught off guard this month when an NDP MP, Sana Hassainia, brought her three-month-old son into the House in advance of an important vote.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The baby's presence caused what Mr. Scheer considered to be an unacceptable disturbance when other MPs began taking pictures, a violation of a rule banning cameras from the chamber. The Speaker sent a page over to ask that the cameras be put away, but somehow Ms. Hassainia was led to think she was being asked to leave because of her child.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scheer insists it was never his intention to throw Ms. Hassainia out of the House, and everyone is inclined to believe him. The result of this misunderstanding is some clarity on the issue. Mr. Scheer has ruled that infants are welcome in the chamber, as long as they don't cause a disturbance and are there because their mother or (less likely) father has been called to an emergency vote or because a pre-existing childcare arrangement has fallen through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hassainia is luckier than many mothers of newborns. She has a well-paying job, a husband to share the load and, now, a workplace that is understanding of the fact that being a working mother requires flexibility from employers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many mothers, a call to come to work unexpectedly or a breakdown in daycare plans can result in a scramble to find backup, sometimes at great cost and always at great inconvenience. In the worst circumstances, the inability to find a last-minute childcare solution could put their employment in jeopardy. Mr. Scheer's ruling is a clear demonstration that, even in the most august settings, mothers must always be able to bring their babies to work with them when emergencies arise. It is not a legal precedent, but it is certainly a moral one.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To understand the presidency of William Jefferson “Bill” Clinton I think you have to acknowledge that he was the first and only rock ‘n' roll president of the United States.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not simply because he played the sax, but because of what he embodied as a man of his place and of his time. His presidency embodied rock ‘n' roll the way culture critic Greil Marcus defined the music – “rock ‘n' roll not as youth culture, or counterculture, but simply as American culture.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Put Clinton in that context and the elasticity of his persona and politics are explained. He was sinner, saint, liar, hero, simultaneously an Everyman and aloof. He was fleet of mind and flawed, intellectually smart, yet ill-disciplined. He expected to be forgiven, as all great rock ‘n' roll artists do, because of the immensity of the solace they deliver, not judged on personal weakness and messes created.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exhaustive, four-hour documentary special Clinton (PBS, 9 p.m. on American Experience) doesn't treat Clinton as a rock ‘n' roll figure. It barely notes the cultural stew from which he emerged – the Arkansas of Ronnie Hawkins, Johnny Cash and Floyd Cramer. Or the age group he defined – the first president of the baby boomer generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It does, however, open with a situation that lasted mere moments in his presidency, moments unfolding on Dec. 11, 1998. Clinton said, “I am profoundly sorry for all I have done wrong in words and deeds.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was his apology for misleading so many people over his relations with Monica Lewinsky. The apology anchors the documentary (continuing Tuesday, 9 p.m.) and haunts it. It's a clue. Clinton was a sinner. If you're rock ‘n' roll, you understand a sinner and forgive. If you're not, you don't get it and you never will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon in the doc, somebody suggests that Clinton was so clever, so at ease with politics and power that he created circumstances that would act as barriers he must overcome. It sounds dubious. The guy was a force of nature as president, unique. He stands apart from those who came before and came after him as president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The doc is as engrossing as it is exhaustive. Part of its impact is the contrast between the Clinton years and now. It's not just that we see Clinton with Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show in 1988. The 1990s seem very distant. It is astonishing to be reminded that most of the Clinton years did not have the ceaseless babble of the Internet and histrionic 24-hour TV news. It is at the end of the Clinton years that we get a glimpse of the future. While the mainstream press was leery of the rumour about Clinton's relations with Lewinsky, the online Drudge Report went full bore on the story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As his career is covered here, there was a distinct pattern. He's clever and charming and gets into scrapes from which he must recover. But recover he does. And many people believed him because, if he was a rascal, that made him human and plausible. “I'll be there for you till the last dog dies,” we hear him declaring on the campaign trail in 1992. It's an odd phrase, but it worked, because it's rock ‘n' roll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Arkansas, we are told, his youth and arrogance derailed his political career as he failed to win re-election as governor and, as many cronies recount, he spent two years asking everyone, “What did I do wrong?” Nobody says it, but he was like a singer, a pop artist of some kind, entangled with his fan base, trying to figure out a way forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We get background. It was Hillary's fierce drive and ability that saved him, intellectually. The naiveté of his early presidency. Former adviser David Gergen says, “The harder reality was that he won with 43 per cent of the vote in a three-man race. And that's not exactly a heavy mandate.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second night of Clinton opens in 1995 with a “chastened” Clinton struggling to come to grips with a presidential agenda. The show takes us through the ups and downs. The Oklahoma bombing. The war in Bosnia. The extraordinary and still mystifying Whitewater investigation. But it is the Lewinsky affair that looms, always.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Reich, secretary of labour under Clinton says, “Maybe Bill Clinton, who so much needed and wanted to be loved, just couldn't say no to someone who wanted affection and gave him back affection.” Tellingly, this puts Clinton in the context of artist and performer, not politician.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're told about the livid hatred of Clinton that lurked in establishment Washington, all whipped into a frenzy in the exposure of the Lewinsky affair. But why the hate? That isn't explained. One can only guess and I'd guess at that old American tension and loathing between politics and the popular culture. Washington was politics, old school. Clinton was Elvis and all that Elvis typified – hillbilly, rockabilly, raw religion and rage at constraint, the worship of feeling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final hour, with its detailed account of the end of the Lewinsky mess, is fascinating. The tsunami of outrage. The hurt. All of it epic and dumb, like a rock ‘n' roll song.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clinton is a fine four hours of television, but it sure could use more music to make any sense of its subject.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was show time for toy dogs on the green carpet inside Ring 7 at Madison Square Garden in New York. The Westminster Kennel Club was conducting its 136th annual dog show, which it describes as a combination Super Bowl and Academy Awards for “canine athletes.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A six-year-old female Havanese named Mistytrails Double Stuf'D Oreo, or Reo for short, was presented by the high-schooler. The dog had travelled from Cobble Hill to Manhattan, where she shared a bed in a room in the New Yorker Hotel. The art deco wonder made available grooming stations, treadmills and indoor potty areas covered by synthetic grass for its four-legged guests.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dogs, too, looked their best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Havanese, a toy breed known for a gentle disposition and kewpie-doll cuddliness, were rated by Sari Brewster Tietjen, of Rhineback, N.Y., a stern-faced adjudicator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking over the scene was Bev Dorma, a long-time dog breeder and Emily's mother. She fretted that the appraiser was overlooking Reo, Canada's reigning female Havanese champion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, in a video of the judging posted by the kennel club, the judge barely glances at Reo, instead surveying the other little dogs with an unblinking gaze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“She had poker face on,” Ms. Dorma said. “Later you realize she was looking for her second-, third- and fourth-place winners. After her first going over and watching [the dog] move, she knew Reo was her winner.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the judge chose Reo as the show's best in breed, a decision popular with the crowd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When she pulled Reo out of the front of the line, my whole body went into this shaking, oh-my-goodness mode,” Ms. Dorma said. “Am I really seeing this? You're so overjoyed. I don't know who I was prouder of, my daughter or the dog. Both.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Question</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's better for me: coffee or tea?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that's a very good question. Studies have determined that both coffee and tea have health benefits. Provided you don't load your beverage of choice with sugar and cream, either can be a good source of certain nutrients and antioxidants linked to disease prevention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's start with tea. Fresh tea leaves are an incredibly rich source of phytochemicals called catechins, which have potent antioxidant properties. In fact, tea is one of the highest sources of antioxidants in the North American diet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to health, most of the research has focused on green tea suggesting the beverage may help lower the risk of certain cancers (breast, ovarian) and heart disease. Regular black tea drinkers have also been found to have a lower risk of developing heart disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strongest evidence for coffee's health benefits centres around diabetes. Drinking at least three cups of coffee per day has been linked to a lower risk of developing Type 2 diabetes in a number of studies. Coffee (even decaf ) contains an antioxidant called chlorogenic acid, which has been shown to dampen inflammation in the body, reduce glucose (sugar) absorption and improve how the body uses insulin, the hormone that lowers blood glucose. Coffee also contains magnesium, a mineral linked to blood sugar regulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a downside to coffee for some people: its high caffeine content. (Tea contains much less caffeine than coffee.) Drinking too much coffee can result in a high caffeine intake, which can disrupt sleep and rob calcium from bones (if you aren't getting enough calcium from foods). And some studies suggest that too much caffeine during pregnancy can increase the risk of miscarriage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women of childbearing age should limit caffeine intake to 300 milligrams per day. Other healthy adults can safely consume 400 mg daily – the equivalent of almost 2.5 cups of coffee. (One eight-ounce cup of regular filter drip coffee contains roughly 180 mg of caffeine.) One eight-ounce cup of black tea has 43 mg of caffeine and green tea contains 30 mg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And coffee, caffeinated or not, can also trigger heartburn if you suffer from reflux (GERD).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what's better for you – coffee or tea? That really depends on you. If you are not sensitive to caffeine and don't suffer heartburn, both coffee and tea are considered healthy, especially if you skip the sugar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it's antioxidants you're after, go for green tea, which contains about three times more catechins than black tea.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone who might take satisfaction in watching Ontario, once the richest province in Canada, get its comeuppance as it grapples with low growth and high debt should remember that the province's troubles are everyone's troubles. In this country, when Ontario suffers, everyone else suffers, too.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of us remember the waves of public-sector strikes and repeated civil disturbances that accompanied the Mike Harris government's efforts to eliminate a chronic deficit in the 1990s. Economist Don Drummond in his report on Ontario's current situation warns that this time “the government will have to cut program spending more deeply … and over a much longer period of time than the Harris government did.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things have gotten so bad because over the past decade the province has become two Ontarios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first Ontario is Toronto, a Canadian New York whose economy is powered by financial services, education, biosciences, cultural industries, tourism and more. Living in or near Toronto, it can feel as though things are still going reasonably well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But outside Greater Toronto is a whole lot of Ohio, as the manufacturing sector follows other Great Lakes economies into rustbelt status. This is why unemployment has been above the national average for five years, and why the last recession was far worse in Ontario than elsewhere. It is why, amazingly, average personal income has dropped below the national average. And it is why real growth of about 2 per cent annually is the most the province can expect for years to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Ontario continues to finance the social programs that many provinces depend on. Its taxpayers contribute 39 per cent of federal revenues, but receive only 34 per cent of federal spending. Each year, 2 per cent of the province's GDP, or $12.3-billion, bleeds to the rest of the country, even as Queen's Park records a deficit of $14-billion, which Mr. Drummond calls “a clear demonstration of the perverse structure of Canadian fiscal federalism.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario voters can no longer afford to finance Employment Insurance programs that favour Atlantic fishermen over laid-off auto workers. No Ontario government can tolerate equalization programs that subsidize university tuition outside the province, even as Mr. Drummond calls for annual increases to postsecondary education of no more than 1.5 per cent, less than the rate of inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voters in the Prairie and Pacific provinces may shrug and say this is an Eastern problem for the Eastern provinces to sort out. This attitude is delusional. Even the most resource-rich provinces and Ottawa, as well, face lean years as they try to balance their books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People shouldn't have any illusions,” said Craig Alexander, Mr. Drummond's successor as chief economist of the Toronto Dominion Bank. “Keeping program spending to around the pace of inflation or below is extraordinarily difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If governments actually managed to do what they have committed to do up to this point, it would be one of the longest and most painful periods of fiscal austerity the country has ever had.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this time the economic engine in the heartland won't be there to cushion the pain and take up the slack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Drummond report won't be fully implemented. At best, the McGuinty government is likely to slow the growth of the debt. It lacks the mandate, and probably the political will, to slash spending as severely as needed to balance the budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This will leave the province dangerously vulnerable to another recession, an oil shock or a sharp rise in interest rates, which could swiftly bring on a fiscal emergency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta defaulted on its debt during the Depression. In more recent times, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland came close. If any province found itself unable to service its debt, “we explicitly assume that there is a high probability that the federal government would help the province,” said Jennifer Wong, assistant vice-president at Moody's Investors Service, in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If things go badly, Ontario's problem could become everyone's problem, with a vengeance.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It had to happen sooner or later. Happiness is the new sex, after all. There are new books on how to get more of it almost every month. It's a burgeoning field of scientific study. And to not want happiness is like – yup, you guessed it – not wanting sex. It's a basic human drive.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which explains why there's a new movie about happiness that is making its way around the planet. On Saturday, Feb. 11, people in more than 600 locations in 60 countries and on seven continents, including Antarctica, got together to watch a screening of a documentary called Happy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why then? It was World Happy Day. (I didn't know, either, if that makes you feel any better.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The people behind the film came up with the idea of designating a World Happy Day to help ignite a grassroots movement for the documentary, in part by proclaiming it's a movement even before it becomes a fully fledged one. That method of distribution – through word of mouth, social media, independent theatres and a little help from Lululemon (more on that later) – came about because the documentary failed to pick up a satisfactory distribution deal even though it won awards at several small film festivals last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The offers clearly didn't see the value of the project,” says Roko Belic, the film's director. “And we couldn't put it in the hands of people who didn't understand it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh yes, this isn't just a movie. It's an evangelical mission to the people who made it. Film has always been the most accessible of media, and this documentary does an excellent job of combining bona fide scientific research with real-life stories of people who have found happiness in ways that subvert the often-unchallenged cultural script of money, car, house and holidays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can absorb all the most important happiness findings without wading through a meticulously researched book. And best of all, the viewing of a film happens in a group, which facilitates discussion afterward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Happy began six years ago with a Hollywood-scale disillusionment. Tom Shadyac, prolific comedy director of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Liar, Liar, The Nutty Professor and Bruce Almighty, among others, read an article about happiness in the The New York Times and called up his friend, Mr. Belic, an Academy-Award-nominated documentary director (Genghis Blues) to ask if he was interested in investigating the idea of well-being.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Tom understood the paradox of having lots of money and not really being happy,” says Mr. Belic on the phone from California. Both men were also puzzled by the fact that the United States – the country that has the pursuit of happiness in its constitution – ranked No. 23 in the global happiness survey cited in the newspaper article. Mr. Shadyac offered to fund a documentary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I thought it would take one year, not six, and I didn't know that it would change my life,” Mr. Belic says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the film, he interviews some of the world's happiness gurus – Daniel Gilbert, Sonja Lyubomirsky, Tim Kasser, the Dalai Lama – and travels to India, Japan, Denmark, Bhutan, Africa and parts of America to find stories of contented people. It may have become almost cliché to include someone such as the rickshaw driver in Calcutta, who lives in a tent and beams with joy, but it's hard to dismiss the stories of people who are just like you and me, only less lucky, less well-off and far happier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the many powerful stories, Melissa <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> is most compelling. Once a pretty debutante, she was run over by an SUV in Texas in 1992. Her face crushed, she endured 26 reconstructive surgeries and almost died. Her husband left her. Friends could barely look at her. In the film, she is a remarkable study in the human capacity to not just overcome adversity, but become happier because of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, organizers arranged screenings of Happy in small, independent theatres. That's how Chip Wilson, the Canadian-born founder of Lululemon, saw it and offered to help. In Toronto last year, the company invited Lululemon ambassadors – people in the retail/yoga community who embody the company's philosophy and “live the culture” – to watch the film. Talk about arming missionaries with the right kind of marketing tools. The screening of Happy in Toronto on World Happy Day was organized by Linda Malone, owner of I am Yoga and a Lululemon ambassador, who can wax poetic about the need “to create a space for serenity” for her devotees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interestingly, the film has the power to transform even those who didn't feel they were candidates for change. “I wasn't the person I was making this kind of film for,” says Mr. Belic, 40. “Things were going well in my life,” he says. “I was following my dream, being a filmmaker. And I thought I would be making the film for people who were sort of stuck in a rut, not feeling they had the right to complain but missing the buzz. But this is the only film I've ever done that has affected me so profoundly.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He moved from San Francisco to Los Angeles to be closer to friends, because he had witnessed the importance of community in the stories he filmed. And he decided to live in a trailer park near the beach so he could surf more often. “It's an amazing, supportive community,” he says. (It should also be noted that his friend and the film's backer, Mr. Shadyac, has also moved to a trailer park, having sold many of his belongings and given up his multimillion-dollar mansion. He went on to make a documentary of his own, I Am, about his journey to finding happiness.) Mr. Belic and his girlfriend also decided to have a baby, who was born 10 months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The film is non-profit and was produced by the Creative Visions Foundation, which supports activists. All proceeds go to fund the “Happy movement.” The organization is in the process of developing an educational component through a grant from George Mason University in Virginia and last week made DVDs available for sale in the U.S. and Canada through its website (thehappymovie.com).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The movement is picking up steam because people are responding to a world view that's not working,” says Mr. Belic. “The movement is not saying it's anti-capitalist and pro-socialist. It's resonating because people realize that what's in their hearts can be better represented by how we choose to construct the world.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Question</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've been seeing my family doctor for 10 years. She now has three children and is only in the office for half-days, three days a week. When I had abdominal pain, I waited one month for an appointment. The nurse practitioner did blood work and ordered a scan but did not provide results, even though I asked for them. When I call the office, I am told to see the nurse practitioner, go to emergency (usually a seven-hour wait or longer) or try the evening clinic, which is always fully booked by the time I call. I understand her wish to be with her children but feel there should be better coverage. Do you agree?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your family doctor sounds wonderful, save for the fact that she is not as available as she used to be. That's not unusual. Female physicians work fewer hours than their male counterparts – 47.5 hour weeks, compared to a 53.8-hour week – according to a study by Mark Otto Baerlocher, an interventional radiologist at Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre, who analyzed 2007 National Physician Survey figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women have made great strides in medicine. In 1980, 12.4 per cent of physicians were women; by 2010, 36.1 per cent of doctors were female, according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information. In many medical schools today, at least half of students are women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Danielle Martin, board chair of Canadian Doctors for Medicare says this trend should be seen as an opportunity for female physicians to better organize themselves into teams with other doctors and health-care workers, who can cover for each other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Doctors have a responsibility to do everything they can to make sure their patients are covered,” said Dr. Martin, a family physician at Women's College Hospital in Toronto. “Patients shouldn't think of going to emergency after 5 p.m., they should all have access to primary care. It sounds like this woman's doctor has made arrangements to cover her care.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One should expect female doctors with children to take time off to raise them, but that should not adversely affect patients. Provincial governments have spent a lot of money trying to get doctors to work in teams to provide care after hours; yours should be providing comparable care through either family doctors or other health care providers on a timely basis. It's a lot easier to do in a big city than a smaller one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've received complaints from patients who have the identical problems with male doctors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On paper, more patients have family physicians than in years past but this hasn't necessarily translated into improved access to care. Waiting a month for an appointment when you have abdominal pain is far too long; ideally, you should see a physician the same day or next day when ill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So yes, I think your physician should provide better coverage.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My grandparents emigrated from Japan to Canada early in the 20th century. Like my sisters and me, my parents were born and raised in Canada, and English was our first language. Nevertheless, I have retained a strong interest in the fate of Japan and Japanese people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For centuries, Japan maintained a feudal society by closing its doors to the world until Admiral Perry forced the country to open its ports and paved the way for the reforms initiated by the Meiji government. In a remarkably short period, Japan transformed itself into a modern Western society. After the Second World War, Japan underwent another basic shift under U.S. occupation.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both events demonstrated the incredible cohesiveness of Japanese society, a cohesiveness that underlies the ability to undergo revolutionary change without total social upheaval. Given such past experience, what will Japan's response be to the triple catastrophes of March 11, 2011?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the war was ending, my mother's parents chose to leave Canada, which had treated them like enemy aliens, and return to Japan. They were dropped off in Hiroshima, and both were dead in less than a year. For decades, I have been haunted by a question: How could the only nation to be atom bombed embrace nuclear technology so enthusiastically? It's clear this was a deliberate imposition by the United States, and in postwar Japan, whatever America wanted, Japan accepted. Fukushima confronts Japan with the reality that there is no “foolproof” technology, that nature will always out-fool our best notions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A month or so ago, I had the opportunity to travel to Japan to work on a documentary that explored the impact of the earthquake and tsunami and the national debate that followed the Fukushima nuclear meltdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nuclear technology creates electricity by boiling water so steam can drive turbines. The technology may be sophisticated, but there are other less risky solutions that, if combined with renewable energy such as wind and solar, will provide an exciting alternative. In Japan, I met some extraordinary scientists and inventors, each with an innovative solution ranging from a magnesium-driven energy cycle to new designs for tidal turbine power. But the option really driving investment was geothermal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are tens of thousands of hot springs in Japan that can provide heat and hot water. It staggers the mind to think that one of the world's most seismically active nations chose to disregard such sustainable gifts as geothermal, wind, sun and tide and invest so massively – and uncritically – in the “nuclear option.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shock of 3/11 was so intense that many Japanese are talking about a mindset shift. Everywhere, there's evidence they're starting to rethink their relationship not only with energy but with modern life's high-consumption ways. I found lots of ideas bubbling in the grassroots, focused on sustainable communities, food and energy. And as I travelled through the area most affected by the tsunami, I was reminded of how the strength of the people – orderliness, discipline and stoicism – is at times undermined by a reluctance to rise up and demand change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, few Japanese have been willing to stand out. But this attitude has been shifting. Think of the example Japan could provide to the world if it plotted a path to a sustainable electrical grid based on local, diverse and renewable energy sources. Where will Japan go? It's too early to say, but well worth watching.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-author of Beyond the Indian Act: Restoring Aboriginal Property Rights</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conservative government has shown that it favours Enbridge's proposed Northern Gateway pipeline to carry bitumen from Alberta's oil sands to the B.C. deepwater port of Kitimat. Despite this open support, there's a risk that the Northern Gateway proposal could go the way of the Mackenzie Valley pipeline – ultimately approved in principle but held up so long it never gets built, because the market has found alternative options.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 50 first nations lie in Northern Gateway's path. Consultation with these first nations will be critical, so let's look at the legal framework.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1997 Delgamuukw case, the Supreme Court of Canada held that aboriginal title still exists across British Columbia where treaties have never been signed. That includes most of the province except for the northeast, where Treaty 8 was negotiated in 1899-1900. The court ruled that aboriginal title had not been extinguished by B.C.'s course of dealing with indigenous people, even though the government had assigned them to reserves and granted to others the lands on which they used to live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The court, however, did not designate aboriginal title to specific tracts of land; that remains to be worked out in the B.C. treaty process. The first nations, meantime, have a right to be consulted about economic development projects that might affect the value of their claims to aboriginal title. The government can't authorize trees to be cut, fish to be caught, and minerals to be dug, then say, “Okay, it's your land now.” Consultations must be full and thorough, accommodation to first nations' concerns must be made where possible, and compensation must be paid where interests are damaged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But – and this is a crucial point for Northern Gateway – first nations do not have a veto. The court was very clear in Delgamuukw that “the building of infrastructure … can justify the infringement of aboriginal title.” Consultation, accommodation, compensation? Yes. Veto? No.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treaty 8 first nations are in a situation that is different in law but similar in practical effect. They surrendered their aboriginal title, but Treaty 8 gave them the right to continue hunting, fishing and trapping on Crown land until the government took up such lands for other purposes. The Supreme Court decided in Mikisew (2005) that the government had to consult Treaty 8 nations before approving infrastructure that might affect their wildlife harvesting rights, even off reserve. Again, consultation, accommodation and compensation are involved but not a right of veto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enbridge has been discussing Northern Gateway with first nations for at least five years. It has offered them an equity stake in the pipeline plus other benefits, and has also made cash grants to some first nations to finance their participation in the consultations. Another level of consultation is now being carried out by the Northern Gateway joint review panel, appointed by the National Energy Board and the Minister of the Environment to consider business and environmental issues at the same time. It will sit for almost two years and hear from thousands of intervenors, including first nations that choose to appear, and it can recommend various forms of mitigation, accommodation and compensation in its report to the federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This may sound like a lot of consultation, but the ensuing litigation is likely to be even more protracted. Although Supreme Court decisions have denied a first nations veto, they have not laid down clear criteria for assessing the adequacy of consultation. Thus the door is open for any and all first nations to seek judicial review, and that could mean a tsunami of litigation. For pipeline proponents, the risk is not so much failure to gain official approval as subsequent delays in court that might render the project uneconomic.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Writing the introduction to a collection of TV criticism for The Observer, in 1983, Clive James made wry note of the small irritations of his job.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He once spilled a tray of ice cubes in his lap when watching Barbara Woodhouse, the dog trainer, kiss a horse on TV. Another time he thinks he sprained his wrist reaching for a drink and working the remote control. Meanwhile, as he noted, other people did dangerous jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things have changed a bit since the early 1980s. These days a danger of the job is the barrage of venomous insults that can pour in. Occasionally an obsessive hater goes postal, online, and spews jibber-jabber of the toxic kind. If you pay attention, you need a thick skin. Still, writing about arts and culture doesn't qualify as dangerous when the main threat is an insult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back when I began writing for this newspaper, when a letter in the mail or a hissing voice on the phone was the main source of aggravation, there was a young man named Finbarr O'Reilly toiling in the trenches of arts reporting. Then he went away to do other things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under Fire: Journalists in Combat (CBC documentary channel, 9 p.m.) features the same O'Reilly in its opening scenes. He works for Reuters now. We see him, somewhere in West Africa, prepping to go outside and cover a war zone. “Of course you've got to take the flak jacket,” he says. Then he holds up ballistic glasses that offer some protection to his eyes, from shrapnel. “Everything has to be cotton,” he says of his clothing. He takes something fleece to stay warm at night, but is reluctant to wear it. “If there's a fire or explosion, that stuff melts into your skin. In the hospital they use a cheese grater kind of thing to remove that stuff, and you really don't want that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Directed and written by Canadian Martyn Burke, a veteran writer of novels, films and documentaries, Under Fire is chilling, saddening and very powerful. The doc (on the short list for an Oscar nomination last year) points out, at the start, that only two journalists were killed covering the First World War, 63 journalists lost their lives in the Second World War and 1,397 members of the news media have been killed in the last 15 years covering conflicts and wars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The doc deals with two issues. First, the appalling fact that the murder of journalists has become so routine that few people care, and, second, the attempts by some journalists to deal with the appalling mental toll of what they cover in war zones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We meet Finbarr O'Reilly often. At one point he's photographing the aftermath of a NATO air strike in Libya and locals are pushing him to photograph dead bodies and body parts strewn, obscenely, on the road. “I don't think I'm one of those junkies who is there for the thrill of it,” O'Reilly says. He is now taking advantage of therapy offered by psychiatrist Dr. Anthony Feinstein, who specializes in journalists suffering trauma. We see O'Reilly on the phone to Feinstein, explaining the depression that can follow a narrow escape from death and the inability to deal with normal life when at home in a peaceful place. “There's a disconnection leading to depression. This wasn't acknowledged before. It was a very macho profession,” O'Reilly says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't only male reporters who tell their stories here. Susan Ormiston of the CBC talks about the dread that comes with leaving family to go to a very dangerous place and convey its horror to the world. Christina Lamb of the London Sunday Times talks about fearing death in Afghanistan. “It just seemed really, really stupid to die in that field.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The British cameraman Jon Steele tells a truly harrowing tale of getting footage in Sarajevo during the war in the Balkans. He is still profoundly disturbed by it. And he describes his mission: “I was trying to reach through the TV screen to grab people from their comfy chairs and drag them into my camera and say, ‘Look, look, this is what it's like!'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Hedges also appears. A Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times correspondent and author of War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning, he describes himself as being, once, a “war junkie.” Hedges last appeared on our radar when he was on CBC-TV's Lang &amp; O'Leary Exchange, talking about the Occupy Wall Street movement. Kevin O'Leary famously and obnoxiously called him “a left-wing nutbar.” Which takes us back to the matter of insults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often the insults I get are rooted in allegations of partisan TV coverage of some crisis. From the vantage point of online anonymity, journalists reporting from war zones are mocked and ridiculed. But language is beggared by the images the journalists in Under Fire capture and convey. Remember that. Go ahead and insult.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a way, we owe a debt of gratitude to Vic Toews. The hapless Minister of Public Safety, who informed Canadians that they stand with child pornographers unless they support his government's electronic-snooping bill, sparked a well-deserved uproar where others have failed for so long.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law isn't new; similar bills had been tabled by previous governments, only to die when the minority governments fell. Privacy watchdogs have sounded the alarm time and again, but there was no outcry until Mr. Toews added his rhetorical fillip – that dash of George W. Bush – that turned a bit of workaday fearmongering into a grand national insult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The uproar that followed was enough to make the Conservatives blink, indicating that they're open to amending the bill – but Mr. Toews has continued to grab headlines: Nasty Twitter accounts about him, hacker threats against him, investigations and demands for more investigations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, with thanks to Mr. Toews for volunteering for pinata duty, it's time to move past the minister. Vic Toews' flying circus is a cartoonish distraction from troubling legislation. The dangers hidden in this bill are subtler than they might seem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contrary to what you might have heard, the new bill, C-30, doesn't invite police to monitor your every online move without a warrant. It does, however, require Internet companies – loosely defined – to cough up your name, Internet protocol address and a few other identifiers if the police ask for them, even without a warrant. This means that the police could conceivably collect a pseudonym you've been using to comment on websites, present it to the relevant company, and say, “Who is this person?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By trading pseudonyms for IP addresses, then IP addresses for real names and addresses, and repeating the process, police could get a pretty clear picture of what you've been up to online. (The list of exactly which identifiers police can present to Internet service providers in exchange for information has yet to be nailed down.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Investigations are going to change in character, to what we call fishing expeditions,” said Tamir Israel, a lawyer at the University of Ottawa's privacy-minded Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic, who's been following this bill's evolution for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, there is no guarantee that details uncovered in the course of this work will stay tucked away in police notebooks. For better and for worse, police do leak. Just ask Rob Ford, Toronto's beleaguered mayor, whose 911 calls wound up in the national news. One of the many uses of online anonymity is to let people in the public service raise their voices in public. Knowing that the local police force has the power to unmask anonymous commenters at will can only cause a political chill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But another part of this bill could have even further-reaching impacts. The Internet today, for all its vulnerabilities, is not really built to facilitate centralized, wiretap-style surveillance. The Tories want to change that. This bill would require Canada's ISPs to rework their systems, at considerable expense, so that just such an option exists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, actually carrying out this surveillance would require a warrant. This law is not designed to give anyone unfettered access to your online connection. But once we've rebuilt the Internet machine to feature a big, red “Spy” button that wasn't there before, we'll never be entirely sure who's using it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, a system that allows for real-time surveillance, or for the archiving and sorting of your data, would be the holy grail for criminals (and possibly the office intern), whether they're out for profit, political ends or a good time. You can't bring oil barrels full of honey to the forest and then act surprised when bears show up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Security disasters already happen with alarming regularity. The Government of Canada got hacked. <span class="companylink">Sony</span> got hacked, compromising customer data. <span class="companylink">Google</span> itself got hacked. Do you trust your ISP's security know-how more than <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, consider what could happen if other laws changed, too. Woe betide all of us if, a few years down the line, copyright infringement should become a criminal offence. (This isn't inconceivable: After all, video recording in a movie theatre already is.) If it did, these surveillance powers and tools could be turned against people who break digital locks by ripping DVDs, or download the tools to do so.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the world were actually to end in the spring of 2012, Canadians would have to wait until the game was over to hear the news that everything was over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the coming week, right up until 3 p.m. EST on Monday, Feb. 27, lunacy will rule. Television screens will be filled with grown men in dark, serious suits staring hard at their BlackBerries. Twitter will explode with speculation, errors and schoolyard fights over who was first with what news about some third-line winger no one has ever heard of before. There will be more instant analysis offered up than if the government suddenly fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to Trade Week in the National Hockey League.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It does not matter that the salary cap and competitive parity have served to make this rather anticlimactic in recent years. With few teams truly out of the playoff picture, and even fewer teams with salary elasticity, the action has been reduced largely to what Harry Sinden once called “moving-van trades” – the only winner being the companies that truck the players' furniture from the old city to the new one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commentators will, once again, overuse the phrase “traded for a bag of pucks” when they could easily use a much superior example of a lowball deal: Kris Draper from the Winnipeg Jets to the Detroit Red Wings in 1993 for a buck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk about a dollar well spent. Draper went on to play more than 1,000 games for the Red Wings, win four Stanley Cups and be awarded the Selke Trophy as the league's top defensive forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(As The Hockey News smartly pointed out last week, a puck bag sells for $24.99 and, filled with pucks, would cost $84.39 before taxes.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most speculation in recent days has concerned the destination of Rick Nash, the huge and hugely talented captain of the lowly Columbus Blue Jackets. Sadly for NHL marketing purposes, he will not be going to Nashville, having apparently lifted his no-trade clause in favour of five teams: Los Angeles Kings, New York Rangers, Boston Bruins, Toronto Maple Leafs and San Jose Sharks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keith Jones once claimed he and a journeyman teammate on the Philadelphia Flyers had their own unique no-trade clauses: “Nobody wants us.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There will be much talk, as there is each year at this time, about the 1980 trade that sent Butch Goring from the Kings to the New York Islanders, thereby giving the Islanders that final piece of the puzzle that led to four straight Stanley Cups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such genuine impact, however, is rare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is the 1964 trade between the Maple Leafs and Rangers that brought Andy Bathgate and Don McKenney to Toronto (in exchange for five players including Dick Duff) and helped produce the Leafs' second-last Cup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter how 2012 plays out, it will never compare to the trading action of 20 years ago. The Calgary Flames and the Maple Leafs launched 1992 by swapping a total of 10 players, including Doug Gilmour, in a single deal. It was also the year in which the Quebec Nordiques sent the rights to Eric Lindros to the Flyers in exchange for five fine players, including future hall-of-famer Peter Forsberg, $15-million in cash and two high draft picks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hindsight would suggest that bad trades are remembered far better than good ones, and history argues that, contrary to popular belief, not all bad hockey trades were made by the Islanders, though Zdeno Chara and the draft pick that became Jason Spezza for the Ottawa Senators' Alexei Yashin, and Roberto Luongo for a couple of middling Florida Panthers hold unique status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who can recall what the Bruins got from the Sharks for Joe Thornton in 2005?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What made the Chicago Blackhawks think the Buffalo Sabres' Stéphane Beauregard was fair exchange for unused goalie Dominik Hasek in 1992? Or the Pittsburgh Penguins sending Markus Naslund to the Vancouver Canucks for Alek Stojanov in 1996? (In the interest of fairness, it should be pointed out that Vancouver also ended up on the short end of a deal in 1986 when it took Barry Pederson from Boston in exchange for a local prospect named Cam Neely.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the experts will be quick this week to say which team won and which team lost, it's important to remember that, over time, some trades are beyond measure. Who got the better deal in 1995 when the Dallas Stars got Joe Nieuwendyk, and soon a Cup, from the Flames for an unknown prospect named Jarome Iginla? And what about that “worst deal ever” that brought Phil Kessel to Toronto for three high draft picks, one of whom turned out to be Tyler Seguin?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phil Kessel? Tyler Seguin? Kessel? Seguin? Seguin? Kessel? …</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such bar and water-cooler chatter is a waste of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this is Canada, where two dates stand out above all others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July 1, 1867, the birth of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Aug. 9, 1988, the day Wayne Gretzky was traded.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘You feel that steam heat? That's from my undercarriage.” That's the belle de jour, actress Melissa McCarthy, speaking as the disquieting Megan in the movie Bridesmaids – a role for which she has received an Academy Award nomination in the best-supporting-actress category and fame, which may be viewed as a powerful avalanche, entraining more attention each day.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's beyond fame now; she's garnering a hot, steamy, scandalous success – scandalous because of the appalling vastness of the character she plays; the dimensions of her unvarnished obscenity and blunt, shark-like appetites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McCarthy is hardly the first Rabelaisian performer by a long shot. But, sticking out very much like a sore thumb among her fellow nominees, she is the first large-and-in-charge female and blue comic to grace the uppity Oscars lists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mary Elizabeth Williams, reviewing Bridesmaids for Salon last year, called it “a triumph for vomit, and feminism” and “your first black president of female-driven comedies.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However uneasy we are with the fatuousness of that comparison, Williams correctly identified the significance of the film – and what Bridesmaids, which recently became the most popular video-on-demand of all time, means to pop, culture and to the notion of female friendship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Bridesmaids continues to captivate us (the cast will be presenters, it was recently announced, at the Oscars ceremony), McCarthy's fame grows along with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After shedding her skin as Sookie St. James on Gilmore Girls in 2007, McCarthy reappeared three years later as Molly Flynn on CBS's Mike &amp; Molly, a comedy about two morbidly obese Chicago natives who meet at an overeaters anonymous gathering and fall in love.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show was a success straight off, but it was McCarthy who drew all of the heat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, she won an Emmy for her performance on the show, and, after a charming ceremony in which all of the nominees charged the stage, a stunned McCarthy thanked everyone but Billy Gardell, the colossal Mike himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I know I'm forgetting somebody!” she whimpered, as if seeing a future unhampered by sharing a TV bed with a mountain who sleeps with a rumbling sleep-apnea mask.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McCarthy then hosted Saturday Night Live and has been cherry-picked for bigger, upcoming roles including the Knocked Up sequel, This Is Forty. Last week, she and her husband Ben Falcone got the green light from CBS on a TV pilot for their new, so-far-untitled comedy project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is McCarthy so huge? Why not, say, Kristin Wiig, who starred in Bridesmaids and is also an Oscar nominee as co-writer of its screenplay? Because McCarthy is almost insanely likable. The sophisticated actor reads, also, as if she's our funniest, wildest friend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Bridesmaids, Megan – vulgar, absurd and funny – is Wiig's character's only true friend at one point, and by the film's end all the women are exposed to be beautiful monsters: female friends, ultimately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Mike &amp; Molly, she is sharp, and bossy, but soft-spoken and kind to the near-lunatics who surround her; divested of her Megan rash and hideous sports clothes, she is a large woman who is also beautiful, something new on TV, and in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roseanne Barr was extremely overweight, but this seemed tied, ineluctably, to her Roseanne character's laziness and working-class appetites (the Connor family food was always processed junk with a side salad). And Roseanne was beautiful only to her gigantic husband, who punched a man in a bar for trash-talking his “fat wife.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Molly's weight is not even an issue on the show: She is, after all, only a third of the size of Mike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week's Valentine's Day episode featured her sharing the romantic day with Mike's partner's girlfriend due to strange circumstances; on Two and a Half Men, in the preceding slot, the men's adversarial girlfriends bonded while trapped alone during a monsoon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coincidence is notable because it speaks to the Bridemaids Effect (or the McCarthy Effect): a growing sense, on TV and in movies, of the significance of female friendship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not shop 'n' bitch, cookie-dough-binging, man-talking friendship, but friendship that cannot be defined as anything but whole and true, that runs the gamut from lascivious and coarse conversations, to sad, curt remarks, to great affection and great irritability, and to dislike, both passionate and careless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Filmed in the manner of raunchy male capers (with the requisite slo-mo walking scene), Bridesmaids does gender genre films one better and is, amazingly, a story about how women enjoy and endure each other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If roles for women are finally changing, who better to lead the charge than the unlikely heroine, Melissa McCarthy?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many long-standing institutions designed for another era, the B.C. court system wouldn't look the way it does if it was being built today.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the country's legal edicts have changed over the decades, which have had unintended consequences on the administration of justice. The rights of the accused have grown. Accordingly, so has the length of time it takes people to work their way through an ever-complex court system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wheels of justice in B.C. are now grinding under the weight of a confluence of factors: underfunding by provincial authorities, new laws that have complicated and drawn out the court process and a lack of creativity and critical thinking by those responsible for the system itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of those reasons, the last one may be the most distressing because changes that could immediately help alleviate pressure on the system need not be expensive. What they take is a new way of thinking, of setting aside historically entrenched positions and musty attitudes for the sake of the common good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Considered another way, the B.C. justice system is a $1-billion industry in which few of the 21st century business models apply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The legal system in B.C. and those across the country have mostly been resistant to change and modernization because stakeholders with vested interests have been successful in arguing that reforms driven in the name of efficiency might somehow undermine the central tenets of the system itself; the rights of the accused and the independence of the judiciary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consequently, money, and more hiring, has often been used to address problems that might have been solved more cheaply with some ingenuity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But governments are running out of money and taxpayers are running out of patience with governments that are continually asking them for more of it. So now, jurisdictions like B.C. really have no choice but to innovate and the justice system really has no choice but to co-operate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there are some early encouraging signs that this may already be happening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The B.C. Provincial Court, in concert with the attorney-general's ministry, has quietly started to redesign the court scheduling process similar to the way Alberta did a couple of years ago. (The B.C. initiative is under way in Provincial Court in Victoria.) The idea behind it is to reduce the amount of time judges are spending on brief appearances by an accused ahead of a trial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As we have heard in recent weeks amid the debate that has flared up around critical backlogs in the B.C. court system, an accused can appear before a judge, six, seven, eight times before his or her trial begins. This takes a judge away from more meaningful work, such as preliminary hearings and the actual trials themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But getting access to a forever-busy judge for these administrative appearances – which are often housekeeping matters – can be a scheduling nightmare. Consequently, some cases get dragged out for so long they get thrown out because timelines have violated the rights of the accused.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta was struggling with the same issue, and decided to effectively set up two courts: an assignment court, which, provided the administrative judge agrees that the case is ready to proceed, leads to the designation of a courtroom; and a low-complexity court for those wishing to plead guilty. (Almost a third of defendants in B.C. do plead guilty on first appearance.) This court also deals with other summary matters that don't require a trial and more minor, administrative legal matters involving the Crown and defence that don't really require a trial judge's opinion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This way a trial judge's valuable time isn't taken up by brief appearances in which, in some instances, the Crown might hand over a few documents to the defence. There is a range of other administrative matters, much of them related to scheduling, that once occurred in the presence of a judge and that now take place at the courthouse registry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta program hasn't solved all of the province's court-pressure problems. But it's a start. And it demonstrates the kind of collaborative, imaginative problem-solving that will be increasingly necessary in a world where money isn't available to solve every public-policy dilemma that crops up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Necessity may be the mother of invention. A lack of cash can be too sometimes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ontario English Catholic Teachers Association has called for schools to stop installing WiFi because it poses a “potential health and safety risk” to staff and students.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's hope that the science being taught in our schools is a lot better than the “scientific” reports that teachers are producing for each other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's because the OECTA WiFi study, entitled “A position regarding the use of Non-Ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation, including WiFi, in the workplace,” is a disturbing mix of fear-mongering, false assumptions and twisted logic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where to begin?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We think there is enough evidence to bring concerns and raise the question,” said OECTA president Kevin O'Dwyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Okay, let's examine the evidence. Last year the International Agency for Research on Cancer (part of the World Health Organization) said the radio-frequency electromagnetic fields emitted by cellphones were “possibly carcinogenic.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WiFi routers also emit RF waves, though they are a fraction of the low-level radiation produced by cellphones. Based on this leap of logic, teachers want schools to be hardwired for Ethernet, rather than equipped with much cheaper WiFi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By one estimate, a year's worth of exposure to WiFi is the equivalent of talking 20 minutes on a cellphone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, we take what is at best a theoretical risk, reduce it considerably and we have … a potential “workplace hazard”? Hardly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not to mention that FM radio, television, microwave ovens, the ground (in the form of radon) and the sun that shines down from the sky produce low-level radiation as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are Ontario's 45,000 Catholic teachers equally concerned with these potentially carcinogenic threats lurking in schools and schoolyards?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radiation exposure from WiFi is about 100,000 times less than waves emitted from a microwave. Have the microwaves been removed from school cafeterias and teachers' lunchrooms?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What about coffee?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The IARC also considers that a level 2b carcinogen, meaning it's about as ‘dangerous' as cellphones. (Which, let's remember, are many magnitudes more “dangerous” than WiFi.) One can imagine that the teachers' lounge would be a considerably less pleasant place if the potential health and safety threat called java were removed from schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The OECTA paper says that in addition to being a risk for cancer, WiFi can cause “headaches, nausea, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, weakness, pressure in the head, and a racing or fluttering heart (tachycardia).”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the evidence for these claims is the same as the “evidence” that vaccines cause autism – it is pure balderdash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The teachers' union says WiFi should be banned from schools for the same reason that peanuts are banned, because it poses a danger to some.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Again, that is a truly dubious comparison. Exposure to peanuts can trigger anaphylaxis, a life-threatening condition. Exposure to WiFi, on the other hand, can, well, ummmm, allow you to access the Internet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The OECTA paper claims that about 3 per cent of students and staff suffer from an “environmental sensitivity called electro-hypersensitivity, which is an increased sensitivity to non-ionizing radiation, and may become ill when WiFi is initialized.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many Canadians with environmental sensitivities – most related to exposure to chemicals – but there is absolutely no evidence that these are in any way linked to electromagnetic waves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Somebody spent a little too much time doing “research” on the Internet – presumably using an Ethernet connection, or dressed in a lead suit. (Oops, lead is carcinogen too.) The most troubling part of the OECTA position paper, however, is its reliance on Orwellian language, with ominous pseudoscientific claims that there are “growing concerns” and “possible risks” from WiFi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growing concerns?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, about a dozen private schools in Ontario and B.C. banned WiFi, based on the same dubious “evidence.” It's a circular argument, not a growing concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thankfully, other unions like the Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario rejected a ban on WiFi, opting instead to embrace science, both in and out of the classroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If anything, the more study there is of WiFi, the more reassuring the findings. Health Canada, the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, the U.K.'s Health Protection Agency and numerous other credible groups have all declared that WiFi poses no health risk. But the OECTA sidesteps these small details by conveniently invoking the “precautionary principle,” the precept that an action should not be taken if the consequences are uncertain and potentially dangerous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the precautionary principle is not an absolute. There's no risk-free activity in life. You have to balance benefits and risks. There are many benefits to having WiFi, and even the benefits of WiFi over Ethernet – such as convenience and lower cost – are pretty clear. At the same time, the potential dangers of WiFi – no matter how much you gussy them up – are virtually non-existent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is hard to imagine why the OECTA would produce such an intellectually dubious report, essentially aligning itself with fringe groups. No matter how well-intentioned, surely there are a lot more pressing and real health concerns in its schools like childhood obesity and ensuring kids have safe routes to school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exercise merits a big, fat red-marker F.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apple owes much of its extraordinary success to an uncanny ability to stay one step ahead of consumers' expectations. Now, some customers have a new demand: ethical iPads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hi-tech giant must show it takes the labour conditions of those who toil in its overseas supply-chain partners as seriously as it takes the nifty design of new products. Otherwise, the company risks harming its brand.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's recent decision to become the first hi-tech company to join the Fair Labour Association last month is laudable. Some critics question the independence of the association, which was founded in 1999 by universities and advocacy groups, but there is no doubt it has helped end labour abuse in factories in El Salvador and other countries in Latin America and Asia. Labour inspectors will now go into such mammoth plants as FoxConn city in Chengdu and Shenzhen, China, where iPads and iPhones are assembled. Workers there complain of 12-hour shifts, crowded living conditions and excessive overtime. In 2010, there was a rash of suicides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Protests organized by watchdog groups SumOfUs and Change.org at Apple stores around the world regarding the health, safety and environmental conditions inside these factories have brought the issue to the fore. The groups also delivered petitions signed by more than 250,000 people. One former Apple executive told the New York Times: “Most people would be really disturbed if they saw where their iPhone comes from.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apple already has a supplier code of conduct with detailed standards on labour issues and safety protections, and publishes its own annual audits of suppliers. Last month for the first time, it made public its list of suppliers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the company must take more responsibility for enforcing its manufacturing standards. Changing the workplace culture at overseas suppliers without sacrificing quotas and profits will be a challenge. But it is also an opportunity. By its example, Apple could inspire industry-wide change. Public outcry and advocacy campaigns forced Gap, <span class="companylink">Nike</span> and other apparel companies to end workplace abuse, including the firing of pregnant women, in Latin America in the 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apple doesn't want to be linked with foreign workers who are so despondent they would rather jump out their dorm window than assemble another iPhone 5. Instead, it has a chance to be a transformational leader and inspire other blue-chip hi-tech companies to take labour violations in China and elsewhere more seriously.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the not-too-distant future, we will look back at governance frameworks (public and private) and think of them as having been, at best, quaint. How did we allow privatized returns to become so untethered from socialized risks? How did we allow the severe imbalances that will preoccupy policy-makers for coming generations? Most agree that we need to find new models to collaboratively address these challenges at a global level. What emerges must focus on addressing inequalities, including those between current and future generations.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The risk of default is high. Crises in inequality and governability increasingly feed social instability. As we have seen, this can easily lead to vicious cycles, particularly in our tightly interconnected world. But the way forward is far from clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A starting point should be acknowledging shared responsibility for creating many of our dysfunctional systems. Heroes and victims (as well as the usual villains), have each played a role. A second step forward is to recognize that meaningful reforms must be both political and economic. How can we alter biases, incentives, cultures and behaviours in both sectors?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How is it, for example, that the Big Three auto makers were driven to build far more vehicles than the market demanded in the runup to the auto bailouts? One study argues they did so to compete on the hours-per-vehicle metric widely used by investment analysts as an indicator of efficiency. Increasing production also allowed them to keep the costs of excess capacity off their income statements and on the balance sheet in the form of inventory. All in spite of the obvious damage to sustainable performance (and reputation).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent Bank of England study found that “investment choice, like other life choices, is being retuned to a shorter wavelength,” leading to irrational decisions – particularly with respect to projects of longer duration that often yield the highest private (and social) returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key focus in searching for durable solutions must be on intergenerational equity. One reform, discussed at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, is the need for new leadership norms (in both the political and economic spheres) – striking a balance between older generations and youth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While our legal systems are infused with the notion of equity and fairness between contemporaries, we have yet to embrace the notion that justice should be facilitated between members of different generations. One exception has been in environmental law. For example, many of the provinces and the federal government have enacted “sustainable development” legislation, designed to improve environmental decision-making. The statutes define “sustainable development” as meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How can we expect better, longer-term decision-making processes when our legal frameworks are still largely reactive and short-term focused? One possibility may be to breathe new life into legal norms that have fallen out of favour over time. For example, the fiduciary duty of trustees includes a duty of impartiality, which should require them to balance short-term and long-term considerations. How many today could defend themselves from a claim that future generations are being dealt with in a less than evenhanded manner? Can they demonstrate that they have identified and impartially considered the conflicting interests of beneficiary groups – present and future?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as law- and regulation-making must generally be accompanied by cost-benefit analysis and “notice-and-comment” procedures, perhaps the time has come to develop a more applied principle of intergenerational equity – requiring legislatures, judges, pension fund trustees and, yes, corporate CEOs and boards of directors to consider and be held accountable for the impact current decisions have on future generations' interests – each in their particular contexts. Such a principle would not necessarily put the interests of future generations ahead of our own, but should make those interests more explicit. In doing so, it might generate deeper sensitivity and serve as an effective antidote to the demographic imbalances and broader short-term orientation that challenge us all.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a baptism by ire. Earlier this month, Sana Hassainia, 37, a rookie NDP MP and first-time mother from Quebec, got a taste of how the personal can become political.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In news stories that went round the media, she said she felt pressured to leave the House of Commons because she had brought her three-month-old son, Skander-Jack, into the chamber for a vote (related to the abolition of the long-gun registry). The incident caused a commotion not just in the chamber, causing MPs to erupt in debate about the family-unfriendly nature of Parliament, where there are no maternity benefits, but also outside in a media scrum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later, House Speaker Andrew Scheer issued a clarification, saying he had instructed the page not to bounce infant and mom, but to ask them to take their seats. Some MPs had been taking pictures of the baby, and photographs are not allowed. MPs should try to arrange childcare as best they can, he said, but in cases of emergency, babies are allowed. The Globe and Mail spoke to Ms. Hassainia, who represents Verchères-Les Patriotes (just east of Montreal), on the phone from her office in Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Was there anything in your life before you were elected to prepare you for political life?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not really, except just being interested in politics. I was born in Tunisia, grew up in France, and then I returned to Tunisia before I immigrated to Canada in 2000. I was a teacher of French and when I came to Canada, I worked in a printing company in administration. My husband and I were always interested in politics when we lived in Tunisia, but at that time, it was a dictatorship so it was hard to get involved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Did the incident feel like a harsh introduction into the life of a politician?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have learned a lot since the election, but these last few weeks have been an accelerated course. I didn't necessarily like it, especially for my son who suddenly found himself in pictures and all of that. I am protective of him like all mothers would be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Did you worry about taking on such a demanding job and having a young baby?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was already pregnant during the campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And of course, I thought about it, but I felt that I was ready and up for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When did you return to work after having the baby?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I took two months off. But even if I had had the opportunity to take maternity leave, I wouldn't have taken it, because I felt I should be back at work as soon as possible representing my constituents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is your childcare and work balance like?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My son is too young to be in day care. It hasn't been a long time since my husband arrived in Canada, so we decided it would be best if he stayed home with the baby. He was a reporter in Tunisia before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the moment, I come into the office every day but it's a juggle to fit everything into the schedule because I am breastfeeding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We live about a 15-minute drive away in the town of Gatineau, Que., and I go back home two or three or times a day to breastfeed the baby, in between committee meetings, votes, meetings and Question Period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, I express my milk and leave it with my husband so he can feed the baby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What happened on that day in the House of Commons?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was not in my office at that moment, and there was an unexpected call to vote. We were all together in the car in the Gatineau on the Quebec side of the river, coming home from the grocery store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We had about 20 minutes to get to the Parliament buildings to vote, so there was no time to take the baby home first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When we got to the House of Commons, there was 15 minutes before the vote, so I had time to quickly breastfeed the baby in a staff office upstairs and I planned to leave the baby with his father. But when I came out and went down to the lobby, there was a little less than two minutes before the vote. I couldn't find my husband. So I had to take the baby into the House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Did you hesitate?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, but I had already been told before by party officials that it was okay to bring a baby into the House, in the case of emergency. Also it was a vote that was meant to last only five minutes, so I thought that would be fine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Was there commotion right away?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was only the three or four MPs who sit around me who leaned over to talk to me a little bit and look at the baby. Everyone likes to look at a baby. It's natural.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do you feel as a woman who brings a baby to the office, you are seen as less committed to your work?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I feel that very much. It's weird that we are perceived as weak if we bring our child into work, whereas a father who looks after his child in the workplace, even if it's on the rare occasion, he will be seen as a hero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I understand that you gave your son a hyphenated first name, Skander-Jack, with the Jack being a tribute to Jack Layton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We found out I was having a boy in July and when Jack Layton died, we decided to give the second name as a tribute. He was born in November, a few months after [Mr. Layton] died. It is a private thing, done with discretion. Skander is Alexander but of Russian and Turkish origin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do you have a cradle for Skander-Jack in your office?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slowly but surely, you get the sense it's coming. For all the lousy hockey being played by so many teams around the Toronto Maple Leafs in the standings and for all the fundamental flaws afflicting all of them, it certainly feels as if could-have-been-worse won't work any more.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So here's some free advice for general manager Brian Burke: Let everybody else spin their wheels getting a forward before the NHL trade deadline next week. Go get a goaltender, okay? (And, yes, this was written before Mark Fayne's overtime shot hit Tyler Bozak's stick and dipped and fluttered and bounced off the ice and hit Jonas Gustavsson and … how the hell did that go in, anyhow?) First things: The Toronto Maple Leafs' 4-3 overtime loss Tuesday to the resurgent New Jersey Devils aside, there is no more or less reason to believe this Wednesday morning that the Leafs can make the playoffs, as was the case when they left for western Canada and had losses to the Calgary Flames and Vancouver Canucks sandwiched around an overtime win over the Edmonton Oilers. There's some bad teams out there, folks. But when does all this become points and opportunity lost, especially with the Leafs because of two achingly soft goals – including one with 1 minute 49 seconds left in the second period by Alexei Ponikarovsky that might be remembered in April. The winner was going wide before Gustavsson reacted, deflecting it into the net, and the puck sure seems to find the holes on The Monster, doesn't it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soft? I don't know: But I'll bet you Martin Brodeur stops it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey is the NHL's renaissance team: The Devils have eight consecutive road wins and are 9-1-1 since the all-star break and their own goaltender, Brodeur, has eight of them since making an adjustment to his goalie pads – adding height and width to them, shaping them a little differently at the knee, sacrificing a little of his preferred-mobility while staying within the rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the eight teams holding down playoff spots in each conference heading into the NHL's games Tuesday, seven other teams were within five points of eighth place in their respective conferences, and it seems as if everybody is looking for the same commodity as the trade deadline approaches Monday: a big forward or a shut-down defenceman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burke, it says here, should focus on that big forward in the off-season if, as it seems, Rick Nash is out of his reach, especially given the exorbitant in-season price being demanded for second- or third-line forwards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Besides, at this rate that Leafs' first-round pick might be worth more in the summer.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this past week ought to have reinforced in Burke's mind that this team is still core pieces away from getting where it needs to be – not just a touch here or a touch there. And nights like Tuesdays should push Burke toward adding a goaltender before the expiration of the deadline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the least he needs to do: bring in a veteran and then decide in the summer what to do with Gustavsson and James Reimer. There is no reason to be married to either of them. Maybe that goalie gets them into the playoffs. Maybe he doesn't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's nice that head coach Ron Wilson didn't throw Gustavsson under the bus after the game – “We have to do a better job of supporting our goaltender,” he said – but the guess here is nobody in this city is buying it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The calendar says it's Feb. 22, Toronto, and where is your No. 1 goaltender? Not here, that's for sure. Not here.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you've ever followed a weight-loss diet, you might be familiar with the 3,500-calorie rule.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's pretty simple: Since there are 3,500 calories in a pound of body fat, eating 500 fewer calories each day – or burning them off exercising – will lead to a slow and steady weight loss of a pound a week. (The math: 500 x 7 days = 3,500)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to U.S. researches, this ubiquitous weight-loss rule is overly simple and overly optimistic. And it can lead to unrealistic expectations about how quickly you can achieve a weight-loss goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rule contends that cutting 200 calories a day from your diet would lead to a loss of 20 pounds over the course of a year and the weight loss should keep on going. But in reality that doesn't happen. Weight loss slows and eventually comes to a halt despite the drop in calorie intake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This past weekend, at the American Association for the Advancement of Science's annual meeting in Vancouver, an international team of researchers unveiled a new formula to better predict how people will lose weight on a diet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 3,500-calorie assumption doesn't account for how metabolism changes during weight loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your metabolism is the rate at which your body burns calories, and it's largely determined by how much muscle you have, since muscle burns more calories at rest than body fat. Ultimately, it's your metabolism that dictates how easily you will lose or gain weight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the body slims down, metabolism slows, causing it to burn fewer calories at rest. A smaller body also burns fewer calories during exercise. The net result: a sluggish rate of weight loss that can frustrate dieters and cause them to abandon their plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now health-care professionals and researchers have a tool to more accurately predict a dieter's expected weight loss over time, based on changes to metabolism. Having a more realistic sense of what to expect can help people stay motivated over the long term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new formula and accompanying web-based model were developed by researchers from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the World Health Organization, Columbia University and Harvard School of Public Health,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The online tool – called the Body Weight Simulator – requires people to input their age, gender, body weight, height, activity level and weight goal (bwsimulator.niddk.nih.gov).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It then simulates what diet and exercise changes are required to reach the goal weight and what changes are necessary to maintain it over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using this model, the researchers found that people's bodies adapt slowly to dietary changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the updated formula shows that the average overweight person needs to cut 100 calories from their current intake per day to lose 10 pounds over three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Half of the weight will be lost in one year and then you'll reach a plateau, slowly losing the remainder by three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, for the same calorie reduction, the 3,500-calorie formula predicts you'll lose 10 pounds in one year – and 30 pounds by three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Body Weight Simulator isn't aimed at consumers. It's intended to be used as a tool for doctors, dietitians and researchers to re-evaluate client goals and identify necessary diet and exercise changes to achieve a weight loss goal at a realistic pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The online tool also highlights a salient point: Even though weight loss slows down over time, you will continue to lose weight if you stick to your plan. That's a positive message for anyone trying to lose weight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new formula also emphasizes the need to abandon our quick-fix mentality. Permanent weight loss takes time and requires persistence, consistency and patience. Not easy, I know.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other reasons weight loss slows down that have nothing to do with metabolism. They're related to human nature and they're within your control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're experiencing a slowdown, the following strategies can help you pick up the pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't let lapses accumulate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You're bound to fall off plan occasionally. Losing weight is not an all-or-nothing endeavour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you slip, don't tell yourself “I'll start again on Monday.” Instead, get back on track, the sooner the better. One small lapse won't make a difference to the scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rein in portion sizes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It happens gradually. Instead of one cup of rice, you're serving yourself 1.5 cups and an extra 100 calories. The chicken breast that not long ago was a precise four ounces, now weighs in at six ounces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few extra calories here and there add up and can make the difference between losing and holding steady. If this sounds familiar, measure and weigh your foods again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be mindful of extras</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An extra dessert, a few tastes while making dinner, a bite or two off your kid's plate. Those extra calories can – and will – stall weight loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty pounds ago you could get away with eating something extra here and there and still lose weight each week. But not any more. Keep in mind that smaller bodies burn fewer calories, so you have less leeway than before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resume keeping a food diary to see if extra calories are sneaking into your diet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be consistent on the weekend</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Larger meals, alcoholic beverages, and a few extra snacks on the weekend can cause the needle on the scale to jump Monday morning. You play catch-up during the week to lose those few pounds. Then the following weekend, you put a couple more back on. The end result: no progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If weekends are your trouble spot, keep a food diary Friday through Sunday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will there really be a trade war with the European Union over imports of Canadian fuel from the oil sands?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The media have been reporting it this way, based on letter sent in December to the EU environmental commissioner by Canada's EU ambassador. It said that if the proposed EU fuel quality directive (FQD) is enacted, Canada will march to the World Trade Organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This comes at an unfortunate time, since Canadian and European negotiators are trying to put the final touches on a groundbreaking, comprehensive economic and trade agreement. A high-profile controversy involving Canada's oil sands certainly doesn't help that process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when it comes to anything that tarnishes the international reputation of Alberta's oil, the federal government has no choice other than to get in the fight. For Ottawa, this is shaping up as a battle for hearts and minds, not unlike the battles Canada has been engaged in over the years fighting foreign restrictions on imports of seal products or Quebec-made chrysotile asbestos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will involve an air war and a ground war. The air war will be the ongoing PR battle, the battle for the heart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ground war, the battle for the mind, will be the trade battle, and that's what the Canadian ambassador's letter was all about – preventing EU carbon offsets in the FDQ being imposed that differentiate between bitumen-derived products and conventional fuels. These offsets are effectively a border tax on Canadian oil sands fuels to compensate for the carbon emitted in their production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a fundamental WTO legal issue at stake in the ground war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It concerns the WTO prohibition against governments discriminating against “like” goods from different countries. This is the famous most-favoured-nation treatment rule. It requires fully equivalent treatment to imports of “like” goods wherever they come from. And the equally famous “national treatment” rule means that you can't discriminate against imports in favour of “like” domestic products. It means that all duties, taxes or other border measures – such as carbon offset requirements – that differentiate between these “like” goods are WTO-illegal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question comes down to what is “likeness” in WTO terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Numerous WTO panel decisions have said that “likeness” is based on the intrinsic nature of the goods, not how they are made. Likeness is determined by physical properties, usage and, importantly, whether the goods compete in the same market. It is the direct “competitiveness” of the goods that is normally critical in determining likeness, according to these decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How the goods are made – production and process methods – is not a differentiating factor when the imported goods are like domestic products and other imports in every other respect. A 2011 WTO Secretariat Working Paper examined the jurisprudence in depth going back many years and concluded that border measures based on production methods that don't affect the “likeness” of the final product would be in contravention of the WTO Agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coming back to the Canada-EU dispute, the issue is this: Can the EU apply differential border measures – such as carbon offsets – on fuel from Canada that is produced from bitumen but is “like” conventional fuels in terms of physical and chemical properties, end-usage and, importantly, that competes in the same market?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada says definitely not. Admittedly, each case must be looked at on its facts, but WTO jurisprudence leads to the conclusion that Canada is right.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few times a month, Karen Viva-Haynes, a Cordon Bleu trained chef, serves dinner in her catering kitchen. She cooks seasonal, local food with great skill. The night we were there, the conversation flowed among the 14 guests along with the incredible eight courses of food. This is the appetizer she served us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alternative ways to serve are in espresso cups as a small first course or piped into split snow peas. Arctic char can be hard to find. Substitute with smoked trout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Prep time: 10 minutes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Ready in: 35 minutes</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2 tablespoons finely chopped green onion</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 tablespoon prepared horseradish</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fold in Arctic char and don't worry if it breaks up into smaller pieces at this point. Season with salt and pepper and adjust the hot pepper sauce and Worcestershire sauce to taste.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spread this mixture into the casserole dish and top with the chopped pecans and finally sprinkle with smoked paprika.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEPPI'S PICKS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is an exciting menu for adventurous wine imbibers. Leave the shiraz, cabernet and chardonnay at the door and consider entering the Bohemian salon of riesling, gruner-veltliner, shochu and sake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Have I lost you yet? Then let me start with malbec. Argentina's signature red has a gutsy grip to handle the zesty tomato sauce and cured pancetta in the lentil dish. The Korean soup is a spice and umami extravaganza. For that, I'd suggest Austrian gruner-veltliner, a white with a sour-fruity dual personality, its sour side harmonizing with the soy-fish sauce and its fruitiness taming the spice while coasting above and complementing the dish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But you might also consider shochu, the spirit distilled from barley, sweet potatoes or rice, popular in Japan and Korea (where it's called soju). At about 25-per-cent alcohol, it delivers a modestly bracing kick and will not fall on the swords of the radish or chili. Besides, you don't want to sip loads of wine with a soup. Good sake is a fine alternative. Serve either chilled. For the smoked fish, go for fruity-crisp riesling.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A group called Friends of the Earth Europe is making much of Canadian documents it has obtained under a freedom-of-information request, but in fact Joe Oliver, the Minister of Natural Resources, made public the federal government's position in October, 2011, in a letter to the EU's commissioner for energy. He raised the prospect that Canada would “not hesitate to defend its interests” if “unjust, discriminatory measures … are put in place.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the WTO, countries have a duty to treat similar goods from other countries similarly to their own, and not to discriminate. Some elements in the EU, however, are trying to stigmatize oil-sands bitumen as being in an ignominious class of its own. What's more, WTO case law has already established that different production processes – oil-sands extraction requires special techniques – do not make similar products dissimilar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This controversy has a hypothetical, somewhat unreal, quality, because Canada does not export bitumen to Europe from the oil sands. Europe does, however, import comparable heavy crudes from Nigeria and the Middle East – which are often worse on the emissions front. The EU measure, if approved, would be a rhetorical gesture, but one that would doubtless be invoked in other settings in order to damage Canada's reputation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A vote is scheduled for Thursday. Fortunately, Britain and France are on Canada's side, and a number of other EU members appear well disposed, too. The federal government is right not to let the oil sands be manipulated as a pawn in a much larger debate over climate change.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Children who are conceived with an egg or sperm donor should have the right to know their biological origins. The quest for this knowledge is really a quest to know themselves. In the same way governments once moved toward eliminating the presumption of anonymity from adoption rules, they must now reform laws around donating sperm and eggs, and acknowledge the importance of this issue to donor-conceived offspring. Any changes, however, should not be applied retroactively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently in Canada, the law guiding this complex aspect of assisted human reproduction is unclear. Provincial fertility clinics collect the medical history of egg and sperm donors, but under federal legislation, donors are not required to give up confidentiality.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This leaves donor-conceived offspring in the dark, forced to fight expensive and time-consuming legal battles when they become adults and inevitably start to ask questions about their life narrative. One such battle is under way in British Columbia, where the government is appealing a lower court ruling that found a woman named Olivia Pratton, conceived in 1982 at a Vancouver fertility clinic, had the legal right to know the identity of the sperm donor. The government argued this month in court that it has no constitutional obligation to include donor-conceived offspring in the Adoption Act, and accord them the same rights to know their biological parentage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research shows that depriving children of the ability to access their genetic backgrounds can cause them psychological harm. Much less likely, they could inadvertently end up in a romantic relationship with a half-sibling. The experience of hiding the truth from adoptive children has shown how destructive family secrets can be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other countries have already moved forward; in Australia, the U.K. and Sweden, all egg and sperm donors must now agree to disclose their identities. There are national registries to ensure that donor-conceived offspring can access the information when they come of age, even if clinics close and records are lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada, the regulatory framework is complicated by the fact that the Supreme Court struck down parts of the Assisted Human Reproductive Act in 2010, ruling it is up to the provinces to regulate fertility clinics. It left in place a ban on paying donors, and other elements in the act, including those governing the use of human embryos in stem-cell research. But there are regulatory voids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is time for Ottawa to work with the provinces to bring clarity to this important aspect of assisted reproduction, and ensure that the best interests of all donor-conceived offspring are taken into account.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the early 1980s, government restraint sent thousands of people into the streets in British Columbia in protest. On Tuesday, the government of Premier Christy Clark introduced a budget as tightfisted as any the province has seen in 30 years.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it's unlikely to ignite the kind of social unrest unleashed by the earlier restraint budgets of Social Credit premier Bill Bennett.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were enough early references in Finance Minister Kevin Falcon's budget speech to Greece and to the perils of governments that disregard basic economic imperatives that it was easy to tell the direction his fiscal plan would take. What was surprising was the degree to which the B.C. Liberals both cut and held the line in key spending areas and began bending the cost curve downward in other traditionally big-spending portfolios, such as health and education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. is the most fiscally conservative government in the country at the moment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The landscape is littered with governments that have forgotten the importance of managing spending and taxation prudently,” Mr. Falcon said in his budget speech. “Now they find themselves in very dire situations.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He didn't mention Ontario. But he didn't need to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like all budgets, this one is as much a political document as it is an economic one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals have been hemorrhaging support from the right flank of their coalition. Ms. Clark, whose roots in the federal Liberal party run deep, desperately needs to establish her fiscal-conservative bona fides in order to arrest the damage being inflicted to her party by the resurgent B.C. Conservatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This may have done it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everything about the budget seemed to be couched in prudent, cautious terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government spending over the next three years will average a modest 2 per cent. Economic growth forecasts of 1.8, 2.2 and 2.5 per cent over the next three years are extremely judicious and below the rates projected by the private sector and the government's economic forecast council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fiscal plan also includes $800-million in contingency funds over the next three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government intends to reduce the civil service by more than 2,000 people by the end of 2014/15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The K-12 education budget barely moved from 2011-12 to 2012-13. It was $5.2-billion a year ago and will be $5.3-billion this year. More impressive, however, is what the B.C. government has done with health-care costs, which not that long ago were rising at the rate of about 7 per cent a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next few years, the budget forecasts Health Ministry spending to increase by an average of less than 3 per cent a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, the budgets of 14 of 17 ministries have either been cut or increased by less than 1 per cent over the next three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Falcon seemed almost embarrassed to admit that the province's debt-to-GDP ratio was going to inch up to 18.3 per cent in 2014-15 before – if all goes according to plan – it begins to go downward again. (B.C.'s accumulated debt will hit $66-billion in two years). By contrast, Ontario's debt-to-GDP ratio is 37 per cent. The country's as a whole is 35 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Plecas, a top bureaucrat in the B.C. government throughout the 1980s and 90s, said the budget could easily have been crafted during B.C.'s notorious restraint era.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a bit of a throwback budget to be sure,” said Mr. Plecas, who was known as Dr. Death for his role in crafting the infamous restraint budget of 1983 which put a vise-grip on spending and lowered the boom on public-sector unions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When you look at what they're doing with FTEs (full-time equivalents) in government, at the end of it they're likely going to have the lowest public service numbers since the 1970s. Even during the restraint era of the 1980s, we had more.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Clark's government appears intent on making those cuts without ripping up contracts the way she did with teachers when she was education minister under Gordon Campbell in 2001 and the way Bill Bennett's government did in 1983. Consequently, this budget is unlikely to incite widespread public-sector protests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, it is a different time, and governments around the world are discovering what happens when you spend without regard to the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Clark is betting British Columbians will support the kind of restraint this budget represents, even if it comes at the expense of workers who haven't seen a raise in years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of the day, Ms. Clark was warning the legislature about the billions she claims the opposition New Democratic Party has pledged to spend to finance programs she says the province can't afford. That is in contrast, she said, to her government, which manages tax dollars prudently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As much as anything, Tuesday's budget established the ground upon which next year's election will be fought.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the movies nominated for best picture, a bunch were really made for television. Including The Artist, which is, ironically about moviemaking. If a bunch of European broadcasters had not fronted money for the thing, it would never have existed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are the so-called movie stars. Don't get me started. Gaze, if you will, at the list of people hoping to take home a 34-centimetre statue and most of them would still be toiling in obscurity if it weren't for TV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brad Pitt – first real acting job was as Walker Lovejoy, an idealistic newspaper journalist, no less, in Glory Days, one of the very first Fox TV dramas. Before that he had bit parts on Dallas (yes, Dallas!) and 21 Jump Street, a show that also gave one Johnny Depp a first real acting job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Oldman? Those devoted to Brit TV – and a lot of people still are – will remember his standout work in a grim British TV movie called Meantime, written and directed by Mike Leigh. Decades ago, that was. Most of George Clooney's body of acting work has been done on TV, on everything from ER to Roseanne. Michelle Williams started on Baywatch and would be nothing if she hadn't been cast on Dawson's Creek. Rooney Mara arrived in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and everybody was all, “Who's this totally amazing new star?” but anyone who watches TV probably remembers her as a victim on Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit and a hospital patient on ER. I could go on. Don't get me started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a notion out there that movies and television exist on different planets. It's true to some extent – television has become the greater art form.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bring on Sunday and as you're watching Billy Crystal suck up to has-been actors in the audience, remember that the Academy Awards isn't even the biggest show on TV any more, it's just another TV variety program. Besides, movies are no longer the reason for fair-to-middling viewing numbers. It's the frock opera before the show that matters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while you watch, if you must, know you are taking part in the last step of a process that started with TV. Don't get me started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ash Wednesday. The start of Lent. If you think the Academy Awards are a big deal, repent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airing Tonight</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republic of Doyle (CBC, 9 p.m.) is fine tomfoolery tonight. The gist is this: “High school comes back to haunt Jake when his former nemesis, all-star athlete and first-class jerk Clyde Cowley (Luke Kirby), swings back into his life. Turns out Clyde's misplaced some money – a cool hundred grand – and needs Jake's assistance to get it back. Jake's reluctant to help until he lays eyes on Clyde's ex, Jessica (Natalie Brown), Jake's crush from high school.” A highly pleasant way to spend an hour. High-school crush. Fist fights. St. John's in the sunshine. And nice to see Luke Kirby, he being fondly remembered from the short-lived but excellent Cra$h &amp; Burn.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everywhere in Canada, the news is about natural resources: forestry and mines in British Columbia; oil and coal in Alberta; potash in Saskatchewan; hydro in Manitoba; the “ring of fire” minerals in Ontario; hydro and Old Harry oil and shale gas in Quebec; offshore oil and hydro in Newfoundland.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians are so damn lucky. We just dig and pump and cut and ship, and we never seem to run out. We just hope commodities prices remain high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All those resources can be a fool's game. Pumping and digging and cutting can keep the country comfortable, but they do little to address our biggest challenge – a sagging competitive position. All those resources soak up capital; they usually don't require much innovation or processing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Harper government, possessed of a majority government, seems to have its mind around elements of the long-term challenge. Whether it can persuade the country to confront them is another matter, in part because this government doesn't like “visionary” politics, and in part because of its relentless partisanship, which waxes so many ears beyond its own supporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada has one of the worst productivity records in the industrialized world. Upon productivity improvements household incomes depend, not burgeoning household debt. When you ask why median household incomes stagnated for a long time, and why the lowest-income Canadians have gotten poorer, one reason is low productivity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the country's long-term challenge is demographics. The population is aging (the first boomers hit 65 in 2011). Slowly, aging will influence everything for the next 25 years. It will strain public finances in two ways. First, social programs for seniors will cost more. Second, there will be fewer people in the work force relative to those who are not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If nothing changes, taxes will certainly have to rise on them just to deal with aging alone, unless those who remain in the work force are more productive. You don't have to like the Harper government, or agree with its yet-unknown prescriptions, to understand that it has identified this inescapable issue. And you don't have to like any particular government to know that a Canada Pension Plan worked out almost half a century ago (and Old Age Security somewhat later), when people lived shorter lives, has to be revisited. And that a health-care program devised at about the same time also needs an overhaul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government has also grabbed hold of the immigration challenge, a major determinant of long-term productivity for Canada. Immigration is not working as it did for so long. Many recent studies have shown that immigrants are falling faster into poverty, taking much longer to reach average incomes and are collectively a drag on productivity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of this reversal undoubtedly relates to domestic policies; some relates to who the immigrants are, where they come from, what they don't know when they arrive, and what languages they do not speak. The government is right to try to change admission criteria to make immigration work better for Canada. (And to change the refugee-determination system to fast-track out of Canada those coming from a list of democratic countries.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Prime Minister's recent trip to China pointed to another reality: the fast-developing countries of that region. It took him a long time to wake up, and Canada has a huge catch-up job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governments, in fairness, can only do so much. Business has to do the rest. It's been estimated that only 4 per cent of small- and medium-sized businesses export to developing markets. Sadly, Canada lacks a free-trade deal with any of them in Asia. Canada isn't of much interest to Brazil, and hasn't actively pursued the likes of Turkey and Indonesia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The old model of exploiting natural resources and shipping to the United States will certainly keep Canada comfortable. But increasingly it won't make Canada more productive while the population is aging and immigration isn't working. Without productivity, forget real income growth. Without it, a comfortable stagnation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not just Mitt Romney's fault that he has been unable to effectively wrap up the Republican presidential nomination by now.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two big differences from four years ago – a less compressed primary calendar and the proportional allocation of delegates – make it impossible for any GOP frontrunner to build an insurmountable lead over his rivals before at least late April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, that a candidate with Mr. Romney's money, organization and establishment backing has been unable to make short shrift of such flawed rivals as a beyond-the-mainstream Rick Santorum and a beyond-the-pale Newt Gingrich is giving party bigwigs heartburn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fear is that Mr. Romney's inability to suppress the current insurgency of Mr. Santorum, and his past and potentially future problems with Mr. Gingrich, presage his weakness as a general election candidate against a far more formidable Barack Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Establishment whispers of drafting a consensus candidate in advance of the August GOP convention is back on the front burner this week as polls show Mr. Romney fighting to regain his advantage over Mr. Santorum in his home state of Michigan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Romney were to lose next Tuesday's Michigan primary, or only pull off a narrow victory, those whispers would turn into cries of desperation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Romney has displayed astonishing tone deafness in his failure to speak the concerns of working-class voters, many of whom have been victims of the kind of clinical corporate restructuring the ex-<span class="companylink">Bain Capital</span> chief considers his life's work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, the central conceit of Mr. Romney's candidacy – that he is the turnaround expert needed to get the economy moving – is undermined by Mr. Obama's new pitch that “America is back” and that old-fashioned manufacturing is leading the way. Mr. Obama may be whistling past the graveyard given the truly daunting challenges still facing the American economy as it struggles to come to terms with a bloated public debt, aging population and workforce ill-adapted to the needs of the 21st century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as long as he can rely on employment statistics showing positive monthly growth averaging 200,000 jobs or more, it may be enough to get him a second term in November if he faces opposition of the likes of Mr. Romney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No wonder the whispers in GOP ranks are getting louder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the political equivalent of Fantasy Football, Republican pundits and establishment types are still dreaming about Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie or former Florida governor Jeb Bush at the top of the GOP ticket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All three have publicly demurred, despite their obvious ambition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while each of them is a better politician than Mr. Romney, all of them have their flaws and it is far from clear they would have an easier time winning over the GOP base, much less beating Mr. Obama in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Daniels famously called for a “truce” on social issues, a declaration that all but makes his candidacy a non-starter with the evangelical voters fueling Mr. Santorum's rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Christie is similarly distrusted by social conservatives, despite his vetoing last week of a gay marriage bill that passed the New Jersey legislature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bush would be the strongest candidate of them all, despite his dynastic lineage, which is still a net negative among voters. He is popular with all wings of the Republican Party and, unlike any of the others, has built bridges with Hispanic voters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Bush, who has refused to endorse Mr. Romney, has his eyes on the prize in 2016. So does Mr. Christie, who has vigorously endorsed the ex-Massachusetts governor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, in all likelihood, Mr. Obama will face either Mr. Romney or Mr. Santorum in the fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the odds still overwhelmingly favour Mr. Romney over the ex-Pennsylvania senator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the rest is about as meaningful as Fantasy Football.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turning a grey transit official into a popular hero is quite a trick, but that is just what the administration of Mayor Rob Ford has accomplished by firing <span class="companylink">Toronto Transit Commission</span> chief general manager Gary Webster.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Webster walked into a special TTC gathering on Tuesday to meet his fate, cheers broke out in the public gallery. Supporters were handing out “I (heart) Gary Webster” buttons. When the 5-4 vote to sack him was announced three hours later, the audience shouted “shame.” Even Bob Kinnear, the sharp-tongued transit-union leader, came to Mr. Webster's defence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What explains the extraordinary reaction to his firing? Mr. Webster is hardly the first official to be replaced by his political masters. The TTC is not the most popular institution these days, and the axing of its manager would normally cause little distress to most people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is something different about this. Mr. Webster is being fired just days after a public meeting in which he spoke his mind, in the most calm and respectful manner, about his views on the best way to expand Toronto's transit network. Those views differ sharply from the mayor's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Firing him now reeks of spite. It confirms what many people already feel about the mayor's blunderbuss, my-way-or-the-highway approach to governing the city. It conflicts with the mayor's pledge to cut waste. Firing Mr. Webster only a year and a bit before the end of his contract could cost the city $500,000 and more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worse, it sets a dangerous precedent that could intimidate the other leading public servants who advise the mayor and city council on public policy. Only weeks ago, Toronto Ombudsman Fiona Crean warned about the increasing politicization of the public service. “It can be exceedingly difficult for staff to speak truth to power and provide their best advice as dutiful public servants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Right now,” she added, “there is a perception of risk to speaking out.” Imagine how much stronger that perception will be now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like other episodes in his mayoralty, the Webster firing threatens to blow up in the mayor's face. Dismissing the TTC chief was supposed to reassert the mayor's authority after a key transit vote went against him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, it has undermined his control of an increasingly rebellious city council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has galvanized his opposition on the left. They were in full cry after Mr. Webster's termination, which seemed to confirm everything they have been saying about the mayor's blinkered ways. It has appalled many centrist councillors, who have already been voting against the mayor consistently since the New Year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most damaging to Mr. Ford, it further alienated even conservative councillors who often support him. TTC chair Karen Stintz was joined in voting against Mr. Webster's termination by John Parker, a former Conservative MPP, and TTC vice-chair Peter Milczyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ford may be rid of Mr. Webster, but this shabby act will come back to haunt him.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With recent events in Syria capturing headlines around the world, we have been bombarded with reports and statistics provided by the opposition forces fighting President Bashar al-Assad's Syrian army. Social media reports from the opposition use terminology guaranteed to capture our attention: massacre, genocide, torture, child rape and beheading, to list but a few. Estimates of those killed in any one attack regularly vary by a factor of up to 10 and are always biased to solicit sympathy and concern for the side in the conflict providing them.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With no way to confirm the actual facts, it's not surprising that each country's media coverage, including Canada's, reinforces the natural bias of that country's attitude toward Syria. We should be conscious of the fact, known by every soldier, that initial reports from every battle are wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not to suggest that Mr. Assad isn't being heavy-handed with opposition forces. On the contrary, he is conducting a military campaign using the superior weapon systems available to him, and has no interest in making this a fair fight. An old Russian military adage says, “Never send a soldier where an artillery round can go first.” Many Syrian officers were trained in Russia and, unfortunately, they frequently follow this advice. If the opposition Free Syrian Army is using civilian population centres for sanctuary and bases for operations, they will be targeted regardless of the inevitable casualties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our Western proclivity for anointing a “good” side and vilifying a “bad” side in any conflict has been hasty, as usual. Mr. Assad's Alawite religious sect makes up just 10 per cent of Syria's population and its members are considered pagans by many of the country's Sunnis, who are 75 per cent of the population. Yet, in recent polling funded by the leadership of Qatar (which is currently experiencing frosty relations with Syria), the conclusion was that 55 per cent of Syrians support Mr. Assad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, numerous countries have dispatched special forces to advise and train the opposition's Free Syrian Army. Weapons are being paid for by some countries and delivered by others into opposition enclaves. Public support for the uprising by al-Qaeda's leadership and reports that extremist fighters are showing up with the opposition forces have been conveniently ignored, as was the case in the Libyan conflict. There are even early murmurings that the opposition's Syrian National Council should be recognized as the country's legitimate government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps it would be a good idea to first determine who we are dealing with in the opposition. It was supposed to be “doctors, lawyers and business people” making up the opposition in Libya – that turned out to be wishful thinking, which should be a red flag as we line up with al-Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six weeks ago, the Arab League marched into this melee, anxious to show some muscle after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization did the heavy lifting for it during last year's uprising in Libya. The Arab League called for Mr. Assad to step down, for the imposition of limited sanctions and for a naive deployment by an unarmed observer mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians have participated on more observer missions, mostly under a UN mandate, than any other country in the world. I commanded one myself. We know what works and what is doomed to fail. Observer missions only work if the belligerents agree and want to stop fighting. Observers can facilitate communications between the two sides – or three sides, as was the case in the Balkans – host ceasefire discussions, monitor troop locations, arrange for humanitarian aid delivery and many other tasks made possible by the conflict participants' desire to actually co-operate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The observer mission deployed by the Arab League, on the other hand, was a joke from the start. With both sides continuing to fight and having no intention to stop, it became a “show and tell” exercise for Mr. Assad's forces, which actually escorted the observers to see and hear what they wanted them to see and hear. While new to the game of observer missions, it only took the Arab League observers a few days to realize they had been duped into a mission that was guaranteed to fail. In the end, the mission's boss quit and went home, while the rest took sanctuary in a Damascus hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what was the Arab League's next brilliant idea? To get the UN to deploy a joint unarmed observer mission. Was no one in authority, anywhere, paying attention to the fate of the first mission? Perhaps only in Russia and China, which were roundly condemned for vetoing a Security Council resolution that would have authorized the joint mission. Their critics suggested that if only the resolution had passed, we would be on the way to stopping the killing. Wrong! The threat of another observer mission, no matter how “joint,” would not create a meaningful ceasefire. In fact, experience shows it would likely increase the killing, with each side attempting to take as much territory as possible once they believed there was an actual ceasefire on the horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only solution to the Syrian conflict goes through Moscow. When NATO bombing failed to force an end to the conflict in Kosovo 13 years ago, it was Russian diplomacy that convinced Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw his little-damaged security forces from the region. Mr. Assad doesn't have many supporters these days – it would be wise for Western governments, including Canada, to redirect our efforts from sabre-rattling to coming up with some carrots to convince Vladimir Putin to visit Damascus.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What value do you place on a winery's name? How about two bucks?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a recent psychological study, researchers at Brock University in Niagara found that people were willing to pay an average of $2 more for a wine based purely on the sound of its name. Specifically, they tended to favour a tongue-twisting brand versus one they could more easily pronounce. The findings suggest that unfamiliar or exotic sounds imply scarcity, and that's an attribute frequently associated with quality in the highly impressionable minds of wine shoppers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Names that seem unique or harder to understand or wrap your mind around are that way because they're rare,” said Antonia Mantonakis, the Brock associate professor of marketing who led the study. “Things that are rare are more valuable.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The research was based on a sort of wine analogue to the placebo effect, in which patients are deceptively treated with a dummy drug to test mind over matter. In this case, three groups of 41 to 48 participants each were dispensed the same wine, a Niagara chardonnay produced at Brock University's oenology institute. But they were told different tales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One group was led to believe that the white had been produced by a fictional winery named Titakis. Though Greek-sounding, it was deemed through linguistic testing to be easy to pronounce by English speakers. They were shown the wine's name on paper, rather than a fancy label. Another group was told that it came from the harder-to-pronounce Tselepou winery. And a control group was given no name but asked to judge the sample on its own merits. This provided an objective gauge of the wine's perceived quality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the participants tasted the wine, they were asked three questions: How much do you like the wine? How keen would you be to buy it? How much would you be willing to pay? The first two were rated on a scale of one to seven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The winner, with a half-point advantage for perceived quality and purchase intent, was Tselepou. The convoluted name also was valued at $16, on average, while Titakis sounded like a good buy at $14. The control group was less smitten with its no-name sample, with participants generally falling in the $12-to-$13 range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those spreads might not seem like much, but Dr. Mantonakis says they're statistically significant, not least regarding price. “In the marketplace, a $2 difference is a substantial, meaningful difference,” she said. It's a Grand Canyon span for many consumers, especially in the price-sensitive under-$20 universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The choice of Greek-sounding names was essentially arbitrary. Dr. Mantonakis and student researcher Bryan Galiffi tested several other pairs for “linguistic fluency,” including German examples, but eventually ruled them out for other factors. In at least one case, a name was found to be too similar to an actual winery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, this is just one test, with one specific set of names. Whether we'd see the same results with other name pairs is an open question. Also, consumer choices are based not only on estate names but also on grape varieties and regional designations, such as Burgundy and “grand crus,” which come with their own cachet and may undermine the influence of the mere winery name. In fact, that's the subject of follow-up studies on which Dr. Mantonakis is already working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study's findings offer up a jab at wine snobs' expense. The tasters, all English speakers drawn from a broad base of Niagara residents, were tested for their wine knowledge, as well. Some knew little, unable to cite basic traits associate with popular grape varieties, while others, including some from the wine industry, knew lots. Care to guess which were disposed to paying more for the tongue-twisting Tselepou? Drum roll, please: the wine geeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You'd think they'd rely less on external factors and more on the taste,” Dr. Mantonakis said. “You'd think they'd have the knowledge to be able to judge based on taste rather than the sound of the winery name.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not too surprised, frankly. Wine aficionados often cut plenty of slack to inferior wines simply because they are rare, just as they often harbour disdain for fine stuff that is popular or produced in huge quantity. Smaller is better, the wine-nerd saying goes, and big is bad. Yet blind tastings often prove instinctive preferences to be misplaced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, neophytes often will literally overlook the label and confidently judge with their own taste buds, unfazed by price or reputation (though often a cute critter on the label might seal the deal at the cash register, no question).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiously, Dr. Mantonakis says her results contrast with parallel studies on other commodities. In one fascinating example, two Princeton University psychologists, Adam Alter and Danny Oppenheimer, found that companies with easy-to-say stock-ticker symbols (those three- or four-letter abbreviations that scroll across TV screens on business reports) performed better on the markets than those with symbols that could not be pronounced as a word. Think RAD (<span class="companylink">Rite Aid Corp</span>.), for example, versus the more awkward RDA (for <span class="companylink">Reader's Digest Association Inc</span>.). In one subsequently famous case, <span class="companylink">Harley-Davidson</span> shares shot up 16 per cent in the weeks after it changed its ticker from HDI to HOG, the biker-slang term for its motorcycles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For a stock, you want something that seems less risky,” Dr. Mantonakis says, whereas, with wine, there's cachet in the unfamiliar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's unlikely that the study will prompt wineries to start twisting our tongues in a bid for higher prices. But there's a lesson for the rest of us. “It is useful for consumers to know that something as simple as the sound of a word could influence their judgment about things,” Dr. Mantonakis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How good does that wine in front of you taste? In some cases, not nearly as good as it sounds.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Half of Canadians say they were bullied as children or teens, according to a Harris-Decima poll commissioned by Big Brothers Big Sisters of Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But can that be? Are half of this country victims – presumably of the other half? Is the world really made up of two kinds of people, bullies and victims?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the poll suggests, the discussion of bullying, even the definition of it, is sometimes debased. Bullying needs to be confronted, but in our well-meaning attempts to do so, we risk creating a moral panic that demands institutions micromanage the behaviour of children and, as a result, undermines children's coping skills and resilience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assume that the survey has it right – half of Canadians were bullied in their childhood. Doesn't that show how normal it is to run up against someone, somewhere, who is dominating, or insulting, or exudes a sense of threat? (The adult world is no picnic, either.) The right answer is, usually, not to demand a police investigation or a royal commission. It is, at least in part, to build coping skills in all young people. Resilience is impossible without coping skills, and coping skills don't grow when adults settle all conflicts or try to eradicate even the possibility of conflict. Conflict, too, can be healthy, and human.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But isn't bullying a social evil? Of course it is, and there are countless examples where it has proven deadly – the 1997 beating death of 14-year-old Reena Virk of Victoria, by her peers, being one. There are also countless people for whom the pain of childhood ostracism and public humiliation has contributed to lifelong battles with mental illness or addictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For too long, schools, summer camps and other institutions did not take seriously enough their responsibility to protect those who were vulnerable to serious bullying. Today, though, as worthy anti-bullying programs spread (including the pink-shirt days started in a Nova Scotia high school by students themselves), the pendulum has swung so far that Quebec proposed last week that each school write an annual report on bullying. This is accountability run amok.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no anti-bullying office in schools. There is just a principal and, if she or he is lucky, a vice-principal. Every time a parent comes forward with a complaint, it needs to be investigated. In a world in which conflict is often conflated with bullying (as anecdotal reports suggest), that job becomes impossible. And instant answers (or even accurate fact-finding) are not always possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All young people have a right to a safe environment – but not a bubble. Adults need to keep a watchful eye for rampant victimization – but not to police each conflict in the playground. Bullying is dangerous, but a loss of adult perspective creates an anxiety that has its own dangers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actuary Malcolm Hamilton is exactly this person, but at age 61 he's heading into retirement later this year. What have his 32 years of experience taught him about life after leaving the workforce? Find out in this edited transcript of a conversation we had on topics ranging from whether Canadians are saving enough to the federal government's plans to change Old Age Security.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's an assumption in almost everything written about retirement that people aren't saving enough. How true is that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It hasn't been true historically. During my entire working lifetime, I don't think there was ever a time where Canadians were thought to be saving enough. And yet, during my entire working lifetime, there never seems to have been a time where Canadians had trouble retiring. But the past is no guarantee of the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking ahead, what will the retirement savings challenge be?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frankly, there are legitimate reasons for concern going forward that Canadians won't be as lucky with housing as they have been in the past, and they probably will not be as lucky with government policy. The aging population is going to constrain what governments can do. And, given where interest rates are, they're not likely to be as lucky with rates as we have been in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If people have done okay for themselves in retirement, why are we perpetually being warned that savings levels aren't good enough?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are large numbers of people and institutions who profit if people save for retirement. I don't blame them – that's what they're supposed to do, and they're very good at it. But having said that, they never seem to succeed because they're always dissatisfied with how much people are saving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's talk about government's role in providing retirement income. With Ottawa planning to make changes to OAS, how worried should people be that government austerity will cut into their retirement benefits?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't think the Canada Pension Plan is something that people need to be worried about in the foreseeable future, by virtue of the fact that it's contributory and by virtue of the fact that we get triennial reports saying it's okay. With OAS, we'll see to what extent those benefits are at risk. I don't think a change is required, but the government seems inclined to do it in any event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's the best way for the average person to figure out how much he or she needs for retirement?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think people should be saving what it makes sense for them to save, as long as that allows them to retire some time before the age of 70. It makes more sense for the variable to be retirement age than retirement saving. Live frugally, don't squander your money, spend as you need to on your family and yourself to have a good life, and save what you can. Then, ask yourself from time to time, at what age will I be able to afford to retire?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RRSP contributions are an example of the kind of cost you don't have once you're retired. Do retirees typically spend less than working people?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Way less. Families have two really high expenses during their working lives that they don't have in retirement. One is paying for things that they'll acquire in their working lives like houses. The second thing is children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's say I'm rapidly approaching age 65 and I know I haven't saved enough for retirement. What are my best options?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most powerful lever you have as you approach retirement isn't your savings rate. It's retirement age. You could try to configure things so that you work part-time for 10 years in retirement and earn a decent amount of money to try and cover some of the shortfall in your savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What will retirement look like for one of the country's foremost thinkers on retirement?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm regularly asked what my plan is, and I deliberately don't have much of a plan. I've had lots of plans in my life and it might be nice to have a period that is less planned.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Writers are turning to be-your-own-business models when setting out to produce a book. Some of them are avoiding publishers by raising their own money on websites such as Kickstarter. You ask people to make pledges of their choosing; in return they get a copy of the book, and other gifts if they pledge a high amount.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key to raising money in this way is social media: You advertise your Kickstarter page by developing extensive social networks online. Authors who are used to conventional arrangements – a publisher who does all this work for you – have been worried that the trend will pressure them all into being fundraisers and advertisers rather than luxuriously isolated thinkers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But recently a writer/illustrator broke $1-million in pledges on Kickstarter – probably more than a publisher would have given him as an advance. (This was for Rich Burlew's comic The Order of the Stick.) Burlew was already a popular artist with a large online social network, and it's a comic book, not a collection of Canadian short stories, but still this has got us all thinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Closer to home, a Kickstarter success story has also shown how a concerted use of social media can harness political opinion to create a modestly expensive hardcover art book. It's a children's book, called What Makes a Baby, the project of a Toronto-based sex educator and writer called Cory Silverberg. The drawings will be by renowned Canadian illustrator Fiona Smyth. It sounds like another helpful guide for parents who want to explain to four- to eight-year-olds where babies come from, but this one has a twist. It explains baby-making in an open and neutral way that allows parents to include, in their reading of the book to their children, all the modern options: adoption, surrogates, in vitro fertilization and so on. Silverberg writes on his Kickstarter page: “… the truth is that more and more of us are acknowledging the help we get to bring children into our lives.” The goal is to help parents describe a widely inclusive world of reproduction and a variety of family types.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is such a good idea one wonders why there aren't a shelf full of kids' books on this subject already and why Silverberg didn't just go to a big publisher and ask for a large advance. He told me in an interview that he thought major publishers would think it a fringe project and not worth their while. Also he wanted total control of the content.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silverberg initially set a goal of $9,500. He was thinking of an initial print-run of 1,000 copies. He worked hard on the Kickstarter pitch: There is a professional video about the content and the illustrator, information about the physical specifications of the book, the name of the designer, even of the printer. He prepared this for four months before he launched it, and then went about getting people to look at it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results were quick and astounding: In the first week he raised more than $35,000 – more than three times his goal. So, how did he do it? One word: <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. Last week I saw about four links to the site posted by friends. <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, says Silverberg, made more sense as a publicity device than Twitter: “<span class="companylink">Facebook</span> is for parents – it's where we post pictures of our kids.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is something else at work here too, and that's the chance for people to make an ideological statement. This book is going to be controversial, particularly in the religious parts of the United States, where it is going to be seen as dangerously permissive. By pledging money to making it, people are taking a stand not just for one particular book but for the ideas in it. It's almost like joining a political party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Silverberg has more money than he asked for, he can increase the print run and drive down the cost per book – and, he says, donate more books to libraries and community groups. He is going to have to do lots of grunt work to warehouse and ship this book – something most writers don't have time for. So it's not a model for all of us. But it does show that a diffuse crowd usually preoccupied with jokes and food can be yoked together and directed to actually create something artistic. And that people will vote, in a way, on a new book's content before it is finished.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Stephen Harper is right to be deeply concerned about Iran, but his recent statements go too far. He has asserted that Iran's leaders would have “no hesitation” about using nuclear weapons. If this is your view, then negotiations don't make much sense – better to invoke the 1930s and advocate confrontation. Despite denials, the Prime Minister seems to be preparing Canadians to support a military strike against Iran's nuclear program.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is this where Canada should be positioned? Certainly, the Prime Minister is working closely with our allies, but there is still quite a difference between his statements and those of U.S. President Barack Obama. Mr. Obama has taken no options off the table but is working toward a negotiated solution; Mr. Harper seems to be tilting in a different direction. This is the first time in decades that a Canadian prime minister, Liberal or Conservative, appears to be advocating approaches that reduce diplomatic opportunities for peace during an international crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One such opportunity, an initiative by Turkey and Brazil, almost reached a breakthrough. In 2010, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and then-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva flew to Tehran and negotiated a deal to move a significant portion of Iran's enriched uranium offshore for reprocessing. They had a prior understanding with Washington about what might be acceptable and came very close to delivering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the few weeks that it took them to convince Tehran, the situation in Washington changed and the political room Mr. Obama had for deal-making shifted. The peace initiative failed, but could still be resuscitated in modified form when Iran returns to the negotiating table in Turkey next month. This is the type of middle-power diplomacy that Canada has practised with skill and success in the past; we should be there now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is another aspect to what Ottawa is advocating that should give cause for concern. After an attack, Iranian leaders would almost surely close down the human-rights movement as they rallied their country's population. And yet it is precisely this movement that offers the most long-term hope for Iran to emerge from isolation and rejoin the international community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, support for human rights has been a fundamental principle of our policy on Iran. We have led successive UN votes condemning its human-rights record; we draw attention to specific cases of abuse, particularly ones involving our own dual citizens; and we provide refuge for Iranians who want to leave. We should not abandon them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under present circumstances, there is virtually no chance that the United Nations Security Council will support military action against Iran, but yet this has not swayed advocates of a strike. Canada will have a choice: We can remain faithful to the system of collective security under the UN charter that we helped to create, or we can support a pre-emptive war undertaken without full international legitimacy. We chose the first option in 2003, despite considerable risk to our relationship with the United States, when it launched a pre-emptive war against Iraq. We should re-main true to our principles now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, even advocates of a military strike admit that it would not stop Iran's nuclear program. At best, it would delay it. Indeed, many analysts believe it would make weaponization of Iran's nuclear program inevitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are four suggestions for the Canadian government:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Tone down the rhetoric. In particular, make clear to Iran's people that we do not support demonizing their country – our concern is with their leaders' policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Speak up for human rights in Iran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Inform Israel that Canada wants a negotiated solution to the crisis and will not support unilateral military action. Our support for Israel should not be unconditional.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Encourage Israel to resume the peace process with the Palestinians and re-engage with its neighbours, particularly our NATO ally, Turkey. (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be in Ottawa on March 2.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iran's leaders have done many abhorrent things, but they are neither irrational nor suicidal. They are best understood as leaders of a failed revolution who are now preoccupied with self-preservation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada can play a bigger role in enhancing the cohesion and unity of the international community at a time when it's essential for Iran to engage in meaningful negotiations to resolve the crisis.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good though it is that Canada and China have now reached a bilateral investment-protection agreement, Canadian companies also need to protect their own investments abroad, by applying proper auditing standards when they carry on business in China – and in other countries with commercial cultures that are markedly different from Canada's.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CPAB – which has certain disciplinary powers – examined 24 Canadian public companies that have their main operations in China.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The board says that “the primary root cause” of these problems “is a failure to understand the business customs and practices” of China and other foreign countries, and that “the barriers to effective communications extend beyond language to include business etiquette, social expectations and personal relationships.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a 30-year-old dream that's finally coming true. Sort of.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the first Canadian pay-TV channels launched in the early 1980s, plenty of viewers mistakenly believed they were going be able to watch the same movies that were playing down at the local multiplex. They didn't realize that the movie-distribution business operated according to a very rigid set of rules which meant films wouldn't appear on pay-TV for at least a year after hitting theatres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, though, movie fans will be able to enjoy the blockbuster Australian film Tomorrow When the War Began at home on the very same day it hits theatres: through iTunes ($4.99 for a high-definition stream), on their cable-TV video-on-demand channel ($6.99 for HD), and on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> ($5), followed by a DVD release next Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sorry, I should clarify: U.S. audiences will have those options. Canadian moviegoers will remain, um, movie-goers: They'll have to actually go to the theatre. (It is currently scheduled for release on this side of the border in May.) And some distributors say that's directly because of the dominance of Cineplex Entertainment, which last year had a 66-per-cent share of the Canadian theatrical exhibition market, and its powerful CEO Ellis Jacob. (Cineplex's closest competitor, <span class="companylink">Empire Theatres</span>, holds about 13 per cent.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What Ellis says, goes here [in Canada],” said Berry Meyerowitz, the president and CEO of the independent Toronto-based distributor Phase 4 Films, which does far more of its business in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The multiplatform premiere of Tomorrow is the broadest example yet of the shifting power dynamic between the old-guard movie-theatre chains and the exploding number of players in the film-exhibition business. It's a very touchy subject in the United States: Last year, when a handful of big studios shrank the usual 90-day window that theatre circuits have to themselves by releasing some films early on DVD and video-on-demand, the National Association of Theatre Owners blasted back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The backlash carried all the force that the association's military acronym NATO might suggest. Many theatre chains said they would not accept a movie slated for early DVD or VOD release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an e-mail on Wednesday, Cineplex reinforced its own position. “Cineplex would not show a movie that would be going to [premium VOD] earlier than the traditional windows,” said Pat Marshall, vice-president of communications and investor relations for Cineplex Entertainment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A growing number of distributors believe that's closed-minded: Bad not just for them, but also for movie audiences. Sports teams, after all, learned long ago that some people are happy to spend big bucks to attend live events, even as others take in the games for free on TV. (And the cost of TV rights have soared.) More distribution channels usually mean more money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the United States, the independent distributors IFC and Magnolia have successfully been offering their quirky films for on-demand purchase over cable and satellite TV systems on the same day they premiere in theatres, putting smiles on the faces of all the hipsters who couldn't make it out of their apartments. (Yup, hipsters are new parents too.) Magnolia actually offers something called ultra-VOD, premiering its movies online and on cable about a month before they hit theatres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they can afford to take that route because their parent companies also own cable channels and movie theatres, so they don't need to worry about being locked out of other distribution channels. In any case, the U.S. cinema scene is more splintered, with no single player dominating the way Cineplex does in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another indie player, Lionsgate, specifically cited video-on-demand as a key to the success of the independent Wall Street drama Margin Call, which was released in theatres and on VOD at the same time last fall. “This will be a very profitable movie for us due to the low marketing expenses and multiple day-and-date revenue sources,” Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer said in a conference call last November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A profitable movie, satisfied exhibitors, and hundreds of thousands of happy fans who got to watch a great new film in the comfort of home: It almost sounds like a dream. Which, for Canadian movie audiences, it will remain.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the list of missions accomplished in the first half of the Toronto Raptors' schedule, getting Jose Calderon to play up his trade value must surely be at the top.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet when general manager Bryan Colangelo and head coach Dwane Casey and his staff do their blue-skying for next season, and figure out the point-guard what-ares in the coming draft, the trade might-bes and free-agent possibilities, they may well reach an obvious conclusion: The Raptors might be best served keeping Calderon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're trying to hold on to him and keep him, but he has played his way into a very high status as a point guard,” Casey said Wednesday, before the Raptors beat the Detroit Pistons 103-93 to hit the half-way point of the NBA's condensed 66-game regular-season schedule with a .303 winning percentage (10-23.) “A lot of teams have been calling and wanting him.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Casey's task was straight-forward heading into this season. He was to teach defence to a whole team of unbelievers, make sure that DeMar DeRozan and Ed Davis continued to develop, figure out what he had in odds and ends such as Amir Johnson, James Johnson and Jerryd Bayless, see if Andrea Bargnani has any backbone to his game – and make sure Calderon played up his trade value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unstated, yet very much hoped for, was that they be just bad enough to hit the motherlode in the draft lottery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet something happened over the course of the Raptors' seven-game homestand, during which they went 2-5. Calderon went off, averaging 16.7 points, 11.1 assists and just under 35 minutes, including setting career highs in points (30) and field goals (13) in a loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. Wednesday, he had 15 assists for the second time on the homestand, to go along with six points. He is, as Casey noted, one of the Raptors' best shooters but he has also had more ups than downs defensively. “Last year was just a parade of paint points starting with him and then the big guy,” Casey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not so in 2011-12. Yes, Casey has managed culture change. It was noticeable as early as the first home game, a bruising 90-85 loss to the Indiana Pacers, when Pacers all-star Roy Hibbert called the Raptors a different team. Bargnani was an early-season revelation until a strained calf caused him to miss 20 of the past 22 games, DeRozan has been inconsistent but Wednesday's gem is a nice memory to carry into the second half: 23 points including 9-for-15 from the field and a growing balance between his jump shots and attacking the rim. Davis is still a work in progress but, with another off-season of added bulk, can at least be a usable sixth man. James Johnson is carving out a role for himself and Aaron Gray may be in the process of doing so, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which brings us to the 30-year-old Calderon, who has one year and $10,561,985 (U.S.) remaining on his contract. There are Raptors fans who would have taken the Pistons' Brandon Knight fifth overall in the draft instead of the big Lithuanian Jonas Valanciunas. But Knight, who had 16 points Wednesday, went eighth and isn't exactly a pure point guard, and the fact is that this draft is deep in every area but the point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So if the Raptors do end up in the lottery, any point guard they'd take would be a horrible reach. Trade for a point guard? With what? Calderon – another point guard? Free agency doesn't offer a great deal either. Deron Williams isn't coming here. Beyond that? There isn't much.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Facebook</span> photos and Pinterest boards are daubs on the cave wall. The typical batch of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> photos are crude ceremonial assertions of a person's tribe and the ritual of debauched gatherings. Look: me with my posse getting wasted/celebrating mom's birthday/spouse's promotion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is Pinterest, with its emphasis on pride in people's stuff and the lust after stuff, but a perfect expression of a contemporary hunter-gatherer culture?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If not back to the cave, then at least back to a more primitive existence. Recently, I read an astute observation that <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> has replaced the church as a recorder of important events in people's lives. Births, engagements, marriages, all the benchmark incidents of existence, once dutifully part of church records, are now noted mainly on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. In the future, it will seem that we went backward. What is a Tweet but a grunt compared with the expansive writing of letters, notes, pamphlets of point of view expounding on issues?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We think that technology improves us and our lives. We forget that every apparent step forward can, in truth, be a walk back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which brings us to pornography. After every advance in communication technology comes pornography. This pattern is repeated. As soon as cavemen drew, they drew about sex. As soon as the printing press made the mass production of books possible, it made mass porn possible. What was submerged, hidden or in the shadows suddenly emerges into the light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sext up KIDS (CBC, 9 p.m. on Doc Zone) is an alarmist new documentary about teen and tweens “trying to navigate their way through an X-rated culture.” Much of it is about the sexualization of young girls and teenagers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is much talk of our “hypersexualized society” and we see the predictable examples of that society exemplified. Young girls going to school dressed in a highly sexualized way. In the doc, teenage girls talk about the terrible things other girls and boys say to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're told that boys expect porn-star looks and attitude from girls because, well, boys have 24/7 access to pornography. We're told that 70 to 80 per cent of teenage boys watch online porn regularly: “The Internet makes porn affordable, accessible and anonymous and just so easy for boys to find their favourite sites.” Thus, young boys acquire a distorted idea of sex. And girls know what the boys watch and want. Young girls are under pressure to deliver porn-star performances in relationships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Computer-mediated communication tends to accelerate intimacy,” an expert says. The same expert asserts that young girls who text the most are also the most likely to experiment sexually. Now there's a statistic to terrify parents. And then there's the revelation that the number of teenage girls who send nude or semi-nude photos of themselves to a crush is staggering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We hear about what results sometimes: Kids who have shared sexy pictures of other kids under the age of 18 have been charged with possession of child pornography.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sext up KIDS, made by Maureen Palmer of Bountiful Films, sets out to expose how growing up in a hypersexualized culture “hurts our kids.” It suggests that, but doesn't really prove it. It's a fascinating but muddled documentary. On the one hand, it points to mainstream media and pop culture as a source for the sexualization of youth. On the other hand, it seems to suggest that the kids are okay, that for all the barrage of blatant messages and the successful selling of porn imagery, most kids can figure out how to cope and navigate this world that is so alien to their parents. In the end, it suggests that boys and girls still want romance, affection and companionship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What it fails to suggest is that the Internet and digital telecommunications – the source of so much angst in the doc – return us to tribalism and the coarse narcissism of self-regard. Kids are obsessed with photos of themselves online. Adults create ever-smaller tribal groups online and create altars to themselves. LinkedIn profiles. Pinterest boards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the porn that can be found so easily now by kids and adults, digital technology creates its own pornography of narcissism. Hence the ease with which the old patterns of growth, maturity and aging are undermined, for all age groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, as the doc proposes, things are screwed up. We grow cruder, not wiser and better from the connection-saturation culture of the digital world. Adults go back to the cave, and take the kids with them.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor of Toronto</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto is one of the most congested cities in North America, something that costs our economy $6-billion every year, according to the Toronto Board of Trade. The impact on families is just as bad. The average Toronto commute is 24 minutes longer than in Los Angeles: That's 100 hours a year better spent playing with children, exercising or even working a little longer to save for vacation. This is a quality of life issue, not just an economic one.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major transit systems in Toronto are built and managed by the <span class="companylink">Toronto Transit Commission</span>, an organization that came into its own in the 1940s with the construction of its first subway. Today, the TTC is a designated essential service moving more than 1.5 million customers a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TTC is a jewel in Toronto's crown – but it has lost its shine. It has become a large, inefficient organization. Just over a year ago, I told the TTC it needed to make serious improvements. I wanted to see cleaner vehicles, subway stations and better customer service over all. While the TTC has made some changes, real improvement requires top-down leadership. It's not just another project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TTC's core business model was developed at a time when federal and provincial governments provided major operating subsidies. Rightly or wrongly, that time is over. It's time for the organization to undertake a complete rethink of its mission, vision and fundamental business model. The TTC needs to reduce its cost base while maximizing the value of its real-estate assets, its retail opportunities and its licensing opportunities. In short, a new leader is required to reshape the TTC and move it forward with a vision that will serve Toronto to the end of this century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TTC must become a sustainable, world-class transit system that connects people with jobs, homes, families and recreation. It must be rapid and reliable. Operational excellence should produce superior customer satisfaction and outstanding efficiency. This will attract new riders out of their cars, reducing congestion and commuting times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I passionately believe a world-class city builds world-class rapid transit. Toronto's old “Transit City” plan, with projected vehicle speeds only slightly faster than buses, was never planned to be rapid. Subways will make Toronto a world-leading 21st-century city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A hundred years from now, Toronto will have more subway lines providing reliable high-speed transportation for millions more people. The only real question is whether we will start building those subways now, or wait another 20 years and build them at 10 times the cost. Inevitably, though, we will have subways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I believe we should start building subways now. And we shouldn't stop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We can afford subways. Gordon Chong's recent report on the Sheppard subway identifies a number of revenue sources, including development charges and tax increment financing. His estimates are conservative and many industry sources say these can produce more revenue than he projects. Dr. Chong also identifies a number of additional revenue tools that can fill in any funding gap that may exist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to KPMG, a modest parking levy could generate more than $90-million annually. That would fund a public-private partnership model to build the Sheppard subway and generate ongoing revenue for future subway expansion. Some partnership models don't require any taxpayer funding in the first few years. Parking revenue during those years could fund early implementation of a bus rapid transit solution in the Finch corridor. With such funding available, Toronto should move forward with a Sheppard subway plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a revitalized, modernized TTC and a commitment to start building subways now and keep on building them, Toronto will continue as Canada's economic engine. In fact, Toronto can become the world's preferred city for raising a family, building a business and enjoying an urban vacation. The time to start is now.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was the day the experts never imagined.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late February, Game No. 896 of the 2011-12 NHL season, and the Capital Cup turned upside down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back before the puck dropped on Game No. 1, every expert from the hallowed Hockey News to the slurring caller to the late-night talk show predicted the <span class="companylink">Washington Capitals</span> would be the class of the Eastern Conference, would win the President's Trophy and, in all likelihood, move on to play for the Stanley Cup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ottawa Senators, on the other hand, would come dead last, the experts decreed. Maybe second-dead last, but dead all the same. It would be the price to be paid for the near total dismantling of a very bad team and a decision to start again from all but scratch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listen, though, to the owners speak this week. <span class="companylink">Washington Capitals</span> owner Ted Leonsis first, on his team's 5-0 loss Monday to the lowly Carolina Hurricanes: “Worst game of the season. …We came up small when we needed to come up big. … An unacceptable performance.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now hear Eugene Melnyk, owner of the Ottawa Senators, on his 21-year-old defenceman Erik Karlsson, who leads all NHL defencemen in scoring by about three touchdowns and is almost certain to be a finalist for the Norris Trophy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karlsson, Melnyk predicted on a Toronto radio station, will “go down in history as one of the greatest defencemen of all time.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Young Karlsson didn't know what to say when asked about standing with the likes of Shore, Harvey, Orr, Bourque, Niedermayer et al: “I mean, I still have a pretty long way to go in my career.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then he quietly skated out onto the ice at Scotiabank Place, scored the Senators' first goal, set up the second and third and generally mesmerized as the predicted-last-place Senators steamrolled over the predicted-first-place Capitals 5-2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karlsson's 47 assists set a franchise record, with 20 games still to play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senators, with the win, stand at 32-22-8 for 72 points, the Capitals at 29-26-5 for 63 points. The Senators are challenging the 2011 Stanley Cup champions, the Boston Bruins, for top spot in their division. The Capitals have fallen out of the playoffs at the moment, having lost six of their past seven games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Capitals are a mess. They changed coaches – Dale Hunter for Bruce Boudreau – and their record worsened, Boudreau's record at firing 12-9-1, Hunter's now 17-17-4 in a league where, in the days of three-point games, .500 hockey is not good enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alexander Ovechkin, once the most thrilling player in the game, is struggling through his worst season with 24 goals and 21 assists and didn't even play Wednesday night, saying he didn't “feel well” while his coach, Hunter, claimed the player had “a lower-body injury.” Ovechkin seems, to many, to have lost the spark that so ignited the hockey world these past several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senators are so far from a mess that head coach Paul MacLean pronounced, rather grandly, that, “Our team doesn't have any holes.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On this night, it certainly seemed to be true. The two teams had already played three times this season, with Washington winning all three games. But that was then and this is now, Ovechkin off when he plays and out this night, slick centre Nicklas Backstrom out with injury the past 22 games, playmaking defenceman Mike Green just returned from long-term injury and slowly finding his game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only that, but goaltending has been a problem – Vokoun finally chased from his net after allowing four goals on 11 Ottawa shots and replaced with Michal Neuvirth, who had struggled against the Carolina Hurricanes two nights earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington scored on a third-period power play when defenceman John Carlson slammed home a nice Alexander Semin pass past Craig Anderson. Later in the period, Mathieu Perreault scored with his face when he deflected in a Jason Chimera shot. And Ottawa's Nick Foligno finished off the scoring with an empty-net marker in the dying moments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In past years,” Chimera said earlier of the Carolina loss, “we could afford to have a game like that. This year we can't.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now they had another – but still close enough to a final playoff berth that, as the Senators have proved this oddball season, anything is possible.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The B.C. government was putting the final touches on its latest budget when economist Don Drummond released his report into the Ontario government's fiscal difficulties.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. Finance Minister Kevin Falcon said Mr. Drummond's forensic audit, and the tough prescriptions that flowed from it, convinced him that the tough, restraint-minded budget he was planning was right for the times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think the Drummond report is a real warning signal for governments across the country that if we lose discipline in controlling spending, if we think we can spend our way out of temporary short-term problems, we leave a legacy of debt and deficit to our children that is going to result in them paying a very big price,” Mr. Falcon told me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not since Paul Revere has a warning call been talked about as much as the alarm Don Drummond sounded. Even B.C. Premier Christy Clark acknowledged that the report made it easier for her government to bring in the tough-minded budget it did Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the budget lock-up, there weren't many who didn't mention Mr. Drummond's review in the context of the influence it is likely to have across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is little doubt that the [Drummond] report is going to have a major impact on fiscal policy discussions in Canada at the sub-national level,” said noted B.C. economist Jock Finlayson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Ontario has now become a case study of what happens when you let spending growth outstrip the pace of your tax base. Now they're in a terrible fiscal hole and only draconian measures are going to get them out of it. I think the Drummond report was a huge wake-up call for some provinces.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are now officially in an era of restraint – at least some of us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you live in Alberta and Saskatchewan, it's pretty much business as usual. They're awash in money. Those living in Ontario and Quebec haven't felt the effect of government belt-tightening either, but not because their governments are rich – because they've been politically timid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone is now well aware of the difficult choices that lie ahead for Ontario. Quebec won't be far behind. Its debt problems are worse than Ontario's, yet no one seems to be talking about them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But elsewhere in the country, debt is a concern, and thanks to Mr. Drummond, it has become an even bigger one. Manitoba's debt-to-GDP ratio is around 26 per cent. Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island have debt ratios of 36 per cent – similar to Ontario's. Newfoundland has money and has been running surpluses and yet still has a debt-to-GDP ratio of nearly 27 per cent. B.C.'s will be 18 per cent in two years before it begins trending downward again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, globally, we're still pikers. Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio is 228 per cent. Greece is almost stable by comparison at 144 per cent; France's debt ratio is 83 per cent and the U.K.'s is 76 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Drummond has helped make debt a very dirty word in Canada – as it should be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're trying to avoid the problems Ontario has on its hands right now,” Mr. Falcon said. “And I think other provinces are going to be facing similar problems as Ontario. The thing is, it doesn't take very long before you end up like a France or a U.K. That can happen in 10 years very, very quickly.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a recent party my spouse and I met a couple we liked immediately, even though they are 25 years our juniors. After, I e-mailed an invitation to dinner. Six days later, with apologies for the tardy reply (“crazy week”), they said yes to the following Saturday. But one day before, they e-mailed to say they couldn't make it. Next Saturday was the same: They said yes, then cancelled, saying they had accidentally double-booked. The wife suggested we pick a day that “would be cast in stone.” At this point I felt I should back off. I sent a jokey e-mail saying maybe we should forget it, but if they were ever in our area (they moved from the United Kingdom to about an hour away from us, in rural Nova Scotia) they should pop by. We have not heard from them since. Did we screw up? Is this our introduction to ageism?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not sure what's going on. Ageism, rudeness, confusion – hard to tell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I do know it's painful to want to be friends with a person who doesn't necessarily return that interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To think to myself: “Oooh, there's a really cool guy/girl/couple. I'd love to hang out with him/her/them.” Only to slowly perceive he/she/they may not find me, David Eddie, all that fascinating (hard to imagine, I know!).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">L. Rust Hills, in his classic book How to Do Things Right (which covers with curmudgeonly glee everything from the proper way to eat an ice cream cone to the complexities of conducting an extramarital affair), explains this phenomenon with his “Social Cruel Rule #3”:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Uninteresting people invite you to their house; you do not invite them back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. You invite interesting people to your house; they do not invite you back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It follows that “interesting people who don't invite you back must know even more interesting people who don't invite them back, and those people never get invited back by even more interesting people, and so on up the chain.” Going the other way, he says “the uninteresting people you don't invite back must know even more uninteresting people they don't invite back, and so on. Somewhere down there it must be very dull indeed, and the person at the bottom is forced to give up.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think there's some truth to these statements, but I don't think it's necessarily so straightforward and hierarchical an arrangement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm sure a lot of people will tell you to write these chumps off. They are, after all, being rather rude and disrespectful. (I don't accept “busy” or “crazy week” as an excuse not to return e-mails.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I prefer to take an overview: This could possibly just be a series of goofy glitches you will all look back on in 20 years when you're great friends and munching on lobsters and drinking champers as the sun sets over the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I feel like I've always been maximally honest in this column, but now I'm going to reveal something that is truly painful and embarrassing for me to admit in print – and which I'm aware probably makes me look pathetic – but what the hell:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I meet interesting people who rebuff, or appear to be indifferent to, my friendly overtures, I continue to seek their friendship anyway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, yeah. I phone them. I e-mail them. I wear them down, coming at them with a “charm offensive” until they knuckle under, say “uncle,” and submit to the inevitable: becoming my friend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This approach is based on a nexus of truths I consider to be self-evident: 1) people, even the most interesting, are generally passive and will eventually do your bidding if you pressure them long enough; 2) it's fun having friends; 3) it's hard making friends as an adult; 4) the company of interesting people is preferable to the company of boring people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But listen, this isn't advice per se. I'm not saying everyone should follow my (somewhat tragic) example. It depends how badly you want these people as friends, how badly you want friends at all, where your draw the line vis-à-vis manners, etc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bottom line: You have telephones, I presume, in rural Nova Scotia. Why not give these fascinating slightly boorish Brits a second chance? Ring them up, arrange a “carved in stone” date, and I tell you what: If they blow you off this time, you have my permission not only to give them the kiss-off but also a piece of your mind while you're at it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if they do show up? Either you have a great time and decide it was worth all the glitches, or you realize that they're bores and you were bamboozled by their oh-so-sophisticated-sounding accents (which happens: Brits get away with murder with those accents, if you ask me).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either way, you win.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Eddie is the author of Damage Control, the book</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, while British Columbia's premier-designate Christy Clark was waiting to collect the keys to her new office, she sketched out her “families first” agenda for government. It had been the central theme of her leadership bid, and she was ready to get to work to help families get ahead. A key promise was to hold the line on taxes.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This Sunday is the first anniversary of her election to leader of the B.C. Liberal Party. The first Clark budget was unveiled on Tuesday, an opportunity to put her priorities into play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And here is what she did: Increase the tax burden on families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A middle-class family of four can expect to pay up to $187 more this year. Low-income families don't catch a break either, with their tax bill rising by $152. And those figures do not include higher fees for services from Crown corporations such as <span class="companylink">BC Hydro</span>, <span class="companylink">BC Ferries</span> and the Insurance Corp. of B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, asked how that squares with her tax commitment, she fell back on an old refrain: “We are not raising income taxes on people.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is true – medical service premiums and the carbon tax went up instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And by Ms. Clark's own definition, income tax levels are not the best measure to determine if government is helping families get ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“One of the things that government needs to start doing is, rather than just talking about where our tax rates are,” she said last March, is to look at “where are we in terms of the total burden of costs that government puts on citizens.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberal government of premier Gordon Campbell was content to coast on its low personal income taxes. Ms. Clark distanced herself from that approach. She said she would ensure that medical service premiums, electricity rates and other government-levied costs would be examined through a new lens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking at the whole package, she said, B.C. is only in the middle of the pack among the provinces. She promised a fresh approach when weighing taxes in the future: “When a decision comes before cabinet, we will ask: How does this affect B.C. families?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The budget Finance Minister Kevin Falcon tabled this week wasn't a families budget. “This budget is about fiscal discipline,” he said as he introduced the plan. The big theme was digging B.C. out of deficit and maintaining a healthy investment climate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview this week, Ms. Clark said that fits with her agenda over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our approach is to try to protect the interests of families in the long term by doing everything I can to enable the creation of jobs,” she said. “Because when families are working, that's when they are strongest.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her holistic approach to taxation hasn't been abandoned, she said. It is proving difficult to implement. “We are looking at the total burden on families, but the thing is … I don't get to control that entirely.” She pointed to an order last week by <span class="companylink">BC Hydro</span>'s regulator for a rate hike in April that almost doubles the increase the government had recommended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her long-term approach isn't a departure – in her leadership campaign, Ms. Clark stressed the need to eliminate the deficit, and said any big tax cuts would have to wait. It is more an issue of emphasis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It does, however, skirt her leadership campaign promise to phase in a working income tax benefit as part of a poverty reduction plan. “The families-first agenda recognizes that there are British Columbians who are not able to share in our prosperity,” Ms. Clark's official platform stated. “There are families in every part of the province who cannot afford three meals a day and who send their children to school hungry.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her first act in office was to hike the minimum wage. But no tax credit for the working poor was unveiled in this week's budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You want a poverty plan? Enable the creation of good, middle-class jobs,” Ms. Clark said this week. “That's the best poverty plan any province or any country can have.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Clark's tax rationalizations earned a rebuttal from Adrian Dix, leader of the opposition New Democratic Party, one designed to cut to the bone: “Christy Clark is sounding more like Gordon Campbell every day.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changes to provincial budgets often happen so slowly over time that citizens often don't realize what's happened.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are exceptions, as when premier Gordon Campbell's B.C. government introduced a carbon tax in 2008. In 2011-12, that $30-a-tonne tax will bring in $960-million. True to the government's word, all of it is being recycled into lower taxes elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally, however, headlines reflect noticeable changes, whereas more important longer-term trends are obscured. So it was this week with the latest B.C. budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Christy Clark's decision to raise the corporate tax rate by one point in two years made news. The change will yield about $200-million a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, over the next three years, the province's health budget will grow by $1.5-billion. The increase presumes a herculean effort to keep health care growing at only 3 per cent a year, something no province has managed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sixty per cent of B.C.'s new spending over the next three years ($1.5-billion of $2.5-billion) will be for health care. As such, this budget is a template for what's happening across Canada: health-care über alles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What happens to every other department when health care takes so much? Budgets are either cut in absolute terms or in real terms – that is, after inflation. Those cuts are made even though the B.C. government is raising health-care premiums (a form of tax) so that they will bring in $360-million more in three years, and raising the corporate tax rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drip-drip of health care spending über alles can be seen another way. In the B.C. budget, a document shows government expenses since 2005-2006, then projected to 2014-2015, a period of nine fiscal years. During that period, health care spending will have risen at 4.9 per cent yearly (after inflation) compared to 3.3 per cent for education and 3.4 per cent for social services. That gap doesn't seem like much in a year, but multiply that gap over nine years, and it yawns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nine years ago, health care was 38 per cent of B.C.'s operating expenses. At the end of the period, it will be 42.2 per cent, assuming the herculean restraint projected for the next three years. And while health care rises to 42.2 per cent, everything else falls as a share of provincial spending (except transportation). Per capita, health care rises from $2,950 to $4,106, whereas education rises from $2,124 to $2,510.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. is lucky in one sense: It will have a budgetary surplus next year, in contrast to Ontario and Quebec. In those provinces, a much worse fiscal position intensifies pressure on spending – especially in Ontario, where the deficit is large and Premier Dalton McGuinty has ruled out tax increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. does share Ontario's goal of holding health increases to 3 per cent a year, although Ontario commissioner Don Drummond recommends 2.5 per cent. Both provinces will have their hands full, because curbing spending where providers defend their turf is exceptionally difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider B.C.'s K-12 education budget: Enrolment of students is down, but costs are not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or its justice budget: There has been a 33-per-cent decline in provincial criminal court cases over the past six years. (Is the Harper government, with its “tough on crime” agenda, listening?) And yet, according to the budget, adult criminal justice costs have increased by 35 per cent despite “improvements and the implementation of a number of reform initiatives to increase efficiencies and alleviate pressures.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Court cases down by a third; costs up by a third. Go figure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason, the government says, is “the entrenched culture and the traditions of the system.” The same words could be used to describe the health care, K-12 and university systems, which explain in part why these are so hard to change and why efficiency gains, the panacea of reformers everywhere, are so difficult to achieve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These B.C. trends were below the headlines, but they are apparent across the country. Health care eats up a larger share of budgets at the expense of other programs. Efficiency gains are sought everywhere but achieved with difficulty. Everywhere but Alberta, taxes have to pay for health care while balancing budgets.</p>
