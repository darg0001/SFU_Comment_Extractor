<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miikka Kiprusoff's NHL career began in the <span class="companylink">San Jose Sharks</span> organization – and it may well have ended there, in non-descript fashion, but for the events of Grey Cup Sunday in 2003.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Calgary Flames were casting about for goaltending help – again – and kicked the tires on a number of possibilities. But Darryl Sutter did what NHL general managers so often do and went for the familiar, a guy buried in his previous organization's depth chart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sharks made Kiprusoff the odd man out, instead keeping Evgeni Nabokov and Vesa Toskala, and in return received a second-round draft choice in 2005 that was used on Marc-Édouard Vlasic, a serviceable NHL defenceman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Kiprusoff went on to become a star, and the Sharks ultimately rued the day they traded him to a rival, as it was Kiprusoff who backstopped the Flames to an upset victory over San Jose in the 2004 Western Conference final. The Sharks have not come closer to winning the Stanley Cup. For that matter, Calgary hasn't gone any deeper in the playoffs since that memorable run, but it's not because of Kiprusoff, who relentlessly, year after year, props up an average team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, some 81/2 years later, Kiprusoff returns to San Jose on Wednesday, seeking to become just the 27th goaltender in NHL history to record 300 wins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kiprusoff, 35, is quiet, almost painfully shy, so getting anything beyond the rudimentary observations out of him is difficult. But such a milestone clearly doesn't mean as much as career victory No. 277, which came in the opening week of the season against the Montreal Canadiens. It pushed Kiprusoff past Mike Vernon to become the Flames' all-time wins leader, now 285 and counting. (He had previously recorded 14 victories with the Sharks.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That night, Kiprusoff talked about his gratitude towards the Flames for rescuing him from the goalie glut in San Jose that had him thinking about returning to Finland. Calgary turned out to be the perfect fit, a chance to be the defined starter, but he made the most of his opportunity, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kiprusoff, according to winger Alex Tanguay, “gives you a chance to win on a nightly basis. This is my fourth season with the Flames and I don't think I've seen him play better. He's been outstanding all year. He's kept us in games. He's made the big save and he's made the timely save. He's been fun to watch and, hopefully, he keeps it going.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kiprusoff rarely gives up a bad goal and has an unflappable presence. Post-to-post, there are few who move quicker or anticipate better. In terms of flexibility, Kiprusoff is right there with Gumby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whenever the Flames go on the road in February, star winger Jarome Iginla is generally the focal point, always obliged to address questions about his future in Calgary. But Kiprusoff poses an interesting case, too, given his age and the six-year, $35-million (U.S.) contract he signed after the 2007-08 season. It was one of the first of the heavily back-loaded, postlockout contracts designed to circumvent the NHL salary cap – and it may also be the first one that comes home to roost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is Year 4 in the deal; and Kiprusoff earns $6-million. Next year, his salary drops to $5-million and the final year is a bargain-basement $1.5-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he signed, it was assumed Kiprusoff, who'll turn 37 at the start of that 2013-14 season, would walk away from the final year and quietly retire. Now? Maybe not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, GM Jay Feaster quietly put a succession plan in place – just in case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the Flames acquired a possible heir apparent, 25-year-old Karri Ramo, from the Tampa Bay Lightning. Ramo is signed to play in Russia through the end of next year – perfect timing for the Flames.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the heart of the HIV disclosure case before the Supreme Court of Canada on Wednesday is the notion that those infected have a right to privacy and autonomy – a right that manifests itself in not having to tell a prospective sex partner that he or she has HIV: If the infected individuals are receiving effective treatment or if they use a condom, it's their right to remain, as it were, silent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a misguided view of individual rights. Autonomy should not give people with incurable illnesses the right to put others at risk. Privacy should not mean that infected individuals may bypass consent, without which sex becomes sexual assault. Rights do not exist in a vacuum. Individuals have obligations, too, and those include the obligation not to physically hurt others, and not to willfully or recklessly spread disease.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HIV advocates say the disease no longer poses a “significant risk of serious bodily harm” – a key phrase in a 1998 Supreme Court case on HIV disclosure before sex. Treatment or condoms should be enough. The Manitoba Court of Appeal accepted this argument in a case now before the Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that 1998 case, the current Chief Justice, Beverley McLachlin, called the failure to disclose HIV infection an act that “shocks the conscience.” Today, the risk of HIV transmission for unprotected sexual intercourse still ranges from 1 in 2,000 to as high as 1 in 384, and condom use, though reducing those numbers further, is also prone to failure. These numbers still mean a “significant risk,” as most informed people would define it. One in 384, over and over again, is a frightening risk with an incurable disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The onus belongs on those infected with HIV, not on their sexual partners. That is an onus that this country's HIV advocates do not want to accept. If their view holds sway, many people would be left exposed to the possibility of life-altering disease, and the vulnerable would be especially at risk. In one of the cases before the Supreme Court, the accused gave alcohol and drugs to low-income aboriginal young women, teenagers and a 12-year-old girl, in exchange for sex. All except the 12-year-old later said they would not have had sex with him had they known his HIV status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The right to give or withhold consent to sexual intercourse is the autonomy issue at stake.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premier of the Sick Man of Canada, Ontario, arrives in the nation's capital Thursday for a major speech. If it's like the speech Premier Dalton McGuinty delivered recently in Toronto, people should turn in their tickets before it's too late.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That speech was a snoozer at a time when Ontario needs a wake-up call. Ontario, once the golden goose of Canada, is laying an economic egg. Its public services cannot be financed at existing levels of taxation. So Ontario borrows a lot of money, and will keep right on borrowing unless serious remedial measures are taken. Either the government gets both smaller and smarter, or taxes must go up – or both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rest of Canada should take note: Ontario is fiscally crippled and will be for some time. This represents the biggest change within Confederation since the discovery of oil in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country's dynamics are changed. Ontario now receives equalization payments and will for the foreseeable future. Not large payments, but payments nonetheless. Symbolically, that says it all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the McGuinty government puts the best gloss possible on the situation. The opposition parties, regrettably, are into puerile populism of the left and right, with the NDP talking about heating oil rebates for seniors and other irrelevancies, and the Conservatives about eliminating toothless regional health authorities as a way to save money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Conference Board of Canada, beholden to no one, has laid it on the line. Its recent report on Ontario's economic and fiscal prospects, combined with economist Don Drummond's report next week (anyone who knows him will anticipate the straight goods), will be a one-two punch against all the illusions, posturing and politicking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board's report starts from a devastating premise: Ontario's real economic growth will be 1.9 per cent, almost a full point below the government's projections. As a result, the government's plan to wipe out the $16-billion deficit by 2017-2018 is already junk bond stuff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government had predicted it could bring health-care spending increases down to 3 per cent and keep them there (something never before done), limit education and social services to a 2-per-cent increases, and restrict everything else to almost zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not any more. Slower growth will mean fewer revenues, which will require cutting everything except health, education and social services by 5 per cent. That would mean cutting, inter alia: roads, public transit, legal aid, culture, agriculture, environment, corporate subsidies and grants, research and development – in short, everything else the government does.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the government stuck to its original plan, it could balance the books, all right – but in a decade. If, as is likely, it were impossible to hold health care increases to 3 per cent – if health care rose at 4.7 per cent – then the budget would not be balanced in 2011-2012 or any time thereafter. And if health care tracked up to 5.6 per cent yearly increases, then to balance the budget by 2017-2018 the provincial sales tax would have to hit 15 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are projections, albeit it highly intelligent ones. Maybe growth will soar well beyond expectations. Maybe Ontario's public institutions will suddenly become vastly more productive. Maybe public-sector unions will accept five to 10 years of restraint. Maybe a surge of innovation will wash over Ontario; after all, it has large universities, a well-educated population and some world-class companies. Maybe the three parties in a minority government will stop posturing and come together in a serious effort to restore Ontario's fiscal situation. Maybe pigs will sprout wings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after years of the McGuinty government adding new programs everywhere – including the latest one to lop 30 per cent off university tuition fees for many full-time students – while the economy kept slumping, ye olde proverbial chickens have come home to roost. Indeed, they arrived some time ago, but the politicians weren't looking, or pretended not to see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so the Sick Man of Canada, and its premier, now has a choice: Speak the truth about what is really happening and prepare people for what must be done; or give a Toronto speech, evasive, bland and political.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the great things about your first visit to Schwartz's in Montreal is that it is as fantastic as every one of your subsequent visits. You wait in a line snaking along St. Laurent Boulevard until you come face to face with a refrigerated window display of stacked briskets. A vapour cloud of steaming meat and spices greets you inside, blanketing your clothing for days. Under bright fluorescent lights, you're seated at a child-sized table, likely with total strangers, as you bathe in the hodgepodge sights of the place – burly carvers under faded photographs, harried waiters shouting orders, the orange sparks of embers from the charcoal grill, a haphazard gallery of yellowed newspaper clippings and snaps of B-list celebrities lining the walls.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incredibly satisfying food never varies: hand-cut fries, tangy coleslaw, garlicky sour pickles. The smoked meat briskets are still slow-cured in barrels over the course of two weeks in a spice rub of salt, garlic, coriander, black pepper and other secret ingredients – pretty much the same way it's been done for 80 years. Smoked on-site, then left to steam for several hours, each brisket is dashed into slices by a few quick flicks of the carver's wrist, then deposited onto small slices of rye bread, slicked with yellow mustard and dropped, steaming and glazed with melted fat, in front of your face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's this experience – so brief, visceral and pure – that's made Schwartz's arguably the most famous restaurant in Canada, capturing the hearts of locals and visitors, French and English, alike. In a world of rapid innovation and vanishing neighbourhoods, Schwartz's remains a constant comfort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when news broke this week of the sale of the delicatessen, the reaction in the comments sections of newspapers, social networks and in private conversations was overwhelmingly fearful. I felt the need to immediately hop on a plane and grab a sandwich. For now, Schwartz's is entering a dangerous period. A change in owners means a change in the rules of the game, and for those of us who love the famed Jewish delicatessen, change is never a good thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hy Diamond, the departing owner who bought the deli in 1999 and sold it for health reasons last week, knew and appreciated that fact. Several years ago, Mr. Diamond told me that his ownership role was primarily stewardship … he was a curator. Though he opened a takeout counter next door in 2008, he left the original in the same condition as he purchased it, and refused, despite overwhelming pressure, to open a second location. Anything else, he said, would dilute Schwartz's magic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has already survived multiple owners, including Reuben Schwartz himself, a reputed gambler and philanderer, who, despite the quality of the smoked meat he began selling in 1928, lost the business several years after opening it due to outstanding gambling debts. Paul Nakis, a Montreal restaurateur and the lead investor in the group that just purchased the deli, says he doesn't plan to change much right away, according to comments made yesterday to The Globe and Mail. Asked about expansion plans, Mr. Nakis said, “There's definitely potential, but we haven't discussed anything like that among us.” In diplomatic language, that means, essentially, everything's on the table. After all, if you pay $10-million (reportedly) for an investment, you expect a return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nakis and his partners could expand the current restaurant or add other locations, produce the meat in a larger, off-site facility and sell it through retail channels, and introduce more products to expand the menu's offerings. (One of Mr. Nakis's partners is Celine Dion's husband, René Angélil, who was a main investor in the Montreal smoked meat chain Nickels, which is to Jewish deli what Coffee Time is to the indie café.) Many delicatessens bought out have done this, though, in almost every case, it has been a disaster for both owners and customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Carnegie and Stage delis in New York flirted with franchises, opening over a dozen locations around the United States in the 1990s. They all failed, diminishing the value of both brands. Toronto's Shopsy's, once the city's corned beef palace, was sold to a number of buyers from the 1960s onward, including <span class="companylink">Unilever</span>, who expanded locations, introduced a line of supermarket products and constantly added new items to the menu to the point where, though Shopsy's still exists in name, deli lovers consider it long gone. In the chase for a few extra points on the profit margin, flavour and the authenticity of a restaurant's identity are the first casualties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, there are other places that have opened up recently in Montreal making smoked meat that is as good or even better. But the value of Schwartz's lies in the fact that it is unchanged; it's one of the last of its kind. Tamper with that, Mr. Nakis, try to improve it and you'll diminish its value, perhaps even ruin it forever. Stay the course, and you'll not only earn back your investment, you'll do your part in preserving this country's most beloved culinary icon.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May I respectfully preface Lucy's recipes with an imperative? Put the champagne on ice before you start prepping. Assuming you'll want bubbly, enjoy a glass before the meal or as a decadent palate cleanser between the salad and hot pot. For the “hearty” salad, try Sancerre, the French sauvignon blanc, with enough citrusy zest to tango with the dressing while putting a crisp bite on the cheesy sandwiches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preferable options for the hot pot include silky Alsatian pinot gris or, better, musky gewürztraminer. These are substantial white wines that deliver up-front fruit and rich texture to counterbalance the piquant dipping sauces. For the fool, consider a floral-grapey, muscat-based dessert wine, such as muscat de Baumes-de-Venise from southern France. A cabernet franc ice wine would work well, too, adding a splash of Valentine red to your meal.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The office mean girl lives! At least where I work. There is a pack of them and they are vicious. They are all in their 30s and they delight in treating me like garbage. I'm not sure what I did to bother them, but it's been like this since Day 1. I've watched new employees get brought into their circle while I remain on the outside. Recently, my team went out for a group lunch and they were all talking about going out for dinner the next night – and I was the only one at the table not included. Oh, and one of them is my boss. If you're part of this group, you get an office birthday party. If you aren't, you're ignored. I've tried talking to a higher-up, but he's in another province and isn't interested. What should I do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Life is like high school with money.” You heard that one?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You would think people would outgrow the urge to clique up, but apparently not. There are probably “mean girls” in old folks homes too. (“Oooh, there goes Miss Gross Veins in her fancy new wheelchair. I see you didn't finish your vanilla mush this morning. What's the matter, drop your straw down your front and couldn't fish it out of your cantilevered bosoms?”)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I feel your pain, sister. The few times I toiled in an office, I always felt like an outsider. The worst is that you never know what goofy thing it could be that you're being judged/excluded for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once, when I was working in a television newsroom, a friend of mine from the outside world joined the staff. After he had embedded himself in the cliques, I asked him: “Why am I treated like such a pariah?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's your attitude,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What attitude? I work harder than anyone else and I'm totally grateful for the job. Why do you think people think I have an attitude?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Well, it could have something to do with the vintage clothes you wear all the time.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was an eye-opener. I looked around and realized there was an unwritten dress code in the newsroom – black jeans, nice sweater (usually green), sneakers (or horrible, “I've got other things on my mind” Wallabee-type shoes). I was flouting this unwritten convention. Hence: “attitude.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So that's one way you can go: If there's anyone in the office you trust, take him/her aside and ask why everyone else gives you the cold shoulder. If the person can manage to be honest with you, the answer might be painful, but also illuminating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From there, as I see it, you have three options: conform, ignore or get another job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, ask yourself: “How badly do I want to be part of this ‘in' group, and why?” Is it that old Groucho Marx thing: “I would never want to be a part of any club that would have someone like me for a member”? (I'm paraphrasing here). The converse being, of course: “I want to be part of any club that refuses someone like me membership.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could that be it? If so, re-examine your desire to join this clique. Recall that in Mean Girls, Cady joins “the Plastics” only to find out that being popular isn't all it was cut out to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I hate to use a cornball, middlebrow movie (even one written by Tina Fey) as a guideline for behaviour, but maybe that's the ticket for you. Just decide you don't need them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is also possible that you're simply in the wrong job. (Me, I started wearing jeans and green sweaters in the newsroom, but it didn't really help: I found more kindred spirits when I left and joined a book-chat show.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But quitting is an extreme measure, and a step best taken only after careful consideration, and definitely not for the sole reason that these office harpies are treating you like crap. Why let them win?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, I say: Be patient. Keep your head down and chin up (metaphorically). Recall that a) cliques have a way of turning on themselves after a while; b) the mean girls may start to notice your good qualities after a while; c) if you don't seem all too interested in becoming part of their precious little in-group, the Groucho Marx effect may begin to work its magic on them, and they may come with their hats in their hand to you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A little attitude goes a long way. Maybe a more apposite aphorism for you in this circumstance is: “Any club that doesn't want someone like me as a member can bite me.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He almost got away with it. For more than a year, Mayor Rob Ford has been pushing his simplistic vision for transit expansion, hoping to prevail through sheer bluster and force of will.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He ignored the host of transit experts who called his vision nonsense. He refused to take his plans to city council, bypassing the city's supreme democratic body. He spurned the TTC manager and TTC chair who dared to question him. But on Wednesday, council struck back, handing the mayor his worst defeat and rubbishing his transit blueprint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City hall veterans are struggling to remember a time when a mayor of Toronto suffered such a humiliating and public setback. Mel Lastman eventually lost a bid to ship Toronto garbage to the Adams Mine. David Miller failed in his first try at passing the land transfer tax. But this – this was on a whole other scale of magnitude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than $8-billion in funding was at stake. The shape of Toronto transit for decades to come was on the line. It is one of the biggest files on any mayor's desk, and Mr. Ford is no longer in control of it. He called the council vote “technically speaking … irrelevant,” a breath-taking statement for a mayor to make after a full day of sincere and passionate debate on an issue about which everyone cares. But it is his own leadership, not city council's legitimacy, that is now in doubt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transit City, the light-rail network that Mr. Ford declared dead, is suddenly alive and breathing again, having emerged like Lazarus from its underground tomb. Karen Stintz, the estimable TTC chair whom Mr. Ford was foolish enough to underestimate, is the hero of the hour, talked about as a contender for mayor in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is hard to imagine a more galling outcome for Mr. Ford, who has said over and over that “people want subways” and that he would never stand for more “streetcars” (his sneering shorthand for light-rail) on city roads. It undermines one of his central campaign promises: to deliver subways and only subways. It hurts his strategy for re-election, which relies in part on delivering a subway to vote-rich Scarborough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Ms. Stintz took the high road, calling the vote a “common-sense compromise” instead of a defeat for the mayor, the Ford brothers were clearly displeased. A bitter Doug Ford blamed downtown interests, saying they have created a “two-tier city” in which the downtown enjoys subway travel and people are “freezing their backsides off up on Eglinton.” He warned, “This fight is not over. We need to bring it to the streets.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a sign of the Fords' frustration that instead of dominating council, as they did through much of their first year, they are now threatening to go around it. It is pure populism, an appeal to go over the head of city councillors straight to the subway-loving people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the mayor has only himself to blame. He killed Transit City on his very first day in office, upending a plan that was negotiated, approved, funded and under construction. He took it on himself to cook up a new one with the provincial government that would have wasted nearly $2-billion by burying a light-rail line designed for surface travel. He promised to build a vastly expensive Sheppard subway without any real idea of how to pay for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Ms. Stintz tried to throw him a lifeline, suggesting that he could start building his Sheppard subway with money saved by running Eglinton above ground on its wide eastern stretches, the mayor refused to grab it. Now council has adopted a plan that could put surface light-rail not only on Eglinton but on Finch and parts of Sheppard. It's not a bad result for commuters. Conceivably, they could see Sheppard subway extended to Victoria Park. They could get some rapid transit on busy Finch Avenue West. The Eglinton-Scarborough Crosstown line, in a tunnel in the central city and above ground to the east, is still a valuable project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tragedy for Mr. Ford is that he could have grabbed Ms. Stintz's compromise and claimed a win. Now, a new transit plan has been rammed down his throat at an open meeting of city council as the whole city watched. Such is the price of obstinacy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sheldon Souray's <span class="companylink">NHL</span> exile lasted one full, challenging season, in which he played 40 admittedly undistinguished AHL games for the Hershey Bears.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relations were so far gone with his estranged employers, the Edmonton Oilers, that they didn't even want him playing for their own farm team. (Hershey is the Washington Capitals' minor-league affiliate.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It meant, at 34, Souray pretty well knew his five-year, $27-million (U.S.) contract, his injury history and the Oilers' unhappiness meant he would be in the minors for an entire year (2010-11) – doing penance for speaking frankly about his view of the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> organization and where it was heading. Irreconcilable differences is a concept Souray wholly understands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And I would have hated to go out on that note,” he said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So here he is, now 35, and back in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>, two-thirds of the way through the season, playing with a 27-23-2 Dallas Stars team pushing hard for a Western Conference playoff berth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though Souray wasn't around Dallas last year, he knows the stats: The Stars missed the playoffs by one victory, posting 95 points (tied for the highest total in history by a non-playoff team). Souray is a shutdown defenceman nowadays – playing mostly with another former Montreal Canadiens blueliner, Stéphane Robidas – and, according to Stars general manager Joe Nieuwendyk, he still gets a lot of space out there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strapping 6 foot 4, 233 pounds and someone who regularly challenged Zdeno Chara and Shea Weber at the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s all-star skills hardest-shot contest, Souray is known primarily for two qualities: playing a mean, physical style and that heavy shot. (He is tied for the team lead with 130 shots, five of which have found the mark this season.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Souray is an interesting character – chatty, blunt, honest to a fault. He left Montreal after six seasons and joined the Oilers in 2007. He was a (sort-of) hometown hero, from nearby Elk Point, Alta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had one great year in Edmonton, his second (2008-09), which featured 23 goals and 30 assists. But he was hurt most of Years 1 and 3; Year 4 was spent in Hershey and the Oilers ultimately bought out Year 5 of the deal, no one wanting to claim him on re-entry waivers because the cost was too high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Souray is on a more modest ticket this time around (one-year, $1.65-million), but still having fun and still very much the same gregarious guy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I seriously almost don't remember most of [his year in the AHL] because it was such a nightmare. It was an experience. It's the business side of things. I got hurt really early down there, and I never really played that well,” he said. “I was never given much hope from the organization … so that took the wind out of my sails a little bit.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a decade of playing in major Canadian media markets, Dallas, Souray says, is the perfect fit now – and not just because of the warm climate. Souray's off-season home is Malibu, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We went to [Minneapolis] the other day, and that was the first cold-weather place we'd gone to this year where it was actually cold – and we were like a bunch of babies there,” Souray said with a laugh. “It was hilarious. I can see why guys go to Dallas and want to sign down there. It's beautiful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For 10, 11 years, I've been in the media spotlight. Then, you go to Dallas and they're still talking about the [NFL's] Cowboys, so … it's been a welcome change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's worked out well,” Souray said of this latest stop in his hockey life. “It's just a great bunch of guys. It feels like we've been together a lot longer than we have. It was an easy situation to go into. I'm grateful for the opportunity we have.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ninety years ago this week, Vancouver bade farewell to its favourite citizen with a funeral larger than had ever been held in the city. At the age 58, Seraphim Fortes, known to locals as Joe, had died of pneumonia and a stroke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city is commemorating black history month with a series of cultural and historical events in the coming weeks. Of the many who made a contribution to the city's life, none were so loved as Joe Fortes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His name lives on today, gracing a popular oyster house, where one assumes many diners suppose it is named after the restaurant's founder. A branch of the public library also carries his name. It can be found near the English Bay waterfront where he lived, and earned his reputation as a lifeguard and swimming instructor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the day of his funeral, the Holy Rosary men's choir sang hymns in the cathedral. The air was redolent of incense mixed with the sweetness of bouquets and wreaths. A mound of mismatched single flowers had been placed atop the coffin by schoolchildren.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those youngsters who did not attend the service instead had their studies interrupted in the classroom for five minutes, as a moment of silence throughout the city was followed by a lesson from teachers in self-sacrifice and devotion to duty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the gravesite, Rev. William O'Boyle told those gathered, “You do honour not only to Old Joe, who has just gone out with the tide on the great ocean of eternity, but to yourselves, indeed, in gathering to tender solemn homage of respect for the passing of a great soul.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A marker placed in the ground atop the final resting place was a simple stone into which had been carved just three letters – JOE.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Named by his parents for the highest rank of angel, Seraphim Fortes was born to a Barbadian father of African ancestry and a Spanish (or perhaps Portuguese) mother on Feb. 9, 1863, in Port of Spain in the British sugar colony of Trinidad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 17, he left the Caribbean for Liverpool, England, where he won swimming races across the Mersey River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1884, he joined the crew of the windjammer Robert Kerr, embarking from Britain on an ill-fated voyage to the Pacific Coast. Rough seas at Cape Horn and an unhappy crew made for a harrowing sail. Then, the captain died. Even as the barque neared its destination, the battered ship grounded at San Juan Island, needing to be refloated. It was leaking badly when it limped into Burrard Inlet nearly a year to the day after leaving Britain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The damaged boat was sold and the crew paid off. Mr. Fortes wandered into the Granville townsite and found work as a shoeblack. He was soon employed by the Sunnyside Hotel as a porter and roustabout. As the fledgling city burned to the ground in what would be known as the Great Fire, the young man escorted a married woman and her son to safety aboard his old ship, anchored in the harbour. He also salvaged much of the hotel guests' luggage before the building was consumed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those were but his first acts of bravery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the city quickly rebuilt, Mr. Fortes became bartender at the Bodega saloon, 21 Carrall St. He later took up similar duties down the block at the Alhambra Hotel before tiring of the saloon life and establishing himself in a tent on a slight rise of land overlooking English Bay. In time, he built a tidy waterfront cottage at the foot of what would become Bidwell Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A regular bather, Mr. Fortes soon became known for rescuing careless swimmers. In 1898, he rescued J.C. McCook, the newly appointed American consul for the Klondike gold rush town of Dawson City, who suffered an attack in the water while visiting the city. The consul was recorded in newspapers as the fifth person to be rescued by Mr. Fortes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The count was up to 11 in the summer of 1903, by which time Mr. Fortes had been hired by the city as lifeguard, swimming instructor and special constable responsible for the beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1908, the city surprised him with the presentation of a gold medal. “I've always tried to do my best at the bay,” he said, “and I shall try to keep that reputation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he aged, his barrel chest grew ever thicker and he weighed nearly 300 pounds. He claimed to drink a glass of salt water as a tonic for good health each morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He taught generations of children to swim. The newspapers of the day recorded his instruction as holding children afloat by gripping their swimsuits with both hands and ordering them to “Kick yo' feet!” Among his charges were Sylvia Goldstein, the girl for whom the Sylvia Hotel was named, and Pat Slattery, a future sports columnist and politician. Mr. Fortes even appeared on postcards sold to tourists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years after he died, leaving worldly goods estimated at just $228.66, a water fountain designed by the sculptor Charles Marega was erected in Alexandra Park near the beach he patrolled. An adult needs to crouch to take a sip, for it is not designed for grownups. Engraved on the back of the stone is the inscription, “Little children loved him.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people are dreading the end of the season of Downton Abbey on PBS. What will they do without weekly doses of febrile orchestral music swelling over declarations of love in elegant dresses? Publishers have already had the sense to capitalize on Downton fever by putting out companion books – non-fiction guides and memoirs of prewar aristocratic pleasures and the real earls and countesses and maids who inspired the series.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those of us with anglophilic tastes in literature have been reading nearly identical Downton-like books for years and know that the show takes its inspiration from a number of famous British novels about Edwardian or interwar privilege. Even the “upstairs-downstairs” device – the interweaving of servants' and lords' problems in a large house – was a boon to many a novelist long before the 1970s British TV series of the same name. Here are a few: If you crave grand country houses and unchallenged class hierarchy and unrequited love and whispering in the library, read these books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Go-Between, by L.P. Hartley (1953), is the model of the dreamy genre. It begins with one of the most famous opening lines in English literature: “The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there.” In 1900, a small boy goes to stay with a school friend with an upper-class family and is humiliated by his lack of breeding. He gets unwittingly involved in the cross-class affair of the young lady of the house. There is a lot about the friction between manners and passion. It will break your heart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Remains of the Day (1989) by Kazuo Ishiguro is a pitch-perfect narration in the voice of Stevens, a butler preoccupied with dignity and standards – much like Downton Abbey's Mr. Carson. His reminiscences concern the 1930s, when he was the head of the household of a Lord Darlington. In the foreground is the butler's repressed relationship with the equally respectable head housekeeper, Miss Kenton; in the background are the preparations for war and his employer's troubling connections with fascism. There's so much repressed love in this it makes Anna and Mr. Bates seem like sybarites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loving, by Henry Green (1945), is modernist fiction, dazzling and labyrinthine. It's set in an Irish country house during the Second World War – the twist is that the lords and ladies are away, and the servants are at play. The lecherous butler is not nearly as respectable as Carson or Stevens, and all sorts of side-door shenanigans transpire. The war looms invisibly over this one too, and that's a device crucial to Downton and to all the rest of these end-of-an-era romances: There is more tragedy and heroism in a life that's doomed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, many grand-house narratives are comedy; they mine the anachronism of the upper classes for its ridiculousness. A Handful of Dust (1934) is arguably Evelyn Waugh's best novel (certainly better than the religio-sentimental Brideshead Revisited, which is much more famous because it was also a lush British TV series). Its country house, Hetton Abbey, is famously ugly, a Victorian neo-Gothic pile, and the house's owner, Tony Last (he's one of the last, see, of these kinds of people) is embarrassingly in love with a way of life that is clearly no longer valued by anyone else. An interesting parallel is that Hetton could be, like Downton, taken over by an obscure relative. (Also interesting: The plot of Downton creator Julian Fellowes's novel Snobs very closely follows that of A Handful of Dust. It's a kind of a cover version, to put it diplomatically.) If you like that, you will also laugh at Nancy Mitford's Love in a Cold Climate (1949), part of a trilogy about isolated aristocratic eccentricity. And if you want sheer comic joy in a grand house, without any war or shadows of any kind, read every single story by P.G. Wodehouse set in Blandings Castle – a paradisiacal place where the absent-minded Lord Emsworth's passion is his prize pig and his most frightening nemesis his dour Scottish gardener, McAllister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similarly enchanted universe exists in the short stories of the real Edwardian gentleman Saki – notably in his most famous, Tobermory, a tale about a talking cat that knows too much about the goings on in his mansion. Absurd plot points such as these should not shock followers of the Downton soap opera, a drama that could be seen entirely as comedy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Weir will return to the PGA Tour Thursday at the <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span> Pebble Beach National Pro-Am after a seven-month absence. But the 2003 Masters champion who underwent elbow surgery last August won't play next week in the Northern Trust Open, which he won in 2003 and 2004, because he wasn't given one of eight exemptions that the tournament sponsor can use.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weir, who will turn 42 in May, was both surprised and disappointed when he learned the bad news. He is not only a fairly recent two-time winner, but he's a student of, and loves, the classic Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles. He has said so publicly. Weir appreciates it so much that Ian Andrew, his golf course design partner, made a special trip there to study it with Weir.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's hard to believe that a two-time champion, and within the last nine years, would not be given an exemption,” Bill Paul, the RBC Canadian Open's tournament director, said Wednesday. “I am not saying that as a Canadian. I know there are tough choices, but he is a former champion. I don't know of too many tournaments that would reject a former champ. Oh well, maybe they have other reasons.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weir did not want to comment on his not receiving an exemption, probably because he doesn't want to jeopardize his chance of getting sponsors' invitations into other tournaments if he needs them. Mike Bone, the Northern Trust Open's general manager, responded to an inquiry from The Globe and Mail about why Weir wasn't issued an exemption. He chose to provide a statement through the PGA Tour rather than agree to a request for an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Mike Weir is a tremendous competitor, and, as you point out, he has a great record at the Northern Trust Open, with back-to-back wins in 2003 and 2004,” Bone said. “We have nothing but respect for him as a player and a person and are so happy to see that he's making a return to the PGA Tour after struggling with an elbow injury in 2011.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“However, choosing the recipients of our sponsor exemptions is very difficult,” Bone said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bone said that the Northern Trust receives “dozens and dozens of requests every year from many qualified candidates from the amateur and professional ranks, yet we have only eight exemptions to offer. We have to consider several variables when making the final decision, and while Mike was not offered an exemption this year, we wish him the best throughout the 2012 season.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's all boilerplate stuff, and doesn't say much about what went into denying Weir an exemption. In fact, the tournament offered 10 exemptions, of which the sponsor granted its usual allotment of eight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sponsor's exemptions include, among others: Fred Couples, the 1990 and 1992 champion, and one of the game's most popular players; Patrick Cantlay, a junior at UCLA and the top-ranked amateur in the world who played some great golf on the PGA Tour last year; South Korean K.T. Kim; PGA Tour rookies Billy Hurley III and Erik Compton, a first-rate player who has had two heart transplants; and Californian Jason Gore, who got in after he initiated a furious Twitter campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the PGA Tour, which has two commissioner's foreign exemptions at its disposal, gave them to Japanese players Ryo Ishikawa and Yuta Ikeda. Given that Weir is Canadian, he falls into the category of player eligible for a foreign exemption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A source close to the events that transpired around Weir but who did not want to be identified speculated that Asian television could be a priority with Northern Trust, a Chicago-based financial services company that has Asia-Pacific operations.. Riviera is owned by Japanese interests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weir can still play his way into the Northern Trust, by finishing in the top 10 this week at Pebble Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm ready to play,” Weir said in an e-mail the other day. It'll be his first tournament action since he withdrew from the Canadian Open last July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Northern Trust Open wasn't ready to grant a battling two-time former champion an exemption. It's a stunning insult to Weir. The decision is an error of omission. It's also an error of commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Caterpillar closed a plant in Southern Ontario last week and threw 450 people out of work, some commentators treated it like a national catastrophe. Caterpillar, which is notorious for its hardball labour tactics, plans to relocate the jobs in Indiana, where people are willing to work for half of what the unionized workers in Ontario got.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I felt awful for the workers. Who wouldn't? But Ontario has to compete with the entire world. And even if those jobs don't move away, many are being swept away by new technology. The mighty engine of Confederation has turned into its rust belt. But nobody in the rest of Canada is feeling particularly sorry for us. We squandered the fat years on a vast expansion of our government and threw away our money on foolish green energy schemes. Now we face a gloomy decade of tax increases, deteriorating health care and deep cuts to everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Did I mention that the average detached house in Toronto costs $606,000?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No wonder Ontarians are so depressed. No wonder so many of my friends' kids are moving away to Edmonton, Calgary and Vancouver. These are the same places their parents were eager to escape 30 or 40 years ago. Back then, Toronto was the place to be if you wanted to make something of yourself. Today, it's the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country's economic, demographic and political power are all shifting. Western power has already begun to change our national values. Stephen Harper's majority was no fluke. He was elected by a new coalition of westerners and voters in the suburbs of Toronto. These people prefer CTV to the CBC. They think Ottawa and government should matter less, and they seldom think about Quebec at all. This is an epochal shift. Quebec's threats and aspirations dominated (and paralyzed) national affairs for the better part of a generation. Today, people no longer ask what it will take to keep Quebec happy. Instead, they ask why Quebec is getting billions in equalization payments so it can subsidize $7-a-day daycare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec is hurtling toward the bottom of the country in income and standard of living. Alberta and Saskatchewan are at the other end. Natural resources play a part in that, but so do values. Quebeckers work fewer hours and make less money than other Canadians, but pay far higher taxes. The oil sands are extremely unpopular in Quebec. And even though Quebec has bountiful resources of its own, Quebeckers don't want to develop them. They'd rather impose carbon taxes and oppose pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like it or not, Canada's stupendous natural resources are our future. They are the envy of the world, and will ensure our prosperity for many years to come. Most Canadians already get this, and the western shift means their voices will become increasingly important. The question is not whether we should develop these resources, but how wisely and how well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environmental romantics who think resource extraction is inherently immoral might want to take a look at Newfoundland. A few years ago, it was dying. It had the lowest education levels and incomes in the country, and young people were leaving by the thousands. Oil has transformed Newfoundland into a modern, vibrant economy where people's kids have a future. The same thing happened in Saskatchewan. Oil has turned Norway into the most prosperous and socially equal country on the planet. Its environment is remarkably unspoiled. And its oil industry has created high-skilled, high-tech jobs and cutting-edge technologies that are in demand around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the Newfoundlanders who used to fish for cod, the people who used to make $32 an hour at Caterpillar are out of luck. But their kids have better prospects. Unlike manufacturing jobs, natural resources can't be relocated to Indiana or China. Some of the kids from Canada's rust belt will get degrees in metallurgy or engineering and move to Edmonton or Saskatoon (or St. John's). They will discover that people in those places are a lot more optimistic than people around here. If I were a few years younger, I might move there myself.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The selection criteria should give greater weight to the ability to speak French or English, the report says, and focus on Canada's long-term labour market needs, instead of on a narrow list of 29 occupations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is an excellent suggestion. It is simply impossible for Ottawa to select workers for short-term needs because of a lack of real-time data about the labour market. Instead, the federal government should use empirical modelling and consultations with the private sector to recruit for emerging high-demand areas. It should also</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">improve its patchwork of settlement services, streamline the recognition of foreign credentials and standardize language training.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The provinces, through the nominee program, and businesses, through the temporary workers' stream, are in a much better position to select workers for immediate openings. The ranks of temporary workers have grown exponentially in the last decade to 250,000 from 100,000. This week's tragic car accident in southwestern Ontario, which killed 10 migrant workers, exposed the significance of this sector. The report notes this program could be improved by ensuring these workers are protected from abuse, and have a path to permanent residency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the retirement of the baby boomers, the role of immigrants, both temporary and permanent, in the economy will only grow. Canada should fine-tune its selection model, and ensure the country's reputation isn't sullied by newcomers' complaints of chronic underemployment. By raising the unemployment rate of immigrants to the level of non-immigrants, an additional 370,000 people would join the work force. This shows that any investment by the government in job strategies would more than pay off.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Californians voted in 2008 to spend billions to grease the wheels of a high-speed train service running down the spine of the state, there was great cheering among advocates for the same type of system in Canada.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon after the California vote, campaigns to build much-studied bullet train proposals in Alberta and another between Ontario and Quebec cranked up anew. With the U.S. seemingly at the threshold of pushing ahead on the high-speed front, the question was asked: Did Canada want to be left behind at the station?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe was already years ahead of North America when it came to trains that rocketed along at speeds of up to 300 kilometres an hour. Meantime, Japan, China and Korea were building train systems right out of the futuristic utopia portended in The Jetsons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, if high-speed believers here were hoping that California would serve as a catalyst for a turbo-charged rail service or two of our own, we bear bad news. It looks like the California initiative is deader than Ron Paul's presidential hopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the state's voters authorized $9-billion (U.S.) in state bonds three years ago to get things going on the proposed 836-kilometre San Diego-San Francisco track, it was based on an overall estimated cost of $33-billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Since then,” writes Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez, “the high-speed dream has become a slow-motion nightmare and we might be better off running a zip line from Mt. Shasta to Mt. Baldy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some of the updated facts: The projected completion date has been pushed back to 2033, from 2020. More jarring, the estimated cost has grown to $117-billion, with no assurances that it won't be much higher. The California High Speed Rail Authority, established in the mid-1990s with the specific intent of getting a bullet line built, is now saying that the project represents an “immense financial risk” to the state. A state, it needs no reminding, that was at risk of declaring bankruptcy not that long ago and remains in desperate financial straits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Needless to say, the public's mood has turned against the high-speed rail scheme in a big way. Its concerns are wide-ranging and include worries that the technology proposed for the California line is already out of date. Japan, South Korea and China have built mass transportation systems using new-age magnetic levitation trains that glide above guideways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A poll last fall showed that two-thirds of Californians are now firmly against the project. One resident that Mr. Lopez interviewed spoke for many who are now deeply skeptical about the viability of the plan: “If they're saying $100-billion, that means it'll be $200-billion.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may be years now, if ever, before the state is in a position to undertake such an expensive endeavour. And even if the project is eventually green-lighted, it would take 20 years to build. What this means for U.S. President Barack Obama's grand vision of a network of high-speed trains jetting people about the country is unclear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, the President dangled $13-billion in stimulus spending to promote investment in high-speed rail. California represented the best immediate hope of getting anything going. Florida was the next best hope and it said no to high-speed a year ago over cost concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most developed proposals in Canada are for a line that goes from Quebec City to Windsor, Ont., and another that stretches from Calgary to Edmonton. Well, we know what kind of fiscal shape the provincial governments of Ontario and Quebec are in so there's zero chance they'll be providing any dollars in the near future to pursue any high-speed rail proposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta would be the one province that might have the financial wherewithal to mount a serious effort. But despite its oil wealth, it has its own financial concerns and it's likely that the goings-on in California will kill any appetite there might have been for the idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So for the foreseeable future, North Americans looking for high-speed rail thrills will have to go to Europe or Asia. We'll be staying in our cars and complaining about the commute.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Harper is in a delicate situation. Let's give him a hand.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harper's hosts this week is a rising economic superpower that he's already annoyed in the past with pointed talk of human rights and Tibet. He can't ignore the imperative of trade with China. But he's under pressure at home to raise issues like human rights, imprisoned Uighur Husseyin Celil, and China's veto of a UN resolution on Syria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How does a prime minister raise topics that offend his hosts when doing more business with them is crucial to Canada's economy? There's no Miss Manners guidebook to threading that needle. So as a public service, and with the help of some Canadian experts on China, here's a handy etiquette guide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, remember the point. You want to sell stuff, sure, but when it comes to human rights and issues like Syria, the goal isn't just to say you've raised it, but to influence China. It is, as one expert said, about the faith, not the catechism. No, the Communist Party of China isn't going to suddenly buckle under and decide you're right, but it's a complex country with evolving public opinion and international links.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, tone matters. When expressing universal values, it's best not to sound like you're going into someone's house and telling them how to raise their children. Canadians don't always raise the same issues in say, Saudi Arabia. Beijing is sensitive to signs of respect. Brock University professor Charles Burton says that's partly because they don't want foreign leaders making Chinese people feel their country is losing face – which is why public statements matter. But respect and face are culturally important – so tone does, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It won't please everyone. But if Mr. Harper is to stress gains with Beijing without ignoring rights, there are dos and don'ts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do: Link Chinese and Canadian cases. China pressed for last year's extradition of smuggler Lai Changxing, and there will be other such cases. Ottawa is concerned for Canadians like Uighur-Canadian Mr. Celil, convicted of terrorism in a closed trial. Beijing hasn't accepted that Canadian courts are outside political control, Mr. Burton said. So when they raise the next Mr. Lai, Ottawa should raise Mr. Celil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't: Make the linkage a promise of legal decisions Canada can't deliver, but rather process and access, like a consular visit to Mr. Celil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do: Raise rights in public. The Chinese leadership doesn't love it, but that's the point. Without it, Mr. Burton said, Beijing and the Chinese public will assume acceptance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't: Make Beijing feel compelled to retaliate. That means a respectful tone; concern not accusation. Leave names of Chinese dissidents to private talks, where Mr. Harper can give a list to President Hu Jintao, express concerns and ask for info.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do: Use public opinion. Mr. Harper can point out it is Canadians who have concerns about rights in China. Beijing does care about image. It affects China's soft power, and can raise political obstacles to initiatives abroad. In private, Mr. Harper could say, “It would be much easier for Canada to deal politically with China if China enjoyed a higher reputation among Canadians.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't: Raise rights without establishing it's your business. Referring to things like the UN covenant on rights, which China signed, highlights shared obligations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do: Stress the rule of law. Canada has an interest in a more transparent Chinese legal system for business, and Mr. Harper can link it to legal rights for individuals, noting a less arbitrary process reduces public resentment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't: Insult China's courts more vigorously than seeking improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do: Publicly say you raised Canada's view on Syria with Chinese leaders, as Mr. Harper did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't: Expect China to accept a (second) UN resolution condemning a regime for crackdowns on protesters. But note it is shaping Western public opinion of China.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A stranger to the game would never pick him out as the head coach.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While others in tracksuits race about the practice with their whistles and drills, Ken Hitchcock sits, huddled, at the far end of the players bench in the hours before his St. Louis Blues effortlessly dispatched the spiralling Ottawa Senators 3-1 last Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">White-haired, and today a shadow of his former rotund self, he has been handed a fourth chance, at 60, and is more than making the most of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But right now he is talking about the latest troubles in NHL hockey: coach injuries. Tom Renney of the Oilers cut badly by a puck in Edmonton, Lindy Ruff with three broken ribs when run over by one of his own Buffalo Sabres players.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a dangerous sport,” Hitchcock says with a laugh. “That's why I think we should get hazard pay.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only the day before, one of Hitchcock's players tipped a puck that very nearly caught the head coach in the head. The coach ordered him to do push-ups to atone. The old Ken Hitchcock would have boiled him alive in the hot tub before nailing him to the far end of the bench.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The true “hazard” of coaching in the NHL is the pink slip. You can win a Stanley Cup, as Hitchcock did with the Dallas Stars, and be fired the moment the wave you have been riding hits the first rock. Two years ago this month, Hitchcock was fired by the Columbus Blue Jackets. It hurt more than when Dallas canned him, more than when he was let go by the Philadelphia Flyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He thought he was through only to be surprised by a call from an old friend from his Dallas days, Doug Armstrong, now general manager of the Blues. Armstrong was firing coach Davis Payne and wanted Hitchcock to take over – an astonishingly successful move that has resulted in a 25-7-7 run for the Blues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They say Hitchcock has changed. The Edmonton native who came up through minor hockey and the minor leagues had no playing credentials to speak of and exerted his control through strict discipline. (It's no surprise that he studies the strategies and style of U.S. Civil War generals.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His NHL reputation was of a short shelf life: come in hard, bring discipline, get immediate results, but eventually wear on the players. His success in international competition, interestingly, is renowned where everything is, by necessity, short-term and immediate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They say he has become a kinder, gentler coach, but if he has changed then so, too, has the game. The change, he says, goes far beyond the early differences noted after the 2004-05 lockout and the bringing in of new rules to restrict obstruction and reward skill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's really different now,” he says. “The last two years it's changed even more. We tried to still play possession hockey after the lockout, and now it's race-a-rrific hockey. Bang it up the ice, chip it in, fore-check like hell, bang it down the ice.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another change, he says, is the relative youth and inexperience of today's players. This shift is most profound on defence, he says, with freewheeling youngsters far more inclined to join the rush.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You used to circle one defenceman, maybe two, to join the play,” he says. “So you would pay attention to two defencemen on every team. Now, you've got one on every pair that joins the play, so you're always defending four on the rush.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You're trying to get 22- and 23-year-olds playing like 27-year-olds, so you're trying to get some sort of order in your game but you're doing it with much younger players, and I think that's why, for me, the biggest change I've had to adjust to is the next day. Not the game day, the next day.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is talking about teaching, the true art of coaching young players. Coaches who fail to adjust, he says, are in danger of forcing their players on “information overload” and freezing them to a point where they are spending so much time trying to figure out what they are supposed to be doing that the play will be long since past them.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RRSPs or TFSAs for your retirement savings? Let the debate over the future of Old Age Security be your guide to the right choice.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's talk that Ottawa will, over time, raise the age at which people can claim OAS to 67 from 65. With seniors expected to account for one-quarter of the population within 20 years, the government is looking for ways to contain spending growth in programs such as health care and OAS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now let's jump ahead a decade or so and imagine that efforts to keep spending in hand have not worked out. Hungry for revenue, the government looks for ways to cut spending and raise taxes. As part of an effort to ensure all segments of the population share the pain, registered retirement savings plans and tax-free savings accounts come under review.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The usual point of comparison between TFSAs and RRSPs is the amount of tax you pay on the money you contribute today, and on the money you'll withdraw in the future. Now, there's something else to think about. Which savings vehicle is easier for the government to raid for extra revenue?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RRSPs get the nod here for sure, but TFSAs could get whacked, too, if the government needed every possible cent of tax revenue. That's why today's smart savers will hedge their retirement savings by using both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time of perpetual angst about inadequate retirement savings, it may seem far-fetched to talk about the government changing RRSPs and TFSAs for the worse. In fact, the government is trying to strengthen the retirement savings system right now by introducing the pooled registered pension plan, or PRPP, which is a mechanism for helping small employers provide a pension-like savings plan for workers. It's supposed to help the many workers who aren't now covered by an employer pension plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The possibility that the OAS will pay out less is another reason to expect the government to leave RRSP and TFSAs alone, and even maybe enhance them. If the government delays your OAS by two years, it's up to you to save more to cover that period. The government can't very well take away with both hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet, one of the biggest financial lessons of the past several years is that preparing for the worst is not a wasted effort. Canada's economy is in good shape on a comparative basis globally, but a long period of weak growth coupled with the demands of an aging population could put major stress on federal government finances. In turn, the government could adopt a variety of measures that affect all parts of the population, including retirees and people saving for retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What might the government do? Jamie Golombek, managing director of tax and estate planning at CIBC Private Wealth Management, speculated that the maximum annual contribution to an RRSP could be rolled back. For the 2012 tax year, the contribution ceiling is $22,970.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RRSPs must be converted to registered retirement income funds by the end of the year in which you turn 71. RRIF rules as they are now bug a lot of seniors, but Mr. Golombek said they could certainly be stiffened by a government looking to boost tax revenue. For example, mandatory annual withdrawal amounts could be increased, thereby prying more taxable income out of registered plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measures like these wouldn't solve a cash-hungry government's problems, which is why the risk of an income tax increase at some future point can't be dismissed. Users of RRSPs and RRIFs would be prime victims of a higher tax rates, while TFSA holders would be immune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RRSPs are all about tax deferral. Make a contribution and you get the tax back on that amount. Then, when you withdraw money from a RRIF to live on in retirement, you pay tax on that. Contributions to TFSAs are made with money on which you're already paid your taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“With TFSAs, you've paid your tax up front, and you'll never pay tax again,” Mr. Golombek said. “What's done is done.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TFSAs look to be safer from government tampering than RRSPs and RRIFs, but they're not invulnerable. Mr. Golombek said a desperate government could curtail the tax-free status of TFSAs and start applying income tax on investment gains in these accounts as of a certain date. “That's if they wanted to eliminate the TFSA, which seems ridiculous given all the effort that's gone into it and how Canadians have adopted it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the government makes changes to the OAS now, what's to say it won't raise taxes or make other changes if conditions worsen in the years ahead? Insure your retirement savings by using TFSAs as well as RRSPs.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I was growing up over there in the land of poetry, pints of plain porter and incurable scheming, people swore all the effin' time. Swearing was punctuation in a sentence or a story. You added some effin' to lend rhythm to what you were saying, so it didn't sound boring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone who has seen the plays or movies of Martin McDonagh or the early work of Roddy Doyle knows the terrain – the spectacular vernacular of mockery, self-deprecation and general dystopia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the bourgeoisie the practice of being foul-mouthed was frowned upon. Unless horse racing or rugby was involved. Still, it was obvious that swearing and listening to colourful language was a thrill to the mucky-mucks, a release from the social pressure to conform and, well, a tonic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This brings me to Louie (FX Canada, 10 p.m.). Watch this show. The stand-up comic known as Louis C. K. plays a divorced stand-up comedian with two young daughters and the show is an extraordinary blend of warmth, wryness and full-out toxic, X-rated humour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show has had a low profile in Canada while it has become acclaimed and adored in the United States. Tonight's episode airing here is the first of the show's second season. It brought the star two Emmy nominations last year, a major shift from his first foray into TV comedy, a disaster done for HBO a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A good deal of comedy on TV is formulaic, some of it done with panache and skill. But Louie is nothing like anything else on TV right now. Louie C.K. has something of a reputation for being strange. Last year, while on a radio show with Donald Rumsfeld, who was promoting a book, he repeatedly asked the former U.S. secretary of defence if he was “a lizard person” who ate babies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the show he's both a working comic and an eternally perplexed but smitten dad. The encounters with his daughters are simultaneously priceless and sweet. The encounters with others, including his sister, are sometimes filled with doleful humour about his ex-wife. The scenes from his stand-up act can be either melancholic humour about having kids or scathing, swear-filled diatribes about the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the core of the character Louie C.K. has fashioned for himself is a Charlie Chaplin-like, lovable blunderer. One feels for him. And then the shockingly raw language of his comedy kicks in, and you feel the visceral punch of his angry befuddlement at the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Louie is not a TV sitcom about a single dad and his wisecracking little daughters. It's a far more substantial creation – a meditation on despondency, family and being alone. In a way, it captures a universal attitude – take comfort in your family because the world outside is going to drive you to despair. And despairingly, laughter is your best bet for surviving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the mucky-mucks who looked down their noses at swearing but were thrilled by it, anyone coming to Louie with an uptight attitude will find release in its coarsely comic laugh at the world. It is a unique creation, one with clarity and power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also airing tonight</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS Wars: Hope, Science and the Internet (CBC, 8 p.m. on The Nature of Things) looks at “the science, controversy and human drama” around what is called liberation therapy, the controversial treatment for multiple sclerosis pioneered in Italy by Dr. Paolo Zamboni. As we know from news reports, his radical approach met with deep skepticism from the medical establishment, but pressure was put on governments to allow trial procedures using his methods. The program looks at how social media played a role in furthering coverage of Zamboni's treatment. As the program says, the traditional medical protocols “were challenged by two factors: hope and the Internet.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The poor little rich boy of Republican politics gets no love.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, Mitt Romney racks up victories when he needs them. And his embarrassing losses in Tuesday's GOP caucuses in Minnesota and Colorado will not matter much in a nomination contest that will likely be decided by staying power, not short-lived surges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, Tuesday's overwhelming rejection of Mr. Romney by social conservatives in the party does make one wonder whether he could ever woo enough of the Republican base to give President Barack Obama a run for his money in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum steamrolled to victory on Tuesday because he is a candidate tailor-made for the hard-core anti-abortion activists and evangelicals who braved the cold winter night in Minnesota and Colorado. They typically have a disproportionate voice in caucuses, where turnout is low and passion trumps all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, Mr. Romney benefited from rampant anybody-but-John McCain sentiment in Minnesota and Colorado. Compared to the Arizona senator, who once pushed citizenship for illegal immigrants and voted against George W. Bush's sweeping tax cuts, Mr. Romney was considered the conservative alternative to Mr. McCain back then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he swept the Republican races in Colorado and Minnesota, beating Mr. McCain by 42 percentage points in one state and by 19 in the other. But those states typically count for little in Republican nomination politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, two days later, the former Massachusetts governor quit the race, after losing to Mr. McCain in most of the critical Super Tuesday primary states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The danger for Mr. Romney is that Mr. Santorum's victories in Colorado and Minnesota, as well as his 30-percentage point win in the delegate-less Missouri primary, prompt Republicans in other states to take another look at him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the former senator's appeal is highest among social conservatives, who propelled him to a photo-finish win in the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Santorum is also making a pitch for the votes of working-class Republicans turned off by Mr. Romney's patrician image.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the grandson of an immigrant coal miner from heavily unionized western Pennsylvania, who voted against federal right-to-work legislation, he might pull it off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, Super Tuesday falls on March 6, when 10 states will hold primaries and award 437 delegates, or almost 40 per cent of the 1,144 delegates needed to win the nomination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike in 2008, when Mr. McCain locked up the race with Super Tuesday victories in six winner-take-all states, Super Tuesday delegates this year will be awarded on a proportional basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That promises a much longer contest than four years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time Super Tuesday rolls around, however, Newt Gingrich could be once again back from the dead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The former House of Representatives speaker, who has defied reports of his demise twice before, has his sights on winning Southern states such as Georgia and Tennessee to help him drag out the nomination race all the way to the August GOP convention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the very characteristics that make Mr. Santorum and Mr. Gingrich appealing to the Republican base make them unelectable in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a rule, no candidate who scares the average independent voter in Akron can win a general election. Mr. Santorum and Mr. Gingrich fail that test.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Romney may not excite voters, but at least he does not scare them. Most Republicans, above all those most concerned with winning in November, know this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By picking Mr. Santorum, Republicans in Colorado and Minnesota showed they would rather make a statement than win.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minnesota is reliably Democratic in presidential elections, while a growing Hispanic population in Colorado favours Democrats there, too. To win in either state, Republicans need to choose a candidate who appeals to the middle. They keep doing the opposite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, the GOP grassroots in Colorado blew a chance to unseat an unpopular Democratic senator by nominating the most radical Tea Party candidate they could find to run in the general election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shellacking Mr. Romney took on Tuesday in Minnesota and Colorado is humiliating enough for a front-runner with more money and machine than all of his rivals combined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than being a kiss of death, however, it might be seen as a sign of his electability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is also a reminder that Mr. Romney, for all his apparent success with Tea Party voters in New Hampshire and Florida, has not won the affection of his party's base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Money, after all, cannot buy love.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1953, novelist Thomas Mann appealed to an audience of students in Hamburg to strive for “not a German Europe but a European Germany.” This stirring pledge was endlessly repeated at the time of German unification.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, we have a variation that few foresaw: a European Germany in a German Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chancellor Angela Merkel's Berlin republic is a European Germany, in the rich, positive sense in which the great novelist had come to use the term. It is free, civilized, democratic, law-bound, socially and environmentally conscious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's far from perfect, obviously, but as good as any other big country in Europe – and the best Germany we've ever had.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet because of the crisis of the euro zone this European Germany finds itself, unwillingly, at the centre of a German Europe. No one can seriously doubt that Germany is calling the shots in the euro zone. The reason there is a fiscal compact treaty agreed by 25 European Union member states is that Berlin wanted it. Desperate, impoverished Greeks are being told “do their homework” by Germans. More extraordinary still, the German Chancellor is now telling French voters who to vote for in their own presidential election, through a series of campaign appearances with President Nicolas Sarkozy. Everyone says Europe is being led by “Merkozy” but the reality is more like “Merkelzy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany did not seek this leadership position. Rather, this is a perfect illustration of the law of unintended consequences. German leaders, from Helmut Schmidt to Helmut Kohl, had envisaged advancing the European project through a European monetary union, but it was François Mitterrand's France that insisted on pinning Germany down to it. Historians can argue about how far the commitment in the Maastricht Treaty was a direct quid pro quo for French support for German unification, but two things are clear. Both sides of the Rhine agreed that this was an important part of binding a newly united Germany into a more united Europe, in which France would continue to play a – if not the – leading role. And many Germans saw giving up their deutschmark as paying an economic price for a larger political good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty years on from Maastricht, we see that the precise opposite has happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economically, the euro turned out to be very good for Germany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Politically, it is precisely the monetary union that has put Germany in the driver's seat and relegated France to the front passenger seat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, Germany is proving a reluctant, nervous and not very skillful driver. There are many reasons for this. One of these is not wanting to be driving in the first place. Another is suspecting that everyone else in the car wants you to pay for the gas, the meal and probably the hotel too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the unhappy sense that they are damned if they do lead and damned if they don't. The terrible history that prompted Mann's postwar appeal plays a role here. If Germany suggests a commissar to oversee Greek budget cuts, he inevitably gets called a gauleiter. Then there is the fact that the German elite simply is not used to playing such a leadership role in Europe, unlike the French elite, who like nothing better. The French want to, but can't; the Germans can, but don't want to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Above all, there is the perennial dilemma of Germany's awkward, in-between size: “too big for Europe, too small for the world” said Henry Kissinger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the most self-confident, adroit elite, and even without the memories of 1914-1945, leadership from that in-between position would be difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two things are therefore needed. First, all Germans should go back and read Mann's short talk, both to understand the historical dimension of today's challenge and to recall the intellectual and moral grandeur that was once theirs. For Mann's beautifully crafted, profoundly moving message to those young Germans in 1953 can also be summarized in three short American words: “Yes we can.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, they need a lot of help from their friends. They won't manage it on their own. We may laugh at Sarko's antics in the front passenger seat (“Non, non, ma chérie! Tout droit, tout droit!”), but he's got the right idea. For Prime Minister David Cameron to consign Britain to the back seat of the European car at this critical moment is folly beyond words. Earlier this week, Ms. Merkel again stressed how much Germany wants to see this fellow northern European, free-market liberal country return to the heart of European affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in Hamburg in 1953, the British were doing everything they could, in a far from ignoble way, to help ruined Germany back on its feet. It would be so shortsighted, so plain dumb, for Britain to abandon Germany to its own devices just when it finds itself playing such a decisive role in Europe – a role that it did not seek, for which it is ill-prepared and in which it needs all the help it can get.</p>

As for the species of treaty to which Canada and China have now agreed – known in Ottawa dialect by the acronym FIPAs, but elsewhere as BITs (bilateral investment treaties), Beijing has one of these with ASEAN, a group of 10 Southeast Asian countries, but not with the U.S. or the European Union, in spite of China's huge amount of trade with both.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese “are pragmatic and skeptical of international entanglements,” says Lawrence Herman, a trade lawyer at Cassels Brock LLP. “So this is a good, indeed very good, first step for Canada.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two essential ingredients in a FIPA are that each country “shall accord to investors of the other [country] treatment no less favourable than that it accords … to its own investors” and that there will be a dispute settlement mechanism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What has actually happened so far between China and Canada is that negotiations have been concluded. It's the lawyers' turn now: to review the draft text.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undoubtedly, there are exclusions, stipulated by both sides. Canada is not about to open up banks and broadcasting to Chinese investors, or to exempt China from the “net benefit” test of the Investment Canada Act; for that matter, FIPAs are apt to do more for established investors than new ones, as Robert Wolfe of Queen's University observes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 1989, Canada has been trying to obtain as many FIPAs as possible, and now has two dozen, with 10 more being actively negotiated. Such an agreement with China has been sought for 18 years. This is not the work of the present government alone, but Mr. Harper and his colleagues have achieved this favourable outcome; their rocky start with China seems to be a thing of the past.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday is Valentine's Day, but there's more than love in the air in Quebec. It will also be opening day at the National Assembly and, although Jean Charest's government has more than a year left, everyone seems to be gearing up for an early election.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Premier's critics say he has no choice, since things are unlikely to improve, although Mr. Charest ruled out a spring vote on Thursday. His Liberals have spent 18 months in limbo, amid corruption allegations and low public confidence in the Premier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After months of infighting that relegated the sovereignty issue to the back burner (if not the freezer), the Parti Québécois isn't in much better shape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now there's the Coalition Avenir Québec – a political medley of old and new faces drawn from right and left, federalists and sovereigntists. The party will enter its first election under the leadership of former PQ cabinet minister François Legault, a competent manager and a seasoned politician but hardly a charismatic rassembleur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the polls suggest the CAQ enjoys considerable support, it may have peaked too soon. Mr. Legault's mantra of on verra (we'll see) is hardly an engaging call to arms, and the new slogan, on doit faire mieux (we must do better), isn't much more inspiring. As the CAQ becomes less of an abstraction, it will face the challenge of turning a small band of refugees from the Action Démocratique du Québec's ashes and a few PQ floor-crossers into a majority government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All three parties will be using their time in the National Assembly to set the tone. Several campaign issues are already evident, including the fundamental question of Quebec's economic future, the persistent tension between the “re-engineering” of the state and the province's social contract, and the unfinished business of cleaning up the mess in the construction industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic leadership is a crucial element for any Quebec government, but no less important is the fundamental role of speaking for Quebeckers and defending their interests in the federation. In fact, with the Bloc Québécois almost vanished from the House of Commons and the relative absence of Quebec voices in the halls of federal power, this role will become even more important at the provincial level. Indeed, the key issue in this election may well be who can stand up for Quebec against Stephen Harper. Quebeckers may be politically hard to read these days, but their antipathy toward the Ottawa Conservatives is palpable and growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On this question, Mr. Legault and the CAQ have very little traction, and even less street cred. At its core, theirs is an inward-looking party, focused on economic and social policy in Quebec with a platform that explicitly refuses to mention constitutional issues and carries no mention of Ottawa or federalism. But Quebec does not exist in a bubble, and Mr. Legault's opponents are hoping to remind voters of this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PQ Leader Pauline Marois has already sounded the alarm, calling Mr. Harper the antithesis of Quebec values: a monarchist, militarist, right-wing social conservative. Her solution: a PQ government that can fight for Quebec “as if it were a country” against the Conservative tide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Charest knows how to use the federalism card to his advantage. He has been relentless in opposing Mr. Harper's gun-control and pension reforms. As a leader among his peers, last month's Council of the Federation meeting showcased how he can act as best defender of Quebec's interests in terms of collaborative federalism with the other premiers.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The term “diaspora” reflects the rise of truly transnational populations occupying a key niche in Canadian politics that allows them to influence both home and host government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diasporas can exert pressure on their home government from abroad, free from political threats and fear of retribution. And they can lobby their host country to put pressure on their home government to endorse policies ranging from human rights and governance reform to favourable international trade policies and security guarantees. Diaspora politics is seductive and populist. And governing parties can ride the wave of new immigrant support for generations.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's a dangerous game. By playing the diaspora card, Canada's leaders are opening up the country to exploitation by other countries looking to disrupt our internal affairs, using diasporas to lobby or influence our leaders or bring their conflicts here. Most Canadian governments have understood, correctly, that our security needs, domestic and international, rest on policies that advance the interests of many diverse groups, not just a few. After all, Canada functions on civic nationalism, so it makes sense to uphold that principle abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why is Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government so keen to play the diaspora card?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, Canada is more and more ethnically diverse, making new Canadians a key battleground for politicians. Like most OECD nations (except the United States), Canada's population is increasing because of immigration, not birth rates. Politicians competing for diasporas fall into the classic dilemma of outbidding, which can lead a government to escalate commitments to extreme and unnecessary levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it's true we see political competition by all parties to win ethnic ridings, it's increasingly apparent that the Harper government has made pandering to diasporas a foreign policy priority. Indeed, as a right-of-centre government, it can hold an even more extreme position on diaspora issues without fear of being outflanked by more centrist or left-leaning parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some might argue that efforts to win over diasporas is a legitimate one as long as it doesn't hamper national interests. Others might suggest that because diasporas have a significant impact in the political realm in their home countries, with the potential to both improve and impair political processes abroad and at home, they need careful watching. Ill-informed parliamentarians remain largely unaware of the intricate agendas that diasporas bring to Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, diaspora lobbying, pressure tactics and special pleading have led to more selective, but not necessarily better, foreign policy choices that play out in terms of targeted aid programs, and other foreign policy initiatives based on constituent interests. Some diasporas are simply better organized, more cohesive and more influential than others. Sometimes, a diaspora will lobby the government to shape policies in favour of a homeland and simultaneously challenge the homeland government through financial and other support to political parties and NGOs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This can create confusion about where Canada really stands. Diaspora influences on foreign aid decisions show in support for Haiti, Jamaica, Sudan, Pakistan and Vietnam. Ukraine also is on the list because Canadians of Ukrainian heritage number more than 1.2 million. Skewing policy in favour of some diasporas and not others inevitably invites invidious comparison, and it encourages new groups to mobilize along ethnic, instead of civic, associations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third, diaspora interests and ideology often coincide, making diaspora support appear strategic. We see how this plays out with an aggressive policy toward Russia that appeals to Canadians from former Soviet satellite states. The Harper government has annoyed several other countries, including Turkey (by recognizing the Armenian genocide), Greece (by recognizing Macedonia as the Republic of Macedonia) and Sri Lanka (over the Tamil refugees). Its recent pronouncements on Israel have raised concerns about whether Canada is capable of an even-handed approach on the Middle East. Mr. Harper's recognition of the Ukrainian Holodomor as an act of genocide has had its critics as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, if one considers the various controversies over the Harper government's decision to fully back certain diasporas, it must be asked whether playing the diaspora card is in Canada's national interest. It's not clear whether there are broader principles underlying this strategy, other than political opportunism. In a time of both economic and political instability, we question the merits of a policy that encourages diasporas to bring their homeland disputes to Canada. Such a policy creates a slippery slope of invidious comparison, promotes political outbidding and erodes civic national identity.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, when a news outlet called PandoDaily.com launched in Silicon Valley to report on the start-up tech scene there, its founder Sarah Lacey announced in a blog post that her new venture would be funded by some of the very same people and companies she intended to cover. But don't worry, she insisted: There would be no conflicts of interest, because she had so many backers – including 10 powerful and wealthy folks like Netscape co-founder and Facebook board member Marc Andreessen, along with seven investment funds holding stakes in dozens of companies – that no single supporter could influence the site's editorial coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The post sparked a brief discussion among commenters on the site, but most readers who knew Lacey from her previous gig at the respected tech news website TechCrunch said they saw no problem with the arrangement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This happened only days after a report that Drew Pinsky – the physician of Celebrity Rehab fame and host of a nightly prime-time show on CNN's HLN network – had been paid $115,000 (U.S.) by Janssen Pharmaceuticals for “consulting services.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The payment was for helping out on one of the company's anti-addiction initiatives. The story got no traction outside a couple of journalism blogs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conflicts of interest, which used to be the third rail of journalism, now seem to be like herpes: something you disclose if you want to build a real relationship, but maybe not if a brief assignation is all you've got in mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in an age when people are receiving information straight from politicians and companies via social media, perhaps it's only crusty journalism profs who care about such things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heather Harde, who until recently was the president of TechCrunch, thinks readers and viewers are much more adept at sniffing out bias than most old-fashioned conflict-of-interest guidelines recognize. “The sense of objectivity is sort of false to begin with,” she said in an interview on Thursday. “So your primary obligation as a writer is to disclose conflicts, whether: ‘This is a co-founder who happens to be a really close friend of mine,' or ‘This is a company in which I'm an angel investor.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our sense is that readers are savvy, and that they'll either then choose to credit or discredit your writing based on your disclosures, and if you're not honest and true with your audience over time, our strong belief was those people will go away. It's a very competitive market and there are lots of places to read tech news, and so if we're not mostly right most of the time, readership easily goes elsewhere.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was speaking about Silicon Valley, where personal and professional ties are terribly knotty, but her words had wider significance about general-interest reporting. “There are all sorts of ways that people are conflicted – sometimes even more by friendships than financial investments that they make,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed. Facing a conflict-of-interest accusation that bordered on pillow talk, the <span class="companylink">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</span> recently responded with a shrug.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last March, Rebecca Scott, who was then the fiancée (and is now the wife) of CBC's British Columbia legislative reporter Stephen Smart, took a job as the deputy press secretary for premier Christy Clark. A viewer complained, and the corporation's ombudsman issued a report last month in which he found the arrangement contravened CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices. “Smart can report with integrity, and CBC's protocol can combine disclosure and recusal, but the pervasive appearance of a conflict of interest will continually challenge their reputations,” noted Kirk Lapointe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CBC's editor-in-chief, Jennifer McGuire, responded last week with a blog post in which she insisted measures were in place to prevent a conflict. Smart will not cover stories “in which Rebecca Scott is the principal or sole spokesperson” or a primary source, wrote McGuire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meeting with the Globe's editorial board last week, CBC president Hubert Lacroix agreed it was an imperfect situation, but one the corporation was willing to live with: “Those are things that happen, we have conflict-of-interest policies, it's not something that's ideal. On this situation, we agree to disagree.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Season two of the megahit British period drama Downton Abbey, the television series that raises the essential question, “Can you really put on a decent dinner party without footmen?” was released this week on DVD. I raced out, bought it, and then spent nine consecutive hours on my couch, gobbling it up, I mean doing research.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You have a life worth living,” sighed one of my closest friends, up to her eyeballs in a bad business day, when she heard what I was doing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not just me. The most addictive British series since the 1980s hit Brideshead Revisited, Downton Abbey, the soapy saga of a grand estate in Yorkshire and the lives and loves of not only its owners – the Earl and Countess of Grantham and their three marriageable daughters – but of their vast domestic staff downstairs – has found giddy favour at a time when much of its audience is financially hurting and obsessed with the notion of class again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't think that's a coincidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. presidential race is replete with back and forths about “class warfare” and President Barack Obama's supposed “war against the rich.” (The President has been sternly talking about people at the top paying their “fair share.”) Prominent Republicans are turning themselves into instant comic canon fodder for comedians like Jon Stewart by intoning, as Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels did, “This is not a nation of the haves and have-nots, it's the haves and soon-to-haves.” (This resulted in a pie chart on The Daily Show, with the “haves” and the “somewhat later to haves.”)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when GOP comer Senator Marco Rubio of Florida taking another stab at finding the upside in a country in which the myth of meritocracy has given way to a shockingly widening gap between the rich and the poor, explained that when Americans drive through rich neighbourhoods, “they don't say we hate the people who live in these nice houses, they say congratulations on your nice house and guess what? We will be joining you here soon”, Mr. Stewart smirked: “There's nothing that rich people like more than poor people circling their neighbourhood at night saying we will be joining you soon.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile a disturbing new book, Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010, by controversial American academic Charles Murray has been met with both criticism and approval even in Republican circles as it argues that “America is coming apart at the seams – not seams of race or ethnicity, but of class.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Mr. Murray, we now have the “cognitive elite” living the gated good life, absorbing their own culture (like Downton Abbey?), safe in their self-perpetuating bubble of good schools, relatively stable marriages and well-paying jobs while the new lower class, unemployed and shorn of religious belief or the promise of a better life, wander morally unmoored in a bleak landscape of family breakdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I found some rueful truth in Mr. Murray's depiction of a self-satisfied cognoscenti who wouldn't be caught dead watching The Bachelorette but claim to know exactly what the audience of such a show is thinking or feeling. And the prospect of a world in which equal opportunity is a myth while only those at the very top plunder and prosper, is of course what fuelled the still percolating Occupy movement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it's no wonder, with high unemployment numbers, continuing foreclosures, stacks of unpaid bills, and a bleak global economic outlook, the haves and the haven't-quite-paid-for-it's alike are feasting their sore eyes on the real-estate porn of a great fictional English country house in the 1900s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it has probably not been lost on many viewers that the current middle-aged Earl, played to gallant perfection by Hugh Bonneville, was forced to marry Cora, an American heiress (Elizabeth McGovern with an odd mid-Atlantic accent) whom he now loves dearly, just to keep that old pile of bricks going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, down in the butler's pantry, where there is more intrigue than you can shake a silver candle snuffer at, almost every servant is dreaming of a better chance in a fairer world.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A drug currently used to fight cancer may also double as a powerful weapon against Alzheimer's disease – a dramatic finding giving hope where little has existed.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a landmark study, U.S. researchers gave bexarotene to mice whose brains were clogged with deposits of amyloid-beta plaque – a potentially harmful protein associated with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After just several days of treatment, 75 per cent of the plaque was cleared from the mouse brains and the rodents experienced a personality transformation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They showed improvements in memory, cognitive abilities, and social behaviour, as well as their sense of smell, according to the findings published Friday in the journal Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The remarkable thing is how efficient this drug is at removing amyloid from the brain,” said the senior researcher, Gary Landreth, at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone's brain produces some amyloid for normal functioning. In healthy individuals, excess levels are routinely removed with the aid of a protein called ApoE. But in people prone to Alzheimer's, amyloid plaque builds up between nerve cells, eventually leading to interference in memory and other mental processes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers believe bexarotene activates a gene that increases the production of ApoE which, in turn, starts rapidly removing the amyloid deposits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What we are doing is stimulating the normal mechanism by which amyloid is cleared from the brain. So we are just revving up Mother Nature, “ explained one of the researchers, Paige Cramer, a doctoral student at the university.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bexarotene seems to provide a ray of hope in a field of research marked by setbacks and failure. There are no known treatments that can halt the mind-robbing disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, Dr. Landreth insisted it's far too soon to consider bexarotene a breakthrough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I would like to say loudly and clearly,” he warned, “we have to be cautious about extrapolating to whether this is going to work in humans.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The genetically engineered mice used in the experiment don't develop the human variant of Alzheimer's. And, in particular, Alzheimer's in humans also involves another protein, called tau, that sometimes forms fibrous tangles, which are linked to the death of brain cells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means bexarotene may be able to rid the human brain of amyloid deposits, but a patient's symptoms might not improve significantly if tau remains a problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers are already making plans for further studies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large-scale human trials could start fairly soon because it has already been demonstrated that patients can tolerate the drug – a key consideration for any new or experimental medication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We know it is safe in people because it has been in use for 10 years,” said Ms. Cramer. “Some of the hoops have already been jumped for us.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bexarotene, also known by the brand name of Targretin, is primarily used to treat a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the skin called cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starving cancer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can restricting calories starve cancer cells into remission?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New research, involving laboratory mice, suggests chemotherapy drugs work much better when they are preceded by brief periods of fasting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cancerous tumours, made up of millions of rapidly dividing cells, are essentially big energy hogs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They need to burn lots of energy just to stay alive,” explains the senior researcher, Valter Longo at the University of Southern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So cutting off their source of nourishment can put them in an extremely vulnerable position, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the study, some of the mice received no food for two days before chemotherapy. They were given only water to prevent dehydration. As a result of fasting, blood glucose levels dropped by 50 per cent. What's more, there was a 70-per-cent plunge in Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) – one of several key ingredients required for tumour growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Normal healthy cells can tolerate brief periods when nutrients are in short supply. They essentially enter a dormant state, similar to hibernation, Dr. Longo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But cancer cells, programmed for unrelenting growth, no longer have the capacity to rest, and they begin to shows signs of collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A blast of chemotherapy, when they are in this weakened state, appears to push some tumours over the edge, according to the findings published this week in the journal Science Translational Medicine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Longo noted that fasting plus chemotherapy is more effective than chemo alone for fighting a wide variety of different cancers in mice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will now take a large clinical trial lasting several years to determine whether this approach also works in humans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Longo and his fellow researchers have nearly completed a small study to determine whether cancer patients can tolerate fasting. In this trial, patients abstained from food for three days before receiving chemotherapy and continued fasting for one additional day. Like the mice, they consumed only water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The preliminary evidence looks promising, but Dr. Longo cautioned that fasting may not be safe for everyone, especially those with other medical conditions such as diabetes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fasting can cause a drop in blood pressure, headaches and other adverse reactions. And if fasting lasts too long, the patient's immune system may suffer and give the cancer the upper hand once more. So, medical teams will have to closely monitor patients involved in clinical trials. “It would be very dangerous for patients to start doing this on their own,” he warned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are heart disease and prostate cancer linked?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same factors that contribute to heart disease may also increase a man's chances of developing prostate cancer, according to researchers at the Duke Cancer Institute in Durham, N.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While analyzing data from participants in a drug trial, they found that men with existing cardiovascular disease faced a 35-per-cent greater risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer during the four-year study compared to those who were free of heart troubles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Obviously this is just one study and it needs to be validated,” said the senior researcher, Stephen Freedland. But the findings suggest that lifestyle changes such as weight loss, exercise and a healthy diet, which are known to prevent heart disease, may also guard against prostate cancer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What's good for the heart may be good for the prostate,” said Jean-Alfred Thomas, one of the authors of the study published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention.</p>

One of us, who gets very emotional when drinking, recently said some unforgivable things to one of the group. Now some of us want to exclude her permanently, and others say no. No one sees her often enough to confront her about her drinking. Advice?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reduce the booze</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe your group would work better if the overall level of alcohol consumption was trimmed back. It sounds as if it could help your wayward friend. You're not teenagers any more. As for the things she said, blame it on the drink and move on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– Michael Moore, Toronto</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confront her</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why doesn't the strongest-minded of your group confront her ahead of the trip? This can be done in a diplomatic way, but if she gets angry and doesn't come with the group, at least you know you were fair to her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– Heather Drope, Halifax</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Try to understand</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A drinker may not know when they have overstepped the boundaries. In a group setting possibly each woman could relate an incident that they were embarrassed about. These indiscretions may elicit an apology for the unforgivable things said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– Alan Strid, Calgary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final word</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I got this, people! Tell your friend you've all finally seen the light, become Muslims and you're heading for Mecca on your next vacay. And since your new faith forbids alcohol or being around anyone who drinks, she won't have any fun, so she needn't come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But before you all thunder off to the mosque, hold on a sec. Heather's right; you're going to have to talk to your friend. You can't exclude her without telling her why.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine the scenario: You all run off to Sin City and sin without her, then she finds out and wonders why she was dumped. Which brings you back to the same problem. See what's happening here? You're in a ruinous circle of hell. Alcohol is a disinhibitor and she needs to know that when she partakes, her oversharing affects her friendships. Then she can make the decision, as Michael suggests, to cut back her alcohol consumption so she won't reach that point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan's idea of sitting around the campfire recounting embarrassing incidents may not work because she doesn't know she said something unforgivable (no one told her). You gals may be acting as enablers. It's possible alcohol may be affecting other aspects of her life as well. She may need this information more than you realize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for the love of Allah, do not send an e-mail. This sort of delicate conversation requires human contact. There's an invention called the phone and people use it to exchange all sorts of useful information. Once an aunt from Pakistan called to tell us Grandma died. This contraption works even when there's an ocean between you – never mind cities. So ladies, stop eyeing those hijabs and grow a pair (breasts don't count). Tell your friend the truth. Trust me, it'll be easier than praying five times a day.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to contraception, you cannot tell an average American Catholic from a non-Catholic. Both use it in equal proportion, in spite of the church's edict against it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, in a calmer country, Barack Obama's move to force Catholic universities and hospitals to include free contraception coverage in their employee health-care plans might have been interpreted as a simple recognition of how most Americans live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, in the United States, sex, politics and religion are explosive enough on their own that the President must have known the mischief he would sow by raising an issue that amalgamates all three. And sure enough, he has set off a battle in the culture wars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans have labelled the administration's move an all-out assault on religious protections included in the Constitution. For them, it bespeaks growing government intrusiveness under a President who always errs on the side of the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republican House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner called the new rule “an unambiguous attack on religious freedom in our country” and vowed to table legislation to block its implementation. Florida Senator Marco Rubio reprimanded the President in Spanish. Republicans feel they have found an issue that resonates with Hispanic voters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Candidates for the Republican presidential nomination are also getting mileage out of the “contraception decree.” Rick Santorum's surprising surge in Minnesota and Colorado caucuses partly reflected his move to mobilize GOP voters against it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The President and his advisers intensely debated the risks and rewards of mandating free contraception among the preventive care coverage required under the new health-care law. While the Catholics around him, including Vice-President Joe Biden, warned against the move, Mr. Obama concluded the GOP would alienate centrist voters and women by opposing a measure most Americans support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Their calculation was that, if you're religiously conservative enough to see this as an assault on religious liberty, you probably weren't going to vote for Obama anyway,” said Dante Scala, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire. “And for Republicans, another culture war is a poor substitute for running an election on the economy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is too early to know whether the White House made the right assumptions. But it is safe to say it did not bank on the vehemence with which religious authorities have denounced the President. Nor did it expect so much blowback from its own side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two prominent Democratic senators facing re-election this year – Pennsylvania's Bob Casey and West Virginia's Joe Manchin – have joined Republicans on the issue. So has Tim Kaine, the former Virginia governor who is running for the Senate this fall. Other Democratic senators facing voters in November have provided a testy “no comment.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the so-called conscience clause, Catholic parishes will be exempt from covering birth control in employee health plans. But the White House has insisted that larger Catholic employers must comply with the new requirement by mid-2013, though it has vowed to work with them to “allay some of their concerns.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You are going to have folks of all faiths who work for those large institutions,” said White House press secretary Jay Carney on Tuesday. “Those women ought to be able to have access to the same contraceptive services that other women will have access to.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Catholic-run institutions remain linchpins in American health care and education. The more than 600 Catholic hospitals in the United States employ about 650,000 workers and provide care for one in six U.S. patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are 244 Catholic postsecondary institutions, including Georgetown University, Notre Dame and Boston College. While they would be required to provide contraceptive coverage to their employees, it remains unclear whether they would also have to do so for their 720,000 students. Most campus clinics currently do not provide free birth control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be naive to suggest the White House did not envision a political payback in making a decision that delighted Mr. Obama's liberal base, which will be critical in providing the energy and volunteers the President needs to win re-election this fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision was also based on research showing that half of all U.S. pregnancies are unintended and that four in 10 of those pregnancies end in abortion. The data also showed that cost is a major reason many American women do not use birth control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Republicans – typically proponents of putting more God in government – may have a stronger argument by standing up for the separation of church and state.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The matter in dispute is whether a light rail transit line should be entirely underground or partly on the surface. The cost of burying the whole line would be $1.9-billion.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ford is a great advocate of subways – rightly – but he is disproportionately disdainful of streetcars, and is determined not to deprive automobiles of any of the space they now have on the city's roads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mayor insists that the overall $8.4-billion plan is a provincial project, so that the council is not the relevant decision-maker. In fact, Dalton McGuinty, the Premier of Ontario, consented to the fully underground line – a change from the plan agreed to in 2009 – in order to accommodate Mr. Ford when his election mandate was fresh. This is not a case of the Ontario government insisting on the more expensive option. On the contrary, Mr. McGuinty made clear on Thursday that the council's approval is required for the whole project to proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ford's preference for subways is well founded and widely shared. And the underlying, long-term wealth of Toronto is more than sufficient for a steady program of subway building, but the fiscal relationships – past and present – among the various levels of government have got in the way of wise transportation policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is no time for the quixotic Mr. Ford to attempt an ideal transit system. Both the Harper and the McGuinty governments are evidently preparing strenuously deficit-reducing budgets. And in any case, the treasuries of upper-level governments should be treated respectfully; after all, federal, provincial and municipal taxpayers are not separate groups of people.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's major banks pulled back on historic-low mortgage offers this week by raising their posted rates. But that doesn't mean the deep discounting seen over the last month has necessarily ended.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several of the banks are still unofficially offering deep discounts in the mortgage market through brokers and in-branch negotiations, while some credit unions say they are holding firm on rate offers brought in last month to compete with the banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the country's biggest banks began offering four-year or five-year fixed-rate mortgages at 2.99 per cent in mid-January after <span class="companylink">Bank of Montreal</span> lowered its rates in an unusual two-week offer designed to kick-start new mortgages in a slow period for sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But soon after BMO's two-week offer expired, rival banks began pulling their offers. <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span> and <span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion Bank</span> announced this week they were halting their offers of 2.99 per cent on 30-year amortizations, which they planned to offer until the end of the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</span> followed suit on Thursday, announcing it was also raising its posted rate for a four-year fixed-rate mortgage to 3.39 per cent, up from 2.99 per cent The banks say the increases in posted rates are due to increased funding costs as bond yields start to climb. However, despite the movement in posted rates, the discounting has continued – albeit unofficially. Three mortgage brokers who detailed the offerings in the market in different parts of the country said special discount rates remain on offer, despite the formal announcements from the banks that those rates have been scrapped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, some credit unions are also not budging. Dave Schurman, executive vice-president of FirstOntario Credit Union, which operates in southern Ontario, said his financial institution has no plans to halt its special offer early, as the banks did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FirstOntario, which has about 85,000 members and $2.9-billion in funds under management, is one of a few credit unions that announced fixed-rate, four-year mortgages of 2.98 per cent to compete with the banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We said we would keep it until the end of February, and we're not going to pull that back like the banks did,” Mr. Schurman said. “I can't see that much changing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schurman added the market remains tight in terms of banks and credit unions battling for new mortgages. “It's pretty competitive,” he said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa has been trying to caution consumers against borrowing too much in a low interest rate environment, worried that household debt levels across the country are rising too quickly. Sources have indicated officials in Ottawa were not happy with the price war the banks had been waging on mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, brokers said a variety of banks, including TD, Royal and BMO, continue to entertain new loans at the discounted rate, even though the posted rates have been increased. Many of those talks depends on the eligibility of the borrower, one broker added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though January and February is traditionally a slow time for mortgage sales, banks and credit unions are gearing up for the busy spring season, which begins in March and usually lasts until May or June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's big banks will begin reporting earnings data for the first quarter, which ended Jan. 31, at the end of this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the numbers won't show the full impact of the recent price battle between the lenders, analysts will be keeping a close eye on mortgage originations and refinancing at each lender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The banks haven't disclosed yet whether they have seen an increase in business as a result of the special rates.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was in <span class="companylink">H&amp;M</span> the other day to buy my girlfriend underwear. It was accidental. She'd just called and, while chatting, said she really needed some, so I decided to surprise her.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe I hadn't psychologically prepared myself, or maybe I'm just a shy guy about these things, but almost immediately upon walking into the lingerie section of <span class="companylink">H&amp;M</span>, my body temperature rose 10 degrees. At my left was a rack of sheer body suits with pink bows drawing one's eyes to where they already naturally go, and to my right, a rainbow cornucopia of panties covering an entire wall. I started to sweat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It happened so fast I was unable to take off my jacket for fear of looking like a weird sweaty guy looking at women's underwear. Also, it crossed my mind that I was, in fact, a weird sweaty guy looking at women's underwear. Of course, in a way, aren't we all?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Valentine's Day this year, I faced the fear, walked into shops and collected tips for all the men out there who want to overcome any lingering lingerie-buying phobias.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keep it in the neighbourhood</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ideally, the woman you're buying for will already frequent a store. Find out what it is because they will have her measurements on file. If not, take the initiative and get to know a local lingerie dealer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most likely, he or she will even be able to sell you something made within a few kilometres of your home. “I don't do alterations,” says Maureen Myers, owner of Nearly Naked in Toronto, “but something good about buying locally is that I can put clients in touch with the designers for minor adjustments. And there have been some women who have had things custom made.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now there's a sexy and sustainable new meaning for “locavore.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might think you know her size</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When a man says he knows her size, the first thing I ask is, ‘Is that English or French?'” says Shana Tilbrook, owner of Tryst in Toronto. “There's a two-cup size difference between, for instance, an English G and a French G.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm sure this is less complicated than calculus, but not by a whole lot. According to Ms. Tilbrook, who has trained bra store employees across Canada for 15 years, there are 200 different sizes of bras and each company's fit is unique. So sneak into your woman's drawer and snag a few different examples from different brands, then let the fitters triangulate the data to accurately assess the area above the underwire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it's too late for covert operations, go with something loose-fitting like a chemise or a baby doll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't go basic</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Ms. Myers, if your honey doesn't own any sexy underwear, it doesn't mean she won't be into it. “A lot of women buy what is utilitarian, what's going to get them through the work day,” she says. And although they will venture into lace once they've covered the basics, some never get that far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, if you are buying for a “first timer,” help ease her into it. “Not all women are comfortable with their body,” says John Izzo, vice-president of design and product development of Montreal-based chain La Vie En Rose. “Most have one part they are self-conscious about. … You should offer lingerie but also give her a cover-up – a kimono, a wrap or a robe made of satin or silk. This will make her feel less vulnerable, because she can decide when to slip it off.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vintage is in style</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Myers showed me a champagne-coloured vintage nightgown made by Mary Green, a San-Francisco-based designer, which was modelled after one that Ms. Green's mother-in-law had given her. “I have something nice my aunt gave me. Some people pass things down. You know, if it doesn't fit any more,” Ms. Myers said, with a wink. While the recycling trend may not have reached the underwear drawer in your household, there's plenty of hot vintage styles in stores right now so you can pretend it has.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sex doesn't end after kids</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I know. Duh. However, I was surprised to hear from Jennifer Klein, owner of Secrets From Your Sister in Toronto, that families frequently come into the shop. “The father will take care of the children while the mother is having a fitting,” says Ms. Klein. “They might be tired, but they need to refurbish their relationship a little bit. … Bringing lingerie into the scene at that point is doing something to appreciate each other.” For those extra eager to get back into the swing of things, Ms. Klein even carries a black lace nightie with a snap-on shoulder strap for breast-feeding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Set the right mood for your gift</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Pretend the bedroom is a stage and the night is a play,” says Mr. Izzo. “Make the lighting dim, put on some romantic music and wrap the gift in something pretty and soft. Remember to chill some champagne.” Of course, this mood won't turn every lady's crank. La Vie En Rose also offers glow-in-the-dark bras and body paint for the girl who might be less Barry White and more Montreal techno-dance party.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“'Cause he is. He's our MVP.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And not only the most valuable player of the <span class="companylink">Nashville Predators</span>, the team's long-time coach adds, but MVP of the entire league, a goaltender worthy of the Hart Memorial Trophy when this 2011-12 season is finished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A good case can be made for this argument. The Predators, decidedly young, with no superstar in the lineup – some would say with no true NHL calibre first line – are tied with the St. Louis Blues for the third best record in the tough Western Conference. In 55 games after Thursday night's 4-3 loss to the Ottawa Senators, the Predators had 69 points, 65 of them thanks to Rinne's 30-12-5 record and, before Thursday's game, his sparkling .925 save percentage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senators broke a seven-game losing streak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We wouldn't be in the position we are right now if it wasn't for Pekka,” Trotz says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He is hands down the best goalie I have ever played with or against,” says 21-year-old defenceman Ryan Ellis. “We even celebrate when we score on him in practice.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rinne is one of hockey's most amusing and inspirational stories. He played goal because his older cousin wanted to practise his shot in road hockey. He starred in pesapallo, a Finnish game that is a cross between baseball and rounders, and he credits it with shaping his remarkable eye-hand co-ordination. He was good enough to make the local elite hockey team, Karpat, but not good enough to displace the No. 1 goaltender, Niklas Backstrom, now in the NHL with the Minnesota Wild.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nashville's European scout, Janne Kekalainen, thought the Predators should have a good look at this gangling – 6 foot 5 – goaltender backing Backstrom, so then assistant general manager Ray Shero, now GM of the Pittsburgh Penguins, flew over to see for himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Ray only came for one game,” Rinne says. “They told me I would be playing, but then I wasn't. So he only pretty much saw me in warm-up. It's a good story. I was fortunate.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Predators obviously only took a flier on him. They waited until the eighth round, their 10th pick of the day, and took him as the 258th player chosen that day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Players taken that deep in the draft rarely make it, and rarely star.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took time in the minors, where Rinne filled out and would likely be talked about as the biggest goaltender in the NHL if he weren't already the smallest goaltender on the Predators; little-used backup Anders Lindback is 6 foot 6, 203 pounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rinne is too young to remember when goalies were the little kid who couldn't skate. But he does recognize that today's monster goaltenders are different than anything that has gone before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a big advantage,” he says, “just covering more. It gives you more reach. Being a smaller guy, you have to be a better skater and faster. You have to read the game really well, when to go down and when to stay up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For a bigger guy, the game is so fast, you still have to know when to use your size and when to use your reactions.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rinne, obviously, has both assets and puts them to excellent use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He won 11 consecutive games in January through the first week of this month. His 24 shutouts are the most of any NHL goaltender over the past four seasons. He is the best goalie when it comes to the goaltender nightmare known as the shootout, having stopped 95 of the 122 game-ending breakaways he has faced. They still talk about The Save he made in overtime against the Vancouver Canucks, when he came out of nowhere, leaping across his own crease like a pesapallo shortstop (if they have them) to steal a sure goal from Kevin Bieksa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No wonder that back on Nov. 3, his birthday, the Predators signed him to the largest contract in the franchise's history: $49-million (U.S.) over seven years. That night he shut out the Phoenix Coyotes 3-0.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is because of play like this that Trotz, who always used to talk about how his team had to work hard and play smart just to be competitive, now has a bit of a new tune to him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're past the stage of just wanting to be competitive,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We want the Cup.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The public rarely sees how stories are made in the mainstream media. But the recent news about Quebec City's preparedness for the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> offers a unique exception. It also gives insight into how the In Plain Sight principle works in Canadian media.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Viewers watching Tuesday's Prime Time Sports on Sportsnet, or listening on Sportsnet Fan 590 Radio, heard an interview with Quebec City lawyer Marcel Aubut, ostensibly about his role as chairman of the Canadian Olympic Association. As the chat neared an end, host Bob McCown casually segued into asking Aubut about the odds of Quebec City getting the financially strapped Phoenix Coyotes. Specifically, when could they have a new arena up and running?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any time now, Aubut said. The financing is in place for a new arena and we're ready to go, he said. The news about a shovel-ready arena surprised both McCown and co-host Stephen Brunt. Clearly, neither had any idea that the arena plans were so advanced and said so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aubut was excused, and when PTS came back from commercial, Hockey Central host Daren Millard was sitting at the desk with a quizzical expression, asking, Did I hear correctly? To answer that question, Brunt's former colleague at The Globe and Mail, Sean Gordon, was brought on the line. McCown asked Gordon if Aubut was correct about the arena plans. Yup, Gordon said, with a few caveats they are ready, and the money is in place. Everyone here in Quebec knows, Gordon said in so many words.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next day, Brunt's blog on Sportsnet.ca was all about … a new arena being a given in Quebec. The topic also became fodder for sports talk radio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not criticism of McCown and Brunt. This could have happened to any of us in our business. It just happened live on TV and radio where everyone can see. And that, ladies and germs, is how journalism sometimes happens. Often we just get stories straight from left field.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, and not all stories originate in Toronto. Take that to Ryerson and smoke it, kids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let chords</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The term love in tennis allegedly comes from the French word oeuf, meaning egg or zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is interesting because you wonder which came first – the chicken of current Canadian success from emerging talent such as Milos Raonic and Vasek Pospisil or the egg of Sportsnet's commitment to Davis Cup tennis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The singles' success of Raonic and the Davis Cup heroics of Pospisil and veteran Daniel Nestor has neatly dovetailed with the platform Sportsnet has given them. (Raonic, in particular, is a pet project of Sportsnet, appearing everywhere on its five TV channels and radio programs.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whichever it is, Sportsnet has made a significant investment in tennis, which last time we looked is something less than the sports sensation of the nation. Even though rival TSN controls the major Grand Slam tournaments such as Wimbledon, the U.S. Open and the Australian Open (showing CBS, NBC or ESPN coverage) Sportsnet is going all-in with its own coverage of this weekend's Davis Cup as an attempt to be the network of choice for the sport in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After sending a full crew to Israel for the qualifying matches last year, Sportsnet is fully staffing this weekend's matches in Vancouver with singles action Friday (at 5 p.m. ET) and continuing through the weekend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beating the mighty French squad of Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Gael Monfils will be a far cry from subduing Israel or Peru, but it will be a great test for the young Canadians as they enter the elite level of the Davis Cup for the first time since 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sportsnet just hopes that it can get an outcome that lasts till Sunday's final singles matches to maximize viewership.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With apologies to our favourite sportswriter's son, Neil Young, this weekend at the Air Canada Centre should be dubbed the Ragged Glory tour.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Toronto Raptors play the Boston Celtics Friday night and the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday afternoon, while the Toronto Maple Leafs face the Montreal Canadiens on Saturday. That's 57 combined league titles rolling into town, but No. 58 doesn't seem to be in the offing in 2012, does it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lakers are just two years removed from their last title, have Kobe Bryant, and appear poised to do a better job of cheating father time in this bizarre, lockout-compressed NBA regular season than the Celtics. But winning the title is another matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Celtics' best-case scenario – win one last crown with Ray Allen (36), Kevin Garnett (36) and Paul Pierce (34) – was thrown into disarray when 25-year-old Jeff Green was sidelined for the year with an aortic aneurysm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadiens' glory days are as forgotten as a Scott Gomez goal celebration (oh, so that's what it looks like), or common sense from general manager Pierre Gauthier. Oh for a dynasty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But ahead of this one-time visit by the Holy Trinity, Toronto's three general managers – Brian Burke of the Maple Leafs, Bryan Colangelo of the Raptors and Alex Anthopoulos of the Blue Jays – think we won't see dynasties again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Only the media talk about and promote dynasties any more,” Colangelo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Every sport is different, but generally the [collective agreement] dictates there is far too much player movement to allow a true dynasty.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time the Celtics, Canadiens and Lakers were all in top form at the same time was 1985 to 1989.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1986, the Canadiens, backstopped by goaltender Patrick Roy, beat the Calgary Flames in the first of two trips to the final for the Canadiens in a four-year span, and the Celtics and Lakers alternated NBA titles. Those were the days of Magic Johnson and Showtime, and the Celtics of Larry Bird.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Magic and Bird,” Colangelo said. “I mean, the Celtics and Lakers pushed each other to the absolute core.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was that head-to-head battle that made the dynastic rivalry special.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Michael Jordan didn't have a protagonist,” Colangelo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You see ersatz versions every now and then – Burke talks about his Anaheim Ducks acquiring Chris Pronger in a move “aimed absolutely at [the Detroit Red Wings'] Nick Lidstrom,” – but that isn't Lakers vs. Celtics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back then you were a Bird guy or a Magic guy. Burke was a lawyer in Boston, and when pressed, sided with the locals. Colangelo was a college student whose father ran the Phoenix Suns, and that put him in Magic's camp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Larry was obviously special, but Magic was Showtime and everything L.A,” Colangelo said. “The Lakers were rivals and I just had more of a connection to his dominance.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So that leaves the deciding vote to Anthopoulos, who was 9 and a student at Montreal's Lower Canada College in 1985-86. He gets props for running out Sergio Momesso's name off that roster, but making a call on Bird or Magic is tough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anthopoulos is now an NBA fan in part, he believes, because his scout's sensibilities are drawn to the game's athleticism. After admitting he “caught Magic late career, Bird not so much,” Anthopoulos crunched some numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Truthfully, I didn't think it would be close,” Anthopoulos said, almost apologetically. “Bird, I remember mostly from the three-point shooting contests [during NBA all-star games].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I value a point guard more, to begin with, and I knew Magic also played centre sometimes, which gave him huge value to his team. But seeing all those MVPs and championships, seeing how Bird averaged 10 rebounds and almost two steals a game. I might have to go with Bird.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, to have that choice again.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The census confirmed what everyone knew: The population is growing faster in Western Canada than elsewhere. The issue for the fastest-growing provinces, Alberta and Saskatchewan, is what to do with the challenges of growth. Their populations are expanding, pure and simple, because of natural resources, notably oil (mostly from the tar sands), natural gas and potash.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are long-term development issues swirling around the nature of their economies. Are they going to be classic rentier economies, extracting resources and shipping them? Or are they going to try to process more of the resources at home? Thus far, the answer has been the former.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With more people come demands for a necessary expansion of public services: schools, serviced land, police, roads and, of course, health. Outside Alberta, for example, people hear about right-wing politics, the populist Wildrose Alliance (quietly supported by many federal Conservative MPs), the perpetually governing Conservatives, low taxes, small government. The picture, so alluring to those who judge the province by rhetoric rather than reality, is somewhat out of focus because the gap between right-wing rhetoric and on-the-ground facts is large.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta has very big government. Its ratio of civil servants to population is high, relative to elsewhere in Canada. Its public services are large and well-funded, again compared with everywhere else. Thursday's budget didn't touch those services, except to pour more money into them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Alberta keeps its taxes low: no sales tax, relatively lower personal and income taxes. How does it perform this enviable fiscal miracle: low taxes but high spending? It sure isn't because of red-blooded right-wingers in the provincial government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One line item in every Alberta budget shows how the miracle unfolds: non-renewable energy resources. Last year, Alberta took in $8.6-billion in personal income taxes, $3.6-billion in corporate income taxes, $3.8-billion in “other” revenue, $4.7-billion in federal transfers and $8.3-billion in resource revenues. In other words, oil and gas revenues (about half of which – $4.1-billion – came from tar sands oil) poured almost as much money into the Alberta treasury as personal income taxes. What provincial government wouldn't love that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's budget projected a staggering $15.9-billion in non-renewable resource revenues, most of which will be spent. All Premier Alison Redford would say is that she plans a “conversation” with Albertans about reducing reliance on non-renewable revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Decades ago, with the oil and gas industry beginning to boom, Alberta's wisest postwar premier, Peter Lougheed, pondered this bonanza. Being a real conservative – that is, someone who wanted to conserve and preserve – Mr. Lougheed invited his fellow citizens to put some of their riches into a fund for tomorrow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus was born the Heritage Fund, an idea brilliant in conception, flawed in execution. As of September, the Heritage Fund contained $14.7-billion. More than 35 years since inception, the fund has produced $32-billion in revenue for Albertans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It sounds to the uninitiated like a mountain, but it's actually a molehill. Had the Lougheed vision been implemented, the fund would contain at least $100-billion and now produce perhaps $5-billion a year. But successive Alberta governments – not real but faux conservatives – spent rather than saved, figuring, one presumes, that resource revenues would just keep pouring into the treasury. And most politicians, even of the ostensibly most conservative variety, really, really like to spend to get re-elected. (See Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and Stephen Harper.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These faux conservatives also accepted the mantra that the province should not have a sales tax, which, of course, meant even further reliance on those resource revenues to maintain munificent public services. And they apparently believed it useful for Alberta to have among the lowest royalty regimes in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A blue-ribbon panel (made up of Albertans and non-Albertans) charged with examining Alberta's future recommended an end to using resource revenues in this way. It urged putting the revenues into the Heritage Fund and raising taxes to finance more of today's spending. An earlier report for the Canada West Foundation had suggested putting a third of resource revenues into the fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Predictably, these save-for-tomorrow ideas were rejected by previous Alberta governments, as they were again Thursday. Governing for the very long term, after all, is politically dangerous.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gaps in the education system for aboriginal Canadians revealed by a national panel on Thursday are something no Canadian should have to put up with. That panel, set up by the Harper government and the Assembly of First Nations, has produced sensible recommendations for building an effective system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Continued leadership from Prime Minister Stephen Harper and John Duncan, the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs, is needed to put that system in place, but native chiefs, too, need to lead, and a good number of them boycotted the panel.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After visiting 25 First Nations schools, the panel described the gaps as startling. No regular reporting on a child's educational attainment. Inadequate or non-existent early literacy and numeracy programs, and no clear literacy programs to help children who fall behind. No functioning system for the assessment and support of special needs. Schools in substandard, unsafe physical condition, without plans to fix. No consistent practice around teacher certification, discipline or regulation, around monitoring of children's attendance, around ensuring school is safe for children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, filling these intolerable gaps will cost more money. Education budgets across Canada have been growing at a 6-per-cent annual rate, but those increases have largely bypassed aboriginal communities, despite their high birth rate and dire needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be wrong, though, to be hung up on money. The system is opaque and lacks accountability. Canadians don't even know how much money is being spent on aboriginal education – the panel itself didn't offer a figure in the report. And the system doesn't know how the children are doing – the tracking and testing done in the rest of the country are largely absent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The education of aboriginal children and teens should be on the same Canadian sustainability agenda as trade with Asia, retirement-income security and improvements to science and technology programs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When representatives of the Osoyoos Indian Band Development Corp. met with Solicitor-General Shirley Bond last April to offer part of their reserve land for the province's next prison, they had assembled a formidable pitch.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team was able to offer a “shovel-ready” location at a new, multimillion-dollar industrial park. The corporation could show a track record of managing major projects – $220-million worth of capital spending over the past decade and ISO 9001 certification – a seal of quality management. Plus, it could raise capital through municipal-type bonds (a first in Canada for a native band). It meant the team could offer not only a location, but the option of financing to build the prison as a private-public partnership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not in the PowerPoint presentation but equally powerful was Chief Clarence Louie's entourage. He brought the local mayors and MLA, the head of the local college and other regional backers. The message: No big threat of a community backlash here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a politically volatile endeavour, this business of finding a home for a maximum-security prison. Of the 15 local governments invited to bid, only five communities volunteered to host the facility, and one – Penticton – had to withdraw because of public opposition. (Lumby stayed in the running, but struggled with a divisive “no prison” campaign.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As well, the B.C. Liberal government was still smarting from the previous provincial election, when a backlash against a plan to open a prison in Burnaby erupted into a damaging campaign issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Louie's demonstration of support – he was also armed with referendum results showing his people backed the bid – would be especially attractive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the government stalled on a decision while concerns about the province's overloaded criminal justice system mounted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, the province named the Osoyoos bid the winner. It appears the decision had to wait until Premier Christy Clark had assembled a package of justice system announcements. Because the government took more than a year to pick a location, relief of overcrowding in prisons won't likely come until 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the entrepreneurial Osoyoos Indian Band, it's a small delay. They've been preparing for this kind of project for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The band earmarked land for an industrial park 40 years ago. But first nations communities have always been hampered by the need to raise capital – reserve land can't be mortgaged. The Osoyoos band, through the national First Nations Finance Authority, recently found a way around that. It can now issue bonds just like municipal, provincial or federal governments. With revenues from the band's winery, golf course, luxury hotel and other ventures as collateral, it can finance future projects at lower rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The details of how the prison will be built and who will carry the financial risk are being negotiated between B.C. and the Osoyoos. Under the provincial government's rules, every publicly funded construction project worth more than $50-million has to be considered for a public-private partnership (P3).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Details aside, it means jobs for the wider community. Of the Osoyoos Indian Band's 475 members, 228 are of working age. The band currently provides 785 full-time jobs on the reserve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is a community that is doing very well,” said the band corporation's chief operating officer, Brian Titus. The objective here, he said, is diversification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for their neighbours in the South Okanagan, where two major employers have shut down in the past few years, the work can't start quickly enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is a huge story for us,” said Oliver mayor Ron Hovanes. Other communities reacted to the prison proposal with alarm. In his town, six kilometres from the prison site, fears were largely superseded by the attraction of jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where others see a prison, the mayor sees a $200-million capital project that will create 1,000 person-years of construction work and the equivalent of 240 permanent full-time jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Oliver, families had to fight last year to keep an elementary school from closing due to low enrolment. And a new high school is under construction after a fire destroyed the old one. Now Mr. Hovanes can look forward to filling its classrooms. “It bodes well,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PRISON PLANNING</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, Clarence Louie, Osoyoos Indian Band chief, toured a number of prisons as part of a Correctional Service Canada review, which helped convince him to push for his community to have a role in building B.C.'s next prison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aboriginals make up 5 per cent of B.C.'s population, but 25 per cent of its inmates. Mr. Louie sees a chance to offer better programs and to hire prison staff more reflective of the population it serves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Panel recommendations:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rehabilitation must be “a shared accountability,” with offenders required to work to address their risks and needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eliminating drugs from prisons was highlighted a priority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The creation of more job training opportunities so offenders leave prison with skills to join the work force.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘Here's how the game works, you guys,” Jian Gomeshi says before describing the rules of the reality-TV-style CBC Canada Reads “debate” to the champions of the five books involved. Four days, four debates. In the end, one book “survives” to embrace one year of excellent sales. The debaters are not writers. They are attractive, smart personalities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Writers spend years researching, writing and editing each book. Our work is vocational and, as with most vocations, it pays poorly. A recent Writers' Union of Canada report said we earned an average of less than $12,000 a year for our writing. We mostly work at other jobs, though I would argue that there is no Canadian writer who doesn't wish to live solely from writing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada Reads provides one way for that to happen. A book that makes it to the final round will see a new life in terms of reviews and attention. Pulling one's book from such a process – while not impossible – would be a hard call. Every writer wants her book read and admired, not to mention bought, and every publisher wishes to see its investment succeed. So, where is my complaint?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Canada Reads first aired, in 2002, a number of authors were panelists. They submitted five books, from which one was chosen to be theirs to defend. To some extent, these two details mitigated the lowbrow aspects of the central concept. It was more debate than game. The author panelists lent credence to the conversation, and books were discussed in depth. In the past two years, the system the CBC has used to select books has become increasingly bread and circuses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Canada Reads instigated an online public recommendation system. Writers savvy with self-promotion flogged their work, pleading, in some cases, for votes. Scrolling along the Canada Reads Web page was what I came to refer to as “the Twitter feed of desperation.” I felt sick about it. It was wrong that writers should have to beg. It belittled the book in which they had so invested themselves; it also created an atmosphere of unpleasant competition in a very small community. Writing is about conversation, and that conversation lags and dies when the topic becomes as mundane as “which book is best?” How does this book work or not work is a conversation. My book is better than yours because it sold more copies is not. Try it at a cocktail party. Guaranteed conversation stopper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada Reads, strategic voting has supplanted investigation, so that no real substantive inquiry into how the books work is necessary. The debaters and the host can operate on the superficial landscape of whether a book is Canadian enough, or whether they “like” the characters. A writer would never argue a story on this level. Likeability doesn't really interest us. Being Canadian enough doesn't enter our heads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Controversy means attention, and attention for the broadcaster is important. But this type of attention (I wanted X to win!) does nothing to develop a healthy national space for writing. It brands certain books as best, against the reality of the many books the public will never hear of since their authors or publishers were not as successful at promoting them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't difficult to see why this might be bad for readers too. Reading and writing are connected pursuits, private, intellectual and emotional. Readers need to be trained to read properly. I know that sounds snotty. I don't mean it to. I simply mean that there is a meaning to the way a book is put together, and that meaning is important to why the book was put together the way it was. It might be important that the protagonist is unlikeable. It might be imperative that a book challenges what you think a Canadian experience might look like. Books change us, but not if we don't read and think deeply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, Canada Reads decided to bring attention to non-fiction titles, problematizing their “game” further. I'm sure the CBC wasn't expecting accusations – toward authors – of terrorism and lying, but they didn't surprise me. Such attacks mean only more attention. It doesn't matter which book is best because this format seeks only to promote itself. And in this endeavour, the CBC is bottom-feeding on culture, a type of consumption that is extremely damaging to the future of writing and reading in this country.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had chatted “with a bloke who, in referring to certain people's inexperience in their line of work, said that they were ‘green behind the ears.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I suggested that inexperienced people were either ‘green' or ‘wet behind the ears,' but not a portmanteau combination.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bloke responded with “a somewhat snippy e-mail in support of ‘green behind,' citing a reference book whose title wasn't Boys' Big Book of Idioms, and furthermore President Obama himself used ‘green behind etc.' Well, I thought, still wrong, but at least wrong in good company. But now I wonder. Was I right or was I being a stuffy old pedant, which tends to be my default?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moore is right. “Green behind the ears” makes no sense, unless it's a medical condition in dire need of treatment. The phrase was born of a confusion of the two elements he noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Green (grene in Old English), which comes from the same Germanic roots as grow, entered the language referring both to the colour and to new growth in spring. By the 1500s, the word also meant immature and inexperienced, and by the 1600s, naive and gullible.</p>

The Oxford English Dictionary finds its first printed mention in a 1931 book of British soldiers' slang, where it is called “a term of reproach imputing ignorance or youth.” The reference is to calves and other mammals that, when born, remain wet behind the ears for a short while after other body parts have dried.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever its demerits, “green behind the ears” has been around for at least three decades. In a 1981 New York Times article, Richard A. Fandrich, publisher of The Christian Yellow Pages, conceded he had gone too far in discriminating against people who weren't Christians. “I was green behind the ears,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oprah Winfrey used it in a Chicago Tribune interview last May about her early days in television. Her Baltimore co-host didn't like her. “First of all, he wanted to be alone from the beginning. And then, if he had to have a co-host, he didn't want a young, green-behind-the-ears one like me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yes, Obama used it while campaigning for the U.S. presidency in October of 2008. During a debate with Republican contender John McCain, he said, “Now, Senator McCain suggests that somehow, you know, I'm green behind the ears and, you know, I'm just spouting off, and he's sombre and responsible.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expression drew fire early on. In a 1988 Los Angeles Times column, Jack Smith included it with several other malapropisms, a term derived from Mrs. Malaprop, who in the 1775 play The Rivals was given to such utterances as, “She's as headstrong as an allegory on the banks of the Nile.” Smith offered a recent example: that Europe in the Middle Ages “was devastated by the platonic plague.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a Chicago Tribune column in 1985, R.C. Longworth called such phrases “fruitworthy English,” because “former mayor Jane Byrne one day said she hoped a certain investigation would ‘prove fruitworthy.' It's the sort of English that sounds okay until you stop to think about it, whereupon it falls apart.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Longworth told of an executive “who warns against over-enthusiasm by urging his subordinates, ‘Don't bend overboard!” One of his readers “had heard a senior officer at his firm tell about the good old days ‘when I was still green behind the ears.'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately, the correct expression is in regular rotation. The Winnipeg Sun used it on Jan. 31: “Spencer Machacek isn't your typical wet-behind-the-ears rookie.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since someone is bound to ask, nobody knows exactly where rookie came from, but one line of speculation is that it derived from rook, the verb meaning to swindle, since new recruits are often gullible – that is, green. Full stop.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everywhere Boston Celtics head coach Doc Rivers turns these days, he runs smack into Father Time.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NBA all-star teams are announced, and Boston forward Kevin Garnett, a 14-time selection, isn't chosen. He's been there every year since 1997, with the exception of 1999, when another NBA lockout cancelled the game. Meanwhile, Rivers's 19-year-old son, Austin, is a star freshman guard at Duke University who hit a game-winning shot last Wednesday to beat North Carolina. He'll be coming to the NBA some time soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, there are nights like Friday: the tail-end of back-to-back games after an 88-87 overtime loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We were awful,” Rivers lamented – and that was before the Toronto Raptors slapped the Celtics 86-74 in the first of a seven-game, two-week homestand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one of the rare times this season, the Raptors seized an opponent and didn't let go – youthful legs carrying them to a 26-14 first-quarter lead that was so comprehensive that at one point Rivers called a 20-second timeout 10 seconds after a previous time-out to tear into his team for failing to execute a play, turning his back on them and returning to the bench to let guard Rajon Rondo do the duties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rivers huddled with his assistants in the hallway beside the dressing room after the game, drawing a curtain to keep out prying eyes. Chris Wilcox appeared to receive most of his wrath during the timeout, but no names were mentioned as Rivers fought to keep an edge from his voice as he talked about “being a pro,” and being able to run plays set for you, and how it “drained energy from people who are being pros.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Celtics people such as broadcaster Tommy Heinsohn and director of special projects and former all-star Jo Jo White say Rivers's experience as a player (13 years in NBA with four teams) has given him added insight into nurturing Garnett, 35, Paul Pierce, 34, and Ray Allen, 36, through the twilight years of their careers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cobbled-together nature inflicted on this season by the NBA lockout – Allen said: “There's no rhyme or reason to what we're used to” – has added another wrinkle to the old face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I didn't play during the last lockout, but I would say this: just having coached for a while, you kind of know your guys and understand legs,” Rivers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If I have a choice between their brains or legs, I'm going to choose their legs, you know? Because if you're tired – if we do practice and watch all the video in the world and their legs don't work – it's not going to matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So we've chosen the route we've gone. Less practices, less film work, less everything. I don't enjoy it, but I think it's the way you have to go right now.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Celtics came into Friday's game leading the NBA in lowest field-goal percentage against, lowest three-point percentage against and fewest points per game allowed. This, remember, is without 25-year-old Jeff Green, who was supposed to add an element of youth and athleticism but is out for the season with a heart condition. But it didn't matter Friday. The Raptors went wire-to-wire on the team that had allowed the third-fewest fast-break points in the league.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was close in the fourth, but with the Celtics in zone defence, Raptors head coach Dwane Casey unleashed Linas Kleiza and Leandro Barbosa. And when the Celtics started to roust themselves late, Casey put in Jose Calderon – who tortured Rondo all night. During timeouts, Casey kept reminding his team the Celtics were gassed, they had no shot-blockers, if they were a step or two behind they couldn't get set defensively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rivers's team arrived at its Toronto hotel at 3:30 a.m. local time Friday, but Rivers didn't give the players an out. If they're not mentally tough enough to handle that, he sniffed, they're not mentally tough enough to win.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing to do with age, that.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barack Obama surely has bad luck: a financial collapse, a recession and huge fiscal deficit bequeathed by the Bush administration, obdurate Republicans in Congress. But, each day, he must fall briefly to his knees in the Oval Office to thank his Maker for the state of today's Republican Party.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Yorker magazine cover had it right: The President is depicted ostensibly watching the Super Bowl and eating popcorn, but, instead of footballers, the helmeted players are Republican presidential hopefuls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What a meagre group they are. Polls show Mr. Obama beating them all, despite an approval rating hovering around 50 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The distinguishing characteristic of this Republican marathon, apart from the mediocrity of the choice, is that the party's various subgroups can't stand one or more of the candidates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only moderately sensible one is Mitt Romney, but the evangelicals, Tea Partiers, anti-Federal Reservists and all other extreme conservatives don't trust, like or support him. Despite Mr. Romney's kowtowing to their issues, he just can't win them over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the more Mr. Romney – who eventually will be the nominee – prostrates himself to their causes, the less electable he will be when it counts: in the November election. But the longer it takes for him to win the nomination, the more Americans will see of Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum and Ron Paul, the sight of whom in an ostensibly serious political party will cause sensible voters to wonder what happened to the Grand Old Party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What happened, as some conservative commentators are noting with despair, is that the party has been taken over by its extremes and its factions. The whole party intellectually surrendered to the false gods of supply-side economics some time ago. Despite the repeated and demonstrated failure of that theory, it remains the anchor of Republican economic thinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its political appeal is obvious: that ever-lower taxes will actually increase revenues, which, in turn, will make the country's bloated deficit disappear. And, by the way, less money for the state will eventually shrink the state, good news for those – à la Boston Bruins goalie Tim Thomas – who see the state as a threat to human liberty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone with a passing acquaintance with U.S. history understands the power of the appeal that less government is the best defence of liberty. They will also know that, in such a diverse country, with so many regional, religious and ethnic cleavages, social and political movements of all sorts have always sprouted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That evangelicals are so powerful today harkens back to the Pilgrims and the Quakers, the Great Revivals, William Jennings Bryan, spiritualists, Social Gospellers, Billy Graham, the Elmer Gantry types and all the television evangelists of past and present.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That Mr. Paul's supporters are isolationists to the core recalls Washington's “no foreign entanglements,” Charles Lindberg, William McCormick and other Midwestern isolationists of yester-year. That rank-and-file Republicans see conspiracies against their liberties evokes witch hunts from Salem to Joe McCarthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That Fox News roasts the President echoes Father Charles Coughlin's radio programs blasting Franklin D. Roosevelt. That the two parties are so divided on almost everything is nothing new, since, in the early decades of the new country, Federalists and Republicans fought over everything. Even such an idealized persona as Thomas Jefferson paid newspaper hacks to write scurrilous articles about his principal rival, John Adams. That race underpins voting patterns and social attitudes is nothing new at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of political cycles, as a general rule, the broad centrist mainstream carries the day, which is as it will be when all the attack ads have ceased, the last millions have been spent and the final votes have been counted. By then, the Santorums and Pauls and Gingriches will have joined Herman Cain, Rick Perry, Michele Bachmann and Donald Trump as figures whose marginality will have been so richly deserved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least, this is what America's friends abroad have to believe these days.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Canada, too, has had its senior moment. When Prime Minister Stephen Harper suggested that Canada would soon join most other Western countries in raising its pension age to 67, he triggered an angry round of debate. We were late entering this argument: Europeans have been having it for a decade.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it is only the beginning, because pensions represent only a tiny part of a much larger global problem. At its core are a set of non-problems: People around the world are living longer and having far fewer children – a consequence of increased female education rates and declining absolute poverty. Countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia and Iran are now having so few children that their populations are on the verge of shrinking – as would Canada's without immigrants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the consequence of smaller families is fewer young people. And family sizes have plummeted so fast, around the world, that working-age adults are being outnumbered by seniors and children, who tend to be dependent on state funds for their health, education and livelihoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world is on the threshold of what might be called “peak people.” The world's supply of working-age people will soon be shrinking, causing a shift from surplus to scarcity. As with “peak oil” theories – which hold that declining petroleum supplies will trigger global economic instability – the claims of the doomsayers are too hyperbolic and hysterical. These are not existential threats but policy challenges. That said, they're very big policy challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's crisis is mild compared to most countries, but it's still serious. There are currently almost five working-age Canadians whose income taxes pay the pension and health-care costs of each retiree; within 20 years, there will be only three. As a result, says Ottawa, health-care costs will double and social-service costs will rise by a third. Compared to, say, Japan, where pensioners will become a majority this century, that's nothing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But population aging will affect us in far more profound ways, because it is global.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 11 per cent of the world's people are over 60 at the moment. In the next 25 years that will double, to almost a fifth, and one in six of those people will be over 80, according to a forthcoming book, Global Aging in the 21st Century, by sociologists Susan McDaniel of the University of Lethbridge and Zachary Zimmer of the University of California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While this is affecting every country and region – even sub-Saharan Africa is now seeing a very fast rise in its proportion of seniors – some countries are being hit very hard. While 12 per cent of Chinese are now over 60, in two decades, there will be more than 28 per cent. Brazil faces a similar blow. It will be very difficult for countries that are only just emerging from poverty to suddenly face huge elder-care costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peak people will be an age when jobs compete for workers rather than vice versa. The cheapest labour will vanish. We're already seeing this: Because China is aging very fast, its dwindling working-age population is turning down the lowest-paid jobs and pushing up minimum wage sharply, as well as the once-minimal costs of social services: Stuff from China will stop being cheap, because the Chinese aren't young.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This can have larger consequences than we imagine. For example, the United States appeared to be escaping the worst of the aging trend because it has an unusually high fertility rate (averaging almost 2.1 children per family, half a child more than Canada and Europe). Most analysts assumed that this was the result of American religion or prosperity. But an important new study by economists Moshe Hazan and Hosny Zoabi has found that the real reason for larger families is the unusually large supply of low-cost babysitters and child-care workers in the U.S. – mainly due to immigration, much of it “illegal,” from Latin America. But those Central American countries and Mexico are themselves aging fast, which will soon choke off that cheap labour supply and drive up the cost of having extra kids – which will cause the U.S. to become less fertile and more elderly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peak people will also be an age when countries will be competing for immigrants rather than trying to limit them. Immigration has spared Canada from the worst of aging, but immigrants adopt host-country family sizes very quickly, so they're a temporary fix. And if their home countries are competing to keep them, then we'll have a harder time finding young people who want to come. It will require nimble and clever policies to prevent us from becoming old and lonely.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will put Ontario's dire fiscal situation into sharper focus. It will poke and provoke. It will even provide a few fresh ideas.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What economist Don Drummond's long-awaited report won't do, when it's finally released on Wednesday, is help Dalton McGuinty's government overcome its biggest obstacle to saving Canada's largest province from financial collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In about 400 government-commissioned recommendations, including more than 100 on health care alone, the economist will tell Mr. McGuinty's Liberals where they need to go on public-service reform. But contrary to popular belief, they already have a pretty good sense of that. What they don't know, and what Mr. Drummond mostly won't tell them, is how to get there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In conversations with those who have seen the full report, or at least large chunks of it, a word comes up repeatedly: “compendium.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a way of saying the report is basically a laundry list of reforms Mr. Drummond thinks government should consider. Some of those ideas are entirely original. But most, while not getting much public attention, have been floating around for years in government departments and sectors and research papers (including some written by Mr. Drummond himself).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Putting them all in one place is useful in forcing an overdue debate about the tough choices ahead. So, too, is framing them in the context of Mr. Drummond's grim economic forecast. While some will be rejected out of hand – there's no way Mr. McGuinty will abandon signature education policies of smaller class sizes and full-day kindergarten – others will gain legitimacy and momentum. And the exercise has compelled the Liberals to start publicly laying out their plans, including in a speech that Finance Minister Dwight Duncan will make two days before the report drops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where the report will fall short, in terms of the government's needs if not reasonable expectations, is in terms of implementation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the odd exception – aside from the flashier stuff, the education section seems to contain some unusually detailed proposals for how to reap savings from different staffing models – it's been described as largely “aspirational.” It will be specific in telling government what to strive for, without delving into the nitty-gritty of how to achieve it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For evidence that it's nitty-gritty that's missing, consider the “action plan” delivered in a recent speech by Health Minister Deb Matthews.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To her credit, Ms. Matthews promised to expand the mandate of controversial Local Health Integration Networks to include oversight of primary care – a move that risks a backlash, but one Liberals believe is necessary to make the system more efficient. But when pressed for details on how exactly the LHINs will interact with family doctors, and how they'll overcome the general toothlessness that has impeded regionalization to date, government officials hedged. They are looking at many different delivery models, and haven't settled on one yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much the same answer could have been given on any number of files, particularly with regard to health care. The Liberals know they want fewer procedures done in hospitals that could be done elsewhere, and fewer “bed blockers” in hospitals who could be at home, and a shift toward “evidence-based medicine,” all of which will be raised in Mr. Drumond's report. But they can't just snap their fingers and make it happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The barrier, as much as lack of will, is absence of infrastructure. There are very smart senior political staff and bureaucrats. But those familiar with the inner workings of government suggest there just aren't enough willing or able bodies to drive dozens of reforms at once, let alone 400 of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of this is Mr. Drummond's problem. Sources say his report includes a chapter on how the Premier's Office and Cabinet Office could be reorganized to drive change more efficiently. Otherwise, having had less than a year to study reforms, he could hardly have been expected to come up with a detailed road map for each one, nor is that the expertise he offered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that regard, the Liberals dropped the ball. Amid last year's focus on getting re-elected, little time seems to have been spent on a transition plan to turn promises into reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To listen to much of the hype, Ontario will never be the same after Wednesday. That may be true, in terms of public perceptions. But within government, the reality won't have changed much at all.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last weekend, faced with the prospect of five potentially rain-free days in February, with daytime temperatures hovering around the 8 C mark, I put my motorcycle back on the road for the season. I'm fully aware that doing this virtually guarantees 13 more weeks of rain, or sub-zero temperatures or both. I'm sorry. I couldn't help myself.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first ride of the year is always difficult. Getting used to the bike again requires shedding months of driving inside a climate-controlled, six-airbag metal cage with a radio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took about five minutes in traffic to remember what I had almost forgotten over the winter: In Vancouver, bad drivers aren't the exception – they're the rule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You feel this on a motorbike in a way you don't feel it in a car. It has to do with being exposed and acutely aware of everything going on around you as you move at the speed of traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What you learn in a hurry is that car drivers in Vancouver are an oblivious and self-involved lot who appear to pay little attention to the task at hand: piloting a couple of tonnes of steel and plastic through obstacles at a high rate of speed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coincidentally this week, the City of Vancouver unveiled its newest campaign to “raise awareness” about traffic safety. It's called “People are Fragile” and imagines us all as shiny porcelain figurines just waiting to be smashed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign targets pedestrians, cyclists and drivers equally: pedestrians for their propensity to jaywalk; cyclists because they tend to run stop signs; and drivers because they speed and tend to barrel through intersections with little regard for the aforementioned fragility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I can appreciate the city's efforts to make pedestrians more aware of the dangers around them. I also appreciate the effort (futile though it may be) to teach cyclists to stop for stop signs and obey the rules of the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's the behaviour of drivers that threatens everyone. Tailgating, failing to shoulder-check before changing lanes, failing to signal, speeding, running red lights, and ignoring “no-turn” signals are just a few of the common infractions. We've all followed drivers who do all of the above in the space of a few blocks. We've also followed the driver going 35 kilometres an hour in the left-hand lane causing those around them to behave erratically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And we've been beside the guy who thinks every red light is another opportunity for them to grab the holeshot and be first to the next red light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question I ask myself every time: Where is the enforcement?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Vancouver, when police decide to enforce traffic laws, it's a major event, generally accompanied by a news conference or a press release and confetti. We have “enforcement campaigns.” But I can't recall the last time I saw a driver pulled over spontaneously because he or she did something stupid or dangerous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And one year after the much-celebrated hand-held cellphone ban went into effect, seeing a driver beside you on the phone or texting is still a common occurrence. I know police say they're pulling people over and ticketing them for distracted driving. I've just never seen it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't need another awareness campaign. This is not a case of drivers being unaware of their responsibilities or the rules of the road. They are, after all, the only mode of transportation of the three that requires a test of skill and a licence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is about entitlement and selfishness and disregard for the safety of others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's new campaign urges pedestrians, cyclists and motorists to “practise courtesy” and “follow the rules of the road” because “the responsibility for safer streets belongs to everyone.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So yes, jaywalkers, please stop jaywalking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cyclists, stop at stop signs, don't ride the wrong way down one-way streets, and please stay off the sidewalks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Motorists, please stop driving like idiots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And police, please surprise me, and pull that guy over.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While I retracted my comments, the similarities between the two are very clear and you can't convince me of otherwise.” – Bruce-Grey-Owen Sound MP Larry Miller</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I imagine not, Mr. Miller, but I am still compelled to try.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The comments to which Mr. Miller refers are those he made during a debate on the gun registry in the House of Commons – remarks he then retracted after complaints from the opposition. Among other things Mr. Miller said of Canada's gun registry was: “That is what Adolf Hitler tried to do in the 1930s.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so (deep breath in) here begins the re-education (yes, I'm Mao) of Larry Miller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story that Adolf Hitler is the father of gun control is popular among those who oppose any sort of restrictions on firearms. This is the quote they often use: “This year will go down in history! For the first time, a civilized nation has full gun registration! Our streets will be safer, our police more efficient, and the world will follow our lead into the future!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year is usually given as 1935. The quote is sometimes said to be from Mein Kampf, or sometimes from one of Hitler's speeches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, there's no record of Hitler ever having said any such thing, and he changed Germany's gun-control laws (actually introduced in 1928 under the Weimar regime) very little.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, he did write this in Mein Kampf (published 1925-26): “Since in my free time I received singing lessons in the cloister at Lambach, I had excellent opportunity to intoxicate myself with the solemn splendour of the brilliant church festivals. As was only natural, the abbot seemed to me, as the village priest had once seemed to my father, the highest and most desirable ideal.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That quote isn't disputed. Which is why, unless you support a ban on singing, abbots or church festivals, it's facile and tasteless to invoke real or imagined Hitler quotes, or indeed actions, in aid of whatever unassociated cause you're pushing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, I don't know that the false Hitler gun-registration quote was the inspiration for Mr. Miller's warning. But the fact that he also claimed that retired senator Sharon Carstairs once said that registering hunting rifles is “the first step in the social re-engineering of Canadians” – something she denies, with no evidence to the contrary – suggests that he's a fan of manufactured quotes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Mr. Miller withdrew the retraction demanded by the House the next day – essentially saying, “I retract my statement, but I do want to point out what an awesome statement it was!” – I think he should be asked to expound on his theories and their source a little further. I, for one, am listening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it turns out that Mr. Miller's true concern about the Canadian gun registry stems from a fear that any regulations around the possession of weapons will ultimately pose a threat to the safety of Jews, and he manages to convince us in this matter (perhaps he has some secret knowledge of 1930s German arms-control law that has eluded scholars so far), then, yes, the rest of Canada ought to know.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, our government should really take this issue up with Israel, for example, at the soonest possible moment, because Israel is one of many countries with numerous restrictions and regulations regarding weapons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, perhaps Mr. Miller's concern is that, somewhere down the road, the gun registry will be used to facilitate the seizure of weapons belonging to some currently unpopular or mistrusted minority in order to persecute them. Then perhaps he could be persuaded to sponsor a bill ensuring that, say, gay people, Muslims and people who really don't think Portlandia is funny are exempted from these gun-registration rules. It might help him sleep at night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wouldn't want to accuse Mr. Miller of exploiting the deaths of millions of people in order to advance an entirely unrelated political agenda without giving him another chance to clarify his remarks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, I could dismiss his statement as just a few more gratuitous Nazi references in a sea of gratuitous Nazi references. But I like to believe that every MP is committed to ensuring that the tone of our national debate is always kept level with, at a bare minimum, that employed during a Usenet flame war concerning the relative virtues of Captains Kirk and Picard.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, once thought to be tilting this country in the direction of the United States, is viewed as distinctive and a model for other nations, especially in the English-speaking Commonwealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That finding, in a U.S. study to be published this June, is a tribute to the intricate balancing act that is the 1982 Charter of Rights and Freedoms. As Canada was founded on compromise and dialogue, so are those qualities woven into its rights charter. And so it offers a structure for working through the competing interests found in any sophisticated, multicultural nation – as in the case of a Muslim woman who wished to wear her face veil while testifying in a sexual-assault case. (The case is before the Supreme Court of Canada.) That kind of discussion has proved illuminating for courts in other lands.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The structure for balancing opposed interests is found in three key sections. Section 1 sets out that rights are not absolute; governments may limit them, as long as they have evidence to justify those limits. (The Canadian Charter was the world's first rights-protecting agreement with a broad limitations clause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Section 15, the equality-rights section, is open-ended, and new groups, such as gays and lesbians, have been brought under its umbrella by the Supreme Court. (Hence, gay marriage.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Section 33, the override or “notwithstanding clause,” says that when a court strikes down legislation, a government may go ahead anyway – though it has to renew that decision every five years. That has made for a delicate balancing act between judges and legislators. Judges need to spend their political capital wisely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's worth remembering the fears, not entirely unfounded, that judges would in effect sweep legislators aside and run the country. The Canadian model that seeks a balance or dialogue between judges and legislators has become the norm in many democracies, according to Sujit Choudhry, a Canadian who is the Cecelia Goetz Professor of Law at the NYU School of Law. Judges in Britain, where the European Convention on Human Rights has been imported into domestic law, cannot strike down laws, but they can review them and pronounce them incompatible with the convention – obliging legislators to reply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Is Canada a constitutional superpower?” U.S. law professors David Law and Mila Versteeg ask, in an article to be published this June in the New York University Law Review. They imply the answer is . . . no. Still, “on average, the world's democracies are constitutionally more similar to Canada than to the United States.” And “given Canada's relatively high prestige and goodwill as a member of the international community,” they conclude that Canada is “a constitutional trend-setter among common-law countries.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is no military superpower, though it fights hard. It may yet become an energy superpower, whatever that is. But in projecting its values through the plain-language Charter of Rights and Freedoms, it is proving surprisingly influential: a moral leader.</p>

I hate parties. I'd forced myself to go to this one because I hadn't had a date in months. It had finally dawned on me that I was going to have to get out there and market myself. I spotted a man around my age across a crowded room, and asked someone if he was single. He was (more or less). I didn't think he was my type, but I made myself go talk to him anyway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We had a pleasant chat, but no sparks flew. It never occurred to either of us that we had met The One. I pretended to be lively and vivacious. He pretended to be charmed. I didn't know it at the time, but he was newly unmarried and interested in going out with as many women as possible. He asked for my phone number. Then he didn't call me for weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble with being a single woman over 30 is that the law of supply and demand has tilted irreversibly against you, and it's only going to get worse. This is grotesquely unfair, but there's no sense squawking about it. You're just going to have to work harder. Because I clung to my belief in the romantic coup de foudre, it took a long time for me to come to terms with this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truth is that if you're looking for a husband in your 30s, romance shouldn't be your first consideration. That can come later. Also, brutal realism is essential. Do not overestimate your charm. Do not expect men to flock to you the way they did when you were 21. Try to see yourself as they do. This may be disconcerting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I met you that night, I thought you were lively and outgoing,” my husband says. “Then I found out you were really a nerdy introvert with cats.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, our relationship barely survived the first date. We went to the movies. I picked a nature movie that featured graphic footage of wild animals tearing each other apart and having sex. He couldn't decide if I was weirdly interesting, or just weird.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We were never nuts about each other. But we got along. The good thing about going out with men who aren't your type is that you may be pleasantly surprised. You might even realize that the kind of men you always thought were your type are a complete disaster. I can't tell you how many girlfriends of mine have wasted the best years of their lives on men they imagined were their type, foolishly believing that these men would eventually (a) leave their wives, (b) sober up or (c) conquer their writers' block and sell their novel/screenplay. All these women were highly intelligent. But they were emotionally stupid. They allowed themselves to fall into the grip of some obsessive romantic fantasy that doomed them to unhappiness. If only their type had included men who were (a) available, (b) not addicted and (c) functional members of society.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that I did much better. Before I met my husband, I had a series of relationships with broody, complicated types. Some of them lived on different continents. Some were jealous of my career. Some asked why I was getting fat. If you are ever involved with somebody who asks why you're getting fat, I'm telling you to run, not walk, away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My future husband never seemed to mind if I happened to put on a few pounds. He liked me just the way I was. He was proud of my career. Eventually we moved in together to save money, and to see if we would get along. When the cat peed in his shoes, he didn't get upset. He didn't have a complicated side. For years, I thought this meant he must lack depth. But gradually, I realized it was among his finest qualities. One day, in a picturesque medieval town in France, he took me out for a fantastic meal, then fell down on one knee and proposed. I said I'd have to think about it. What an idiot!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We eventually did get married – 11 years after we met. Of course, I know now that he's just my type after all. True love isn't lightning bolts. It isn't something that just happens to you. It's something that you build together, over time. True love isn't what I used to think it was at all. It's infinitely better.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The public library is a city's epic living room – that's why the French neoclassical architect Étienne-Louis Boullée designed his utopian library as a monumental, barrel-vaulted hall big enough to hold the memory of the entire world. That's why the New York Public Library is a source of enlightenment and architectural pilgrimage. And it's why every year 19 million people flood into Toronto's libraries, many of them exhilarating, award-winning structures. Now, under constant fire from cities desperate to save money, libraries are figuring out how to get the message across that they are crucial to a vibrant civic life.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Free Library of Philadelphia is focusing hard on the economic case. After $12-million (U.S.) was cut recently from its budget, the institution fought back with a compelling economic analysis. Its business plan targeted fresh ways to assist job hunters, education for small business entrepreneurs, orientation for newly arrived immigrants, the appetites of digital geeks and classes for pre-kindergarten kids. The University of Pennsylvania's Fels Institute of Government created an economic impact report quantifying the value of the city's vast library system in dollars and cents. What it discovered was that homes located within one-quarter mile of the library were worth more than those further away. And that the library had contributed through its training programs and sourcing of jobs an estimated $30-million in earned income in one year. To cost-cutting politicians, those are the kinds of arguments that matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a key similarity between Philadelphia and Toronto: Both cities have seen an increase in police budgets while delivering punishing blows to libraries. Put more boots on the street to manage increasingly disenfranchised populations – the logic seems crazy but it's real. “Nearly 50 per cent of working-age Philadelphians are functionally illiterate,” said Siobhan A. Reardon, president and director of the Free Library in a lecture at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs. Though it operates as a municipal agency of the city of Philadelphia, the Free Library's 40-member private board is planning to step up its fundraising efforts to cover recent budget cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Free Library has used hard business-case facts, there are also libraries that have fought back with exhilarating, high-design environments. Desperate to re-engage a disenfranchised, illiterate community, politicians in southeast London turned to British pop-architect Will Alsop to produce the Peckham Library as one way to compete – somewhat – with hooliganism at soccer games and nightly binges at the pub. The copper-clad library raised up on cock-eyed stilts, much like the Alsop-designed Sharp Centre for Design at Toronto's Ontario College of Art &amp; Design, won the Civic Trust Award in 2003 for excellence in public architecture. In a city that enjoys wealthy patronage as well as the harsh reality of inner-city crack alleys, the $170-million Seattle Public Library was designed as a piece of contorted urban spectacle by Dutch cerebral starchitect Rem Koolhaas. On a Sunday afternoon a few years ago, the ground-floor atrium was pleasantly peopled, though not with the crush of people that regularly flows through the sumptuous, wood-lined Grande Bibliothèque in Montreal by the Patkau Architects of Vancouver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of its critical role as a receptacle of collective memory and consciousness, the public library has always attracted among the most talented architects and even geniuses of art and design. In a cloister in Florence, Michelangelo designed Italy's first public library, the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana (1534), with theatrical, almost surreal flourishes such as overscaled stairs that cascade from the reading room into a grey stone entrance vestibule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One afternoon this week, walking through the white, light-filled Bloor-Gladstone Library in Toronto's west end, reimagined in 2009 so that a contemporary glass jewel dialogues with a historic Beaux-Arts library, I was struck by the young, fit-looking urban dwellers focused intensely on a book, or working through some chemistry problems while others studied computer screens. Every lounge chair was taken. Every wooden work counter set below each of the gracefully arched windows had been claimed by pairs of people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the city, where some 40,000 newly arrived Muslims from countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan and India live in high-rise towers, the new Thorncliffe Park Public Library is crammed with children who march from their elementary school – at more than 2,000 students, considered to be the largest one in North America – and into the naturally lit, joyous space. There's an interactive early literacy centre for parents and children under 5 at work here, and the computer stations are crammed with teens and adults who are without Internet at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More and more, true, unfettered public space is increasingly hard to come by. And no, Coffee Time and <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> do not count. In a world obsessed by connection, via Twitter, e-mail and endlessly multiplying <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> friends, the library gives us permission to hunker down by a window or a fireplace, disconnect from the hammering distractions of everyday life, and get on with what has to be learned, and contemplated.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A desperate father. A wayward daughter. A drug-dealing boyfriend. And tragedy on St. Patrick's Day.” That's how Lloyd Robertson introduces an in-depth look at a murder. In June 2011, Kim Walker was found guilty of manslaughter for the shooting death of James Hayward in Yorkton, Sask. Walker's daughter, Jadah, who was 16 years old at the time, and had moved in with Hayward, her 24-year-old boyfriend, a man the RCMP said was a major drug dealer in area. As Robertson tells the story it is a tale of teenagers feeling confined and rebellious in a small town, turning to drugs and events spiralling out of control. It's the details that are telling here – anonymous letters from concerned neighbours telling Jadah's parents of her drug use. Parents going to the police for help and feeling angry when instant action doesn't follow. All the ingredients were there for horror erupting in a teenage wasteland.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">of a Little Town</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunday, CBC, 8 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This wry, lovely-looking adaptation of some stories from Leacock's masterpiece manages the delicate task of finding hard truths in the author's sunny world. A touch of the real Leacock story – the unreliable father – is woven into events and what transpires as daydreaming in the stories is dramatized here. We get two of the core tales – the sinking of the Mariposa Belle steamboat, and events surrounding an attempt to stop the cancelling of the liquor licence of the Mariposa hotel. As adapted by Malcolm MacRury, the production has a sometimes surreal quality, one that saves it from lapsing into merely pretty, affectionate, period-piece drama for TV. Here the comedy touches on both the pleasures and terrible limitations of small-town life. Gordon Pinsent narrates as Leacock's voice, and the large cast includes Jill Hennessy, Peter Keleghan, Colin Mochrie, Caroline Rhea, Patrick McKenna, Leah Pinsent, Sean Cullen and Ron James. American Donal Logue is excellent as Josh Smith, the hotelier and rogue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 54th Annual</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunday, CBS, Global, 8 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If I understand this correctly, Adele will sweep all the main Grammy award categories. Thus, the main fun is with the performances – Nicki Minaj (not sure who that is, I admit), Bruno Mars, Foo Fighters, Paul McCartney, Jason Aldean, Kelly Clarkson and Taylor Swift are scheduled to do their thing. And Coldplay will team up with Rihanna, which should either be intriguing or off-putting, depending on your musical taste. The host is LL Cool J, which is mystifying, I think. He's way past his prime isn't he? Late-breaking is news that the Beach Boys will perform, the first time the founding members have played together in public in two decades – that is, Brian Wilson, Mike Love and Al Jardine, with David Marks and Bruce Johnston. They're doing something with Maroon 5 and Foster the People. Fogeys, take note.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, it's back, in what is grandly being called “the midseason premiere.” That really means there are new episodes airing tonight and for the next few weeks. If you so choose, you can catch up. AMC is airing a Walking Dead marathon, with Season 1 starting on Saturday, at 8 p.m. And Season 2 airing Sunday, starting at 1:30 p.m. When last we met the motley crew trying to survive in a world of flesh-eating zombies, some terrible things happened. It is only necessary to remember the scene of the character Sophia coming out of the barn at the farm where the crew had landed and stayed, to be reminded of the powerful emotions that The Walking Dead can evoke. There is always heartbreak and terror. Main character Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) is still the cop, still trying to be a true leader. The zombies are still dangerous, but the message remains – humanity is doomed unless people learn to get along.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three-month-old Skander-Jack, son of NDP MP Sana Hassainia, had to leave the House of Commons this week, despite the fact that he seemed to be both quieter and better behaved than many elected members. There was, it seems, a bit of commotion because MPs wanted to take pictures of the adorable baby. (This is completely understandable: Skander-Jack knows how to rock an orange onesie, and I'd be wearing one myself if it didn't make me look like an escapee from a maximum-security prison.)</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason Ms. Hassainia left the House with her baby became shrouded in confusion – it seems the issue was the MPs taking photographs, not the baby himself. Still, it was unclear to Ms. Hassainia whether the child was welcome in the House. One thing is clear: A mother and MP, trying to serve her constituents, was left juggling childcare and work. It's a dilemma millions of parents face every day, although with fewer cameras to record the struggle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We don't want privileges, we want to be able to work and take care of our families,” Ms. Hassainia told reporters, and Green Party Leader Elizabeth May noted that, “If we're going to fully integrate women in the House of Commons, that includes babies. If you're going to be a working mom, then you need to have the institutions prepared to accommodate.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Absolutely, except it's not just the women in Parliament who need to be accommodated, but all working mothers across the country. It's almost six years since the Conservative government decided that a national childcare policy should be shunned in favour of $100-a-month allowance to families with young children. It's just about a year since Diane Finley, the Human Resources Minister, revealed the government's contempt for daycare: “It's the Liberals who wanted to ensure that parents are forced to have other people raise their children.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Try to dispel the image of children as tiny veal calves shoved into pens by callous farmhands, if you can, and instead consider that in many parts of the world it's perfectly acceptable, even favourable, to have other people raise your children. That is, if the government has invested in a system where child-care workers are valued, where children's well-being is valued, and – this is crucial – women's ability to work without bankrupting themselves or losing their sanity is also valued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take France, for example. The most interesting part of the new parenting memoir Bringing Up Bébé: One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting is not, in fact, about little Guillaume's perfect table manners, but about the state system of subsidized child-care that allows Guillaume's mom to leave him at his nursery without worry. “French mothers go back to work, in part, because they can,” writes Pamela Druckerman, the American in Paris who wrote the book. “The high-quality crèches, subsidized shared nannies and child-minders all make the transition logistically possible.” It is not a perfect system, but it works because everyone buys into it. There is no stigma, Ms. Druckerman adds, to having someone else raise your children, if it's the right someone else. The women who chose to go back to work aren't bathed in guilt or swimming in debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parisians fight to get their children into daycare. In London, where I live, there's a network of state-subsidized nurseries that are entirely free from the age of 3, but it's easier for a rich man to pass into the kingdom of heaven than for Imogen or Archie to walk through the gates of the free nursery. My children were lucky enough to get into one, which meant I could go back to work without selling the family silver (or, in my case, the family zinc.) My neighbour, a busy doctor, spent a day measuring the distance to the nursery with a yardstick trying to prove to the council that his children were in the catchment zone. The council didn't buy it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freeing women for work makes economic sense: Britain's Institute for Public Policy Research calculated that millions of pounds in tax revenues would be raised every year if the government invested in a system of free child care, enough to offset the outlay. The prohibitively high cost of daycare is a main reason for Britain's low rate of female employment. But universal daycare is a long-term, costly and – as we've seen in Canada – politically divisive issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It sometimes feels that we've been chewing over this problem since Sir John A. was a pup. Still Canadian parents are caught in a web of daycare waiting lists, last-minute calls to grandpa – or taking the baby into the House of Commons because you can't find your husband to do the handoff at the last minute. Maybe things will be better by the time Skander-Jack's old enough to vote.</p>

He found that (wait for it) people riding the subway want more subways. “The proof is in the pudding,” crowed the mayor to CP24 broadcaster Stephen LeDrew. “Every single person said, ‘I want underground transit.'”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, of course they do. Everyone agrees that subways are a superior form of public transit. They're faster. They carry more people. They don't muck up traffic on the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm a subway nut myself. I've explored subways from Stockholm to Seoul to Mexico City. I keep a book called Transit Maps of the World on my coffee table. I think Toronto's failure to build its rapid transit network is the city's biggest failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But let's be realistic. There simply isn't enough money on the table for the ambitious subway build-out that Mr. Ford is promising. I wish desperately that there were, but we have to live in the world as it is. The provincial government is strapped. So is Ottawa. Both are in the midst of wrenching cutbacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ford, of all people, should understand that. It is a delicious irony to see a mayor who insists that governments must live within their means telling deficit-ridden higher governments to cough up for his subway fantasies. To pretend that they are going to shower Toronto with billions for subways is to perpetrate a hoax on weary commuters. Yet that is just what the mayor is doing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When council threw out a vastly expensive plan to run most of the Eglinton-Scarborough Crosstown line underground, he said he was “very confident” that Premier Dalton McGuinty would proceed with the underground plan regardless. Mr. McGuinty flatly contradicted him. He says he talked with Mr. Ford last week and told him the province would have no choice but to consider council's decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Mr. Ford persists. “The Premier will do what's right, and that's build subways.” If he doesn't, he says, dropping a standard Fordian threat, “he's going to have to face the voters.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ford is equally upbeat about getting federal cash. A budget is coming down soon, he notes, and he is again “very confident” there will be more money for subways. “Once people told them loud and clear they want subways, like they have, I'm sure they will fund it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where he gets that confidence is unclear. The feds have so far promised just $333-million for Toronto transit and even that has not been nailed down. As for the province, it has said over and over that its transit commitment stands at $8.4-billion, not a penny more. So when the mayor says he wants to build all-underground rapid transit not just on Eglinton but on Sheppard and Finch, he is living in subway dreamland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His brother, Etobicoke councillor Doug Ford, told CP24's Mr. LeDrew that the mayor has a “solid plan” for Sheppard, laid out in a report by former city councillor Gordon Chong. He has nothing of the sort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even Dr. Chong, a subway enthusiast, concedes that his report is only a preliminary look at what kind of financing tools the city could use to raise the billions needed to extend the Sheppard “stubway” to Scarborough city centre. Many of those tools, like road tolls, are things that Mr. Ford abhors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for a subway on Finch, that is so far little more than a notion, with no money committed by other levels of government and no hint of how Toronto would pay for it on its own. To dangle it in front of the poor souls who ride the packed Finch bus is downright mean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ford is right: People want subways. What they don't want, surely, is empty promises about subway projects in the sky.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One night this week in London, on the creaky upper floor of The Coach and Horses, Soho's most notorious literary pub, a golden hatchet was plunged into a book. Technically, it was a cake baked into the shape of a book; and the hatchet was spray-painted. But the crowd – affably rowdy on free-flowing Cava and crab canapés – still roared its approval.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was, after all, a party to celebrate the trashing of books. Or as one of the organizers from the literary journal Omnivore put it, “This is for all the people who respect the author and the book enough to say what they really think. It's for people who've resisted the urge to backscratch and simper in pursuit of literary glory!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was referring to the Hatchet Job of the Year Award – London's newest and most novel literary prize, an accolade honouring “the angriest, funniest, most trenchant book review of the past 12 months.” The aim, according the prize's manifesto, is to promote candour and wit in literary journalism and to raise the profile of that most beleaguered of modern-media professions: the book critic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inaugural winner was the novelist Adam Mars-Jones, who was singled out for his merciless review of Michael Cunningham's By Nightfall in The Observer. In it, Mars-Jones takes issue with Cunningham's predilection for literary allusion, remarking that references are “all well and good – but Gatsby didn't get to be Gatsby by dangling dozens of previous books behind it, like tin cans tied to a tricycle.” His last line is delivered with particularly ruthless acuity. “That's not an epiphany,” he says of one of Cunningham's preciously crafted images, “that's a postcard.” Ouch!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a party celebrating negativity, the mood was surprisingly upbeat. One of the judges, columnist and author Sam Leith, read out the best lines from all the nominees. These included Geoff Dyer's New York Times review of Julian Barnes's Man Booker-winning novel The Sense of an Ending (“excellent in its averageness”); Leo Robson on Richard Bradford's bio of Martin Amis (“spectacularly bad writing – about spectacularly good writing”); and a Sunday Times review by the columnist Camilla Long describing Monique Roffey's With the Kisses of His Mouth, a memoir of midlife sexual rebirth, as “a pointlessly explicit, infuriatingly naive and, at times, plain off-putting slither through a series of – wilfully? maliciously? – unedited sexual slurpings.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another judge, the novelist and journalist Rachel Johnson (sister to London's shambolic Mayor Boris), peered out from under her sheepdog bangs and declared, “We're not here to punish bad writing but to reward really good reviews.” By good of course, she meant bad, but bad in a deliciously good way. The sharp-tongued grammarian Lynn Barber presented Mars-Jones with his prize (a certificate for a year's supply of potted shrimp), but not before urging all writers and editors present to “fight against the tide of hype and publicity,” by “reading the book, and if it's crap, saying it's crap.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone in the room, however, was thrilled by the notion that critics should be more widely encouraged to plunge the knife in and twist. One well-known London literary agent confided to me, off the record, that the real problem with our sagging critical culture on both sides of the Atlantic is the fact that book critics at serious newspapers are being given less space and compensation for their efforts. According to a survey by the trade journal The Bookseller, only 15 per cent of readers choose books based on a periodical's review, preferring recommendations from Amazon and social-networking sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, as the folks at Omnivore point out in their press release, a single tweet by Stephen Fry will have far greater impact on a book's sales than a dozen broadsheet reviews. As for the argument that nasty criticism stirs healthy debate, the agent was not so sure. “As Brits, I'm not so sure we need encouragement in that regard,” she sniffed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proponents of the prize deny that it's driven by schadenfreude – though Gore Vidal's observation, “Every time a friend succeeds, I die a little,” might well account for the lively spirits in the room – finally, a literary prize that celebrates the failings of others; now, that we can get behind!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was, however, no irony in Mars-Jones's thrilled acceptance of his prize. With a hatchet in one hand and a hunk of decimated book cake in the other, Mars-Jones did not bother to conceal his delight at being declared literary meanie of the year. “It's especially nice because it's the first award,” he told me with a laugh. “That way, no one can I say I just wrote something nasty in order to get all the potted shrimp.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Attention City Hall: If you're going to tease voters with promises of a “Transit Showdown,” then here's a thought – have an actual Transit Showdown. Here's another idea: Sell tickets. I suggest the following:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City Hall – Council Chamber. A gong is struck. Toronto's left-leaning councillors file into the chamber, one by one.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Councillor Joe Mihevc sports a beret and revolutionary beard reminiscent of Che. He is followed by Councillor Shelley Carroll, who waves a placard that says, “Tax the Rich (and by rich, I mean middle class),” followed by Councillor Mike Layton, whose T-shirt reads, “I've been struck by CUPE's bow.” Up in the viewing gallery, David Miller gorges on fair-trade popcorn with Fidel Castro, Hugo Chavez and the ghost of Joseph Stalin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Loony Left take their seats. As the lights dim, a talentless, government-funded modern-dance troupe takes the stage. Dancers in black leotards impersonate cars. They accelerate, honk and screech to halts as children choke on fumes and cyclists are cut off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid the pandemonium, three dancers form an LRT, which cruises calmly through the angry traffic. The other cars look on with anger and envy. But lo! They recognize the foolishness of their ways and join their communal-minded brethren, forming one giant LRT. There is much rejoicing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the lights come up, the left-leaning councillors cheer and shower the dancers with money, which they charge as office expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Councillor Adam Vaughan, dressed as a Buddhist monk (or perhaps a Sith lord), rises and says, “It is time.” The left-leaning councillors raise their hands in solidarity, voting to resurrect Transit City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As counting nears completion, a tremendous rumbling is felt. Chandeliers sway! Dust falls from the ceiling! A great pit opens in the middle of the council chamber, revealing a vast and expensive subterranean tunnel. The sharp whine of engines is heard and a motorcycle gang, led by Doug Ford and clad in black leather and helmets with spikes on top, zooms out of the tunnel. They circle the Loony Left, revving their engines and sending patches of fire-retardant carpet flying. The Loony Left cower in terror, weeping as they cover their ears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More rumbling. A subway bursts from the tunnel, ridden rodeo-style by Mayor Rob Ford, who waves a cowboy hat above his head and shouts, “Chugga-chugga choo-choo!” More hands rise. City council's Radical Right holds its own transit vote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vote is even! Council is deadlocked. What will happen?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High up, above the din of partisan squabble, the tie-breaking vote appears. Councillor Karen Stintz, suspended by an invisible wire, descends from the rafters. The Ford brothers high-five. The Looney Left turn their tear-stained faces to look for David Miller, but he is on a Porter flight to New York. Transit City is surely dead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Councillor Stintz's feet touch down, she walks over and joins the Radical Right. But instead of raising her hand, as everyone expects, she dumps a bucket of diverted downspout water on Mayor Ford's head, then dashes over to the Loony Left. Her raised arm joins theirs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Transit City! Transit City!” they shout, amid the mayor's shrieks of “I'm melting…” Ms. Stintz and her new friends join hands and sing Kumbaya. When at last the song finishes, Mayor Ford has disappeared. All that is left is a rumpled suit lying in a pool of … gravy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a trend that's been (um) growing, getting (ahem) harder and harder to overlook, so I guess I'll have to (blush) stiffen my resolve and, yes, plunge in: The preponderance of straight men making penis jokes in the movies and on TV has become a (sorry, can't resist) full-blown epidemic. Unfortunately, the above sentence is about as sophisticated as things get. The bromances popularized by Judd Apatow and his ilk are expanding – verbally, anyway – into full-frontal crassness. Call it bronography.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone who has seen a movie by Apatow (Knocked Up), the Farrelly brothers (Hall Pass, There's Something about Mary) and their ilk, watched the documentary The Aristocrats, or gone to a comedy club in the last half-century, knows that dick jokes are nothing new. Comedies are written by comedians, and comedians are obsessed with their genitalia. Apatow himself once vowed to include a penis in every one of his films.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I'm talking about something more than movies like The Hangover Part 2, Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Borat, which use naked flapping penises as set-ups and punchlines. More than Justin Timberlake and Andy Samberg's instant classic, Dick in a Box, their mock video for Saturday Night Live. More than the dialogue in films like Superbad, where Michael Cera razzes Jonah Hill about performing oral sex on his dad, or Clerks II, where a drug dealer says he's holding “everything but coke, heroin and your cock.” I'm talking about a dick-mance of a kind I've never seen before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the upcoming hockey comedy Goon, Seann William Scott plays a sweet but dim-witted soul who finds salvation in becoming an enforcer for a B-league team, and Jay Baruchel plays his best buddy. Throughout the film, Baruchel spouts a non-stop, high-octane stream of penis jokes, including an offer to cheer up his pal by – I'm paraphrasing here – inserting his member into Scott's backside and “filling him up with cream.” I was startled, but Scott didn't even look surprised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less frank but still notable is the upcoming action/romance This Means War, in which two studly CIA operatives (Chris Pine and Tom Hardy) employ their covert skills and tactics to cock-block one another as they compete for Reese Witherspoon. It quickly becomes apparent, though, that the only relationship that matters is the one between the two men – and that they have at least a passing familiarity with one another's equipment. After bugging Reese's home, they hear her complain to her best pal (Chelsea Handler – more on her in a bit) about the smallness of Pine's hands. We all know what that means. But the old joke takes a new bent when Pine turns to Hardy and pleads, “You've seen it. Tell her it's not small.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You've seen it” … really? That's not a line Bob Hope would have said to Bing Crosby, no matter how many roads they went down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend really crystallized for me at last month's Golden Globe Awards. The evening was, yes, crammed with penis jokes. Ricky Gervais claimed to have a small one. Seth Rogen announced he had “a massive erection” from standing near his co-presenter, Kate Beckinsale. Tina Fey and Jane Lynch riffed about Hung star Thomas Jane's package, then high-fived and crowed “Penis joke!” In an act of equal-opportunity razzing, Gervais also made a vagina joke, saying that few men in the room had seen Jodie Foster's Beaver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it was when George Clooney joined in, comparing Michael Fassbender's member to a golf club – actually acting out its swing – that the trend became officially alarming. George Clooney, King of Hollywood, the New Jack, giving a shout-out to a fellow actor's statuette – well, blow me down, as it were.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm sure we could all speculate endlessly on why this is happening. Access to Internet pornography has created a world of sexters for whom nothing is off limits. The uncertainty of the job market, which has kept young adults from reaching economic maturity, has also kept them arrested in the genital stage of development. The record-breaking numbers of young men in U.S. prisons, as Adam Gopnik noted in a recent New Yorker, has contributed to making anal-sex jokes de rigueur. The current generation of twentysomethings, raised with less homophobia, is embracing Kinsey's theory that all sexuality is on a continuum. Take your pick – but prepare yourselves for more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As many have noted, it's not only men making genital jokes. In Bridesmaids – I should say, the Oscar-nominated Bridesmaids – Kristen Wiig bends herself over a table and closes one eye to approximate a scary penis, Maya Rudolph mimes a blow job and Melissa McCarthy refers to her “steaming undercarriage.” Handler and Witherspoon crack nasty all through This Means War. The wives in Hall Pass are more potty-minded than their husbands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this season on network TV, it's a foul-mouthed free-for-all – all genital jokes, all the time, with v-bombs added to the arsenal. Here the excuse is that network TV has to compete with the anything-goes nature of cable, and so far, the words “vagina” and “penis” haven't been banned by the censors. Just a few examples: On 2 Broke Girls, co-created by the comedian Whitney Cummings, when a customer snaps his fingers at a waitress (Kat Dennings), she snaps back, “This is the sound that dries up my vagina.” When her sleep-deprived roommate says she needs a good nine hours, Dennings retorts, “What you need is a good nine inches.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Characters on Are You There, Chelsea – based on Chelsea Handler's ultra-frank memoirs – talk about “lady wood,” “mouth STDs,” pooping during childbirth and a 15-year-old's “little boner.” In one scene, the title character, played by Laura Prepon, wants to ensure that a male colleague hears her, so she says she'll “talk to his boss.” Then she leans over and talks to his crotch. When he replies, “I'm not sure he heard. You might want to slap him around a little,” she tosses back, “I'm sure you beat him enough.” Cummings, on her own sitcom, Whitney, talks about bedazzling her vagina (“vajazzling”). And on Last Man Standing, Tim Allen recently strode into a sports shop and announced, “Smells like balls in here!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chuck Lorre, the creator of the double-entendre-rich series Two and a Half Men and Mike &amp; Molly, has summed up the climate: “One of the great things about broadcast TV is nobody really knows what's appropriate any more. It's a floating target.” So it's no surprise that HBO has a new, explicit comedy about twentysomething women, Girls, coming in April, whose co-creator, Lena Dunham, has been quoted as saying, “I plan to say ‘vagina' all the time.” And over on ABC, a new sitcom, Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23, also due in April, features this charming scene: A neighbour who spies on the female roommates can be seen masturbating in his kitchen window.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The true shame here is that instead of using this new freedom to make a deeper comment on human relations, these jokes simply sit there and snigger at their own naughtiness. It's a way to seem subversive without actually being subversive. (For an example of someone actually taking a joke somewhere, check out Wanda Sykes's Detachable Puss routine on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>.) I'm all in favour of a jaw-dropping joke, as long as it means something. But the rawness and lack of sophistication of most of this humour is literally at the level of a toddler: It reminds me of the time my two-year-old daughter chose the occasion of her christening to dash around the party and say to each relative in turn, “You have a penis! You have a vagina!” Some of them were amused, some less so. If only I'd known, I would have consoled them with the thought that that level of humour would be all she'd need in 2012 to make a killing writing comedy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Chicago lawyer named Paul Harris organized the world's first Rotary Club – “service above self” – in 1905. He was looking for a way to preserve, in a big hustling 20th-century metropolis, a sense of small-town 19th-century goodwill as he remembered it from his 1870s childhood in Vermont. It seems now, in retrospect, that he found it. With 34,000 clubs worldwide, Rotary is a global get-together with 1.2 million members – and a mission to eradicate polio from the face of the Earth.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remarkably, Rotary has essentially succeeded in doing so. When Rotary International took on the task of wiping out this highly infectious, crippling disease in the 1980s, more than 350,000 people, most of them children, were infected every year. Only 650 people were infected last year – and all of them lived in four countries (Afghanistan, Nigeria, Pakistan and India).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Rotarians didn't do it alone. The World Health Organization embraced the Rotarian goal in 1988. Along with other countries, Canada signed on as partners. So did the Melinda and Bill Gates Foundation. But it was the Rotarians who dreamed the dream, who raised more than $1-billion for vaccinations and who persevered for 30 years, as Prime Minister Stephen Harper nicely put it at the Commonwealth conference in Australia in October, “one child, one vaccination, one small dose – at 13 cents a dose – at a time.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the financially exhausted welfare state begins its slow and inexorable disintegration, Rotarians provide a timely reminder that government is not necessarily the only way, or necessarily the best way, to get important things done. In fact, government is sometimes the worst way to get important things done – by upsizing problems (and, hence, bureaucratizing them) rather than by downsizing them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the United States, the infamous food stamp program is a good example. (Originally established as a way to get rid of surplus agricultural production, it now feeds 44 million Americans – one person in seven.) In Canada, the isolated northern native reserves are a good example. (The more money the federal government pumps into these reserves, the more lethal they appear to become.) Could the Rotary Club not do better? Could the Shriners – with the 22 free-service children's hospitals they operate across North America – not do better?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simply put, isn't it time to restore heroic endeavour to charitable enterprise?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These questions are relevant at the moment. Chaired by Conservative MP James Rajotte, the House of Commons finance committee begins its review of Canadian charitable giving during this parliamentary session. All indications are that the committee will think small – tinkering with tax credits, for example, to encourage people to “stretch” their charitable donations. But this minimalist view of charity is inadequate – in principle and in execution. First, it requires the government to surrender revenue (through more generous tax credits) without any lessening of federal spending. Second, it perpetuates the notion that charitable endeavour should be limited to people's loose change and small tasks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The important task is not to induce an individual to give an extra $25 a year to charity; it is to get government itself to give – to delegate specific difficult jobs to ambitious non-governmental organizations and to donate significant amounts of money to fund them. Why go to the government? Because, as bank robber Willie Sutton famously said, that's where the money is. And further: Private charity will almost always do more with it than the government will do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis</span> has calculated the difference. “Charitable activities can be accomplished in the private sector,” the bank determined, “at about one-third less than what the government would have to spend to accomplish the same goals.” By this measure, government could devolve heroic assignments (subject to parliamentary oversight) to charitable organizations, save money – and produce greater results. For every $3-million donated, it could save $1-million; by requiring that the charity raise matching funds, a reasonable precaution, it could save $2-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009-2010, the federal government committed a supplementary $400-million in its Economic Action Plan to provide better housing on 200 first nations reserves. Could the Kiwanis Club or the Lions Club have done a better job? Amongst all the “service clubs,” who could do worse?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No surrender</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so many teams on playoff bubble and three points at stake each game, no one wants to throw in towel and make players available for trading</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What the heck, let's blame Gary Bettman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, the three-point system contributing most to the current trade-deadline inertia arrived under the NHL commissioner's watch. As the Feb. 27 trade deadline approaches, there are still far too many teams that think they're still in position to make a playoff run to create the annual player auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Eastern Conference, there were either eight teams in the hunt for the last two playoff spots or nine chasing three before the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s games Sunday, depending how you look at the race. Similarly, there were seven teams in the Western Conference chasing the last three spots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the logjam are the struggles of some of the teams trying to hold on to the last couple of playoff spots. In the East, the Ottawa Senators are 2-6-2 in their past 10 games and the Toronto Maple Leafs have to take a three-game losing string into a crucial road trip to Western Canada this week. On the West side, the sixth-place Chicago Blackhawks have a five-alarm fire going thanks to an eight-game losing skid that has head coach Joel Quenneville on the hot seat. The fifth-place <span class="companylink">Nashville Predators</span> and the seventh-place Los Angeles Kings are also struggling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With that many teams in position to relinquish their spots in the top eight, those below them are reluctant to abandon the race and create a pool of players for the trade deadline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble is, the three-point system's double whammy makes this situation hard to unlock. On the one hand, the one point for losing in overtime or a shootout makes it almost impossible for teams that fall way behind to make a dramatic playoff run late in the season. But at the same time, those on the bubble can hang around longer, even though the chances of overhauling two or three teams are slim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adrian Dater of the Denver Post dug up this interesting statistic: In January, 48 of 180 games went to overtime or a shootout. That is 26.7 per cent, which means in almost one-third of the games, two teams come away with at least a point. With so many teams chasing so few spots that makes it awfully difficult to get ahead of the crowd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, there are still few committed sellers two weeks before the trade deadline, which has the general managers trying to buy climbing the walls. Just imagine how Blackhawks general manager Stan Bowman feels right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corey Crawford may still be Chicago's goalie of the future but neither he nor Ray Emery are stopping many pucks right now. Bowman needs an experienced goaltender immediately but the one that should be available, Evgeni Nabokov, is off the market because New York Islanders GM Garth Snow thinks his team still has a shot at the playoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nabokov, 36, is the perfect rental player because he's playing well, has a minimal cap hit at $570,000 (all currency U.S.) and will be an unrestricted free agent in July. But all that's available now for the Blackhawks is Nikolai Khabibulin of the Edmonton Oilers. He's three years older at 39, is inconsistent and has one year left on his contract with a cap hit of $3.75-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar problems confront other GMs, as players such as Teemu Selanne, Lubomir Visnovsky, Ryan Malone and perhaps Hal Gill are disappearing from the market because their GMs think there's still a chance to make the playoffs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PLAYER TO WATCH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boston Bruins goaltender Tim Thomas is doing nothing to dispel a growing sentiment he is half a bubble off centre. Politically, he is way off-centre, and his right-wing views once again stirred up enough trouble to reignite talk the Bruins might look at easing Tuukka Rask into a few more starts now that the team is cooling off a little.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem with Thomas is not so much his odd-ball political views (after refusing a visit to the White House and ranting about the “out of control” government, he waded into the contraception debate about the Catholic church last week on his <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page) but his refusal to explain himself. Thomas cannot seem to grasp that a public figure cannot espouse strong beliefs in one forum and then refuse to explain himself when reporters come looking for clarity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The whole thing is beginning to wear on his teammates, according to those who cover the team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">********</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STORYLINES TO WATCH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MULLER REVISITS MONTREAL</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Montreal Canadiens, one of those teams still contemplating an unlikely run to the playoffs, will say hello to the man who could have been their head coach on Monday night. Former assistant coach Kirk Muller, above, who left the Canadiens for a shot as an <span class="companylink">NHL</span> head coach, will be at the Bell Centre for the first time since he was hired by the Carolina Hurricanes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot of people think Muller should have been the one picked to replace Jacques Martin as head coach of the Canadiens when he was fired on Dec. 17. But by then Muller was long gone, having accepted a job last summer to be the head coach of the Nashville Predators' farm team and then moving to the Hurricanes as head coach when Paul Maurice was fired on Nov. 28.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Muller, who was captain of the Canadiens as a player and spent five seasons in Montreal as an assistant coach, was smart enough to dodge the inevitable questions. He declined to say if the Habs coach needs to speak French, being well aware of Cunneyworth's troubles on that issue. He also stepped around those wondering if he quit because he didn't see the Canadiens giving the job permanently to a unilingual coach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was a good time for me to move on,” Muller said. “I have no regrets.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The language issue, Muller said, is “not my area. It's a tough one for me to answer.” Muller said he knows Cunneyworth does not have it easy, “but he's doing a good job.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FLYERS UP AND DOWN</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pittsburgh Penguins get a lot of attention for staying in contention despite losing their star players to injuries, but it's their cross-state rivals who should get more credit for doing the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the long-term losses of defenceman Chris Pronger and forward James van Riemsdyk and many other players to shorter periods because of injuries, the Flyers are still hanging around the top five of the Eastern Conference. They've also had to contend with inconsistent goaltending from their big free-agent acquisition, Ilya Bryzgalov, as well as from youngster Sergei Bobrovsky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, cracks are showing. The Flyers had two big games on the weekend and were smacked around by the New York Rangers on Saturday before facing the Detroit Red Wings on Sunday. The loss to the Rangers prompted Flyers defenceman Kimmo Timonen to question his teammates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm disappointed at the effort, the emotional level [against] a top team in the conference and the league,” Timonen told the Philadelphia Inquirer, “To be honest, I think we had half the guys going and half the guys not.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Flyers went into the Detroit game with a 4-3-3 record in their previous 10 games and were five points ahead of the eighth-place Toronto Maple Leafs. They have four days off until they play the Buffalo Sabres and Penguins later this week and the host of teams in contention for the last few playoff spots are starting to eye the Flyers hungrily.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was enlightening to see the show of affection in Toronto on Saturday night for hero Mats Sundin, who had his number retired before the Maple Leafs' 5-0 pasting by resurgent Montreal. The outpouring of affection by the many wearing No. 13 in the crowd and captured by Hockey Night in Canada was gratifying for a player who always seemed to frustrate Leafs Nation for issues beyond his control.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, Sundin was the butt of sports talk radio for being the cost of Wendel Clark's banishment to Quebec City. St. Wendel was – and remains – the sine qua non of Leaf worthies, and Sundin's arrival seemed to alienate Clark's fans for a while. When Sundin showed himself to be a superior player, the focus moved to the captain's failures to lead the leaky Leafs to the promised land of the Stanley Cup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, Sundin became the bête noire of Leafs fans for his persistent refusal to waive his no-trade clause, frustrating those who felt he should let himself be shipped off to a contender for some No. 1 draft picks. He finally agreed to a move to Vancouver in 2009 only after he'd severed his ties with Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Understandably none of this was mentioned amid Saturday's hosannas to the stoic Swede. Houston hero</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, the Whitney Houston retrospectives following her death Saturday have talked about her concert and movie legacy. But it was a sporting event that fixed her in the American consciousness. It's hard to remember the uncertainty and fear surrounding the Super Bowl in 1991, just days after the launch of the first Gulf War. For Americans in particular, memories of Vietnam haunted them. So Houston's stunning performance of The Star-Spangled Banner served as a balm and an inspiration to her countrymen. It made her a hero and she never was more popular.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the tough question before the Supreme Court of Canada last week. To answer “no” might deprive mentally challenged adults of a voice in court, leaving them virtually unprotected by the law.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The court answered well. Sticking to the text of a 1987 law, which allows mentally disabled adults to testify on a promise to tell the truth, as long as they can communicate evidence, the majority in the 6-3 ruling said it was wrong to ask the Ontario woman to explain what truth means.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A transcript of her questioning at the hands of a Crown attorney and the trial judge shows why this was a sound ruling. The Crown says he is wearing a black gown, and asks her if that is the truth or a lie. “The truth,” she says. “And why is that?” “I don't know.” “Is it a good thing or a bad thing to tell the truth?” “Good thing.” “Is it a good thing or a bad thing to tell a lie?” “Bad thing.” She understands that truth is good, lies are bad. But she can't explain why.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trial judge asks if she has been taught about God. She hasn't been. “What happens if you steal something?” “I don't know.” “Tell me what you think about the truth.” “I don't know.” “Is it important to tell the truth?” “I don't know.” “What's a promise?” “I don't know.” He insists on an explanation that she is not capable of.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all testimony is equal; a judge decides how much weight to give it. But to cut off the possibility of testimony from disabled adults because they have trouble verbalizing what they understand of truth and lies is an arbitrary approach. It doesn't get at what they know, just at what they can explain about what they know.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That 1987 law permitting disabled adults to testify on a promise to tell the truth came after various scandals and studies revealed startling levels of victimization of disabled people. Truth is the only safe ground to stand on, someone once said, and mentally disabled adults should not be arbitrarily denied a piece of that ground.</p>

And, no, sunshine, it wasn't another night of drinking 14 pints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many series, especially those built around one central character, House ran out of steam several years ago. Enough with the mystery ailments, the dyspeptic sarcasm of Dr. House (Hugh Laurie) and the sudden revelation just before the last commercial break. House should have ended when Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) stopped patrolling the hospital in her tight skirts and heels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the great mysteries of life has to be the fact that viewers stick with shows that are ceaselessly repetitive, creaking bores. Herewith, a (short) list of shows that should be cancelled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two and a Half Men. After all the fuss about Charlie Sheen's bizarre departure and the arrival of Ashton Kutcher, the show became merely repulsive. Tonight's episode is called Sips, Sonnets and Sodomy, with characteristic crassness. It comes with this summary: “Strained relationships and girl-fighting result when a huge storm traps Walden, Alan, Zoey and Lyndsey in the house on Valentine's Day.” Whatever. Every day is vulgarity day on this show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bachelor/Bachelorette franchise. Tonight, on The Bachelor (ABC, 8 p.m.) there is a shocking twist, we are informed. Ben cancels a cocktail party! Also, on a trip to Belize, “Lindzi and Ben hover over one of the world's most impressive sinkholes.” There's a joke to be made about the sinkhole that is this dreary narrative of dreadful people feigning romance, but I'm too headachy to make it. And I suspect a lot of viewers are fed up with ,the roses, the fake tears and laughter of nitwits seeking fame on a tawdry show that has long since lost its novelty value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CSI: Miami. It will soon be 10 years since the debut of this spinoff from CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. Ten years of Lieutenant Horatio Caine (David Caruso) taking off his sunglasses and gazing in puzzlement at yet another dastardly act. And then putting his sunglasses back on. Ten years of slow-motion explosions and drug dealers sneering like pantomime villains. Ten years of female characters in implausibly flimsy outfits and Horatio Caine never taking off his sunglasses to look at them. Because he's not that kinda guy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grey's Anatomy. On this week's show, “Amelia arrives at Seattle Grace to beg Derek for help with the gliosarcoma case. Cristina and Owen engage in heated arguments during marriage counselling, and Meredith is given a chance to shine when a man enters the ER after getting his hand stuck in a meat grinder.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's pretty much what's been happening on Grey's since it started. ABC's tagline for Grey's Anatomy used to be “Operations. Relations. Complications.” Over and over, the same three ingredients. And an inevitable moment of emotional vulnerability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit. A weekly reminder that Ice-T can't act. At this point, we know, we know. He's not going to suddenly acquire acting skills, so just make it stop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whitney. Like Ice-T, Whitney Cummings is a tad lacking in acting skills. The show is simply a bunch of garbled jokes about relationships. On this week's episode, Whitney and Alex (Chris D'Elia) go back to the night they first met. Maybe everybody can go back to when this horror didn't air?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before I run out of space here, some other self-explanatory suggestions for instant cancellation – anything with a Kardashian, The Biggest Loser and any show with “Real Housewives” in the title. Wait a minute – also anything with Kevin O'Leary. I think he gave me this headache.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Airing Tonight</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Party Down (bold, 10 p.m.) is one of the more bizarre shows to be found on bold, CBC's artsy channel. Made for U.S. cable, it's a cult show (now cancelled) that failed to find a big audience, but succeeded in being hilarious for a while. It's an ensemble piece about a group of wannabe actors, writers and comics in Los Angeles who pay the rent by working for a catering company. Mockery of showbiz ensues.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mats Sundin had all the right words before the game – and then some – and Dion Phaneuf's brow was appropriately furrowed with gravitas afterward but nobody made a play for the Toronto Maple Leafs during Saturday's 5-0 loss to the Montreal Canadiens. Not one.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so the Leafs now embark on this week's three-game trip to Western Canada riding a three-game losing streak, closing in on what is locally one of the most-anticipated trade deadlines in recent history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big parlour game here for weeks has been defining what is the Leafs biggest need: stud, shut-down defenceman? Goaltender? Big, dominating forward with touch (Sundin Redux, in other words?) Nights like Saturday make the answer obvious: All of the above – which is, of course, impossible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Left for dead, coached in the wrong language and saddled by some of the worst contracts in the game, the Canadiens have won four consecutive games for the first time since October. It will now only take a minor miracle for them to make the playoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Leafs took advantage of Hockey Day in Canada to turn Hockey Night in Canada into Mats Sundin Night. The big Swede was made to feel at home during a pregame ceremony, marking the occasion of the raising of his No. 13 – fittingly, between that of countryman Borje Salming and much-loved former captain George Armstrong – with a profoundly graceful speech. Sundin thanked the appropriate parties, spared a thought for Pat Burns and Wade Belak, Igor Korolev and Alexander Karpovtsev, and stated the case for the 2011-12 Maple Leafs: “Support them, cheer them on … give that extra energy they need to win,” he urged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sundin's relationship with Leafs Nation suffered from the apparent sense of comfort he exhibited while being on a team whose fans felt it punched under its weight and because he really seemed to believe what he reiterated Saturday: that he wouldn't trade his 13 years with the Leafs for anything, including maybe even a Stanley Cup. It was fitting, then, that while he sat in the expensive seats with the rest of the sushi-scarfing Platinum swells Sundin heard boos directed at the current team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They deserved it. The Leafs' top line – Phil Kessel, Joffrey Lupul and Tyler Bozak – disappeared after a few bright flourishes in the first period. So did just about everybody else. In the end, head coach Ron Wilson could only lament the fact that his team couldn't get a save when it needed it. Carey Price stopped all 32 shots he faced, but few were of the quality variety, while Erik Cole, Rene Bourque, Max Pacioretty and Lars Eller all scored second-period goals on just seven shots at James Reimer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wilson's best line was that of Dave Steckel, Mike Brown and Darryl Boyce, who had 14 of the 19 hits dished out by Leafs forwards. This was an abysmal defensive effort, whether it was John-Michael Liles and Cody Franson blindly firing pucks up the centre of the ice, Carl Gunnarsson doing a defensive fly-by with his stick as Cole moved in for his first goal or Phaneuf turning over or mishandling the puck or simply giving up as Eller swerved in front of Reimer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reimer was replaced by Jonas Gustavsson to start the third, and after dealing with his usual post-game media responsibilities with his usual, ever-present half-smile, Reimer buried his head in his hands as the media scrum moved on to find redder meat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was only when reporters started to file out of the dressing room that he shed his skates and goalie pads. Wilson was right when he said later that the Canadiens dictated the tempo of the game from the start: 29 first-period whistles by his accounting, then five men back after a makeable save was not made on a first goal. The Canadiens, Wilson said, “worked the counter-punch.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Leafs? They turtled. Sundin heard boos and must have wondered how much has really changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">******</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JEFF BLAIR'S MORNING SHOT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more you see of Dwane Casey the more there is to like about the Toronto Raptors head coach. There's nothing he can do about the exaggerated sense of fairness shown established opponents by NBA officials, but he's shown he can pull the strings with an under-manned team the way Jay Triano never could with a fully constituted roster. Sunday, Casey made strategic use of Jamaal Magloire late in the first half to find a post-up checkmate to Andrew Bynum and stem a tide that was rolling in the Los Angeles Lakers' favour. Friday, he busted the Boston Celtics' zone with timely re-entry of Linas Kleiza and Jose Calderon into the game in the fourth quarter. He has managed Calderon's minutes shrewdly in the absence of Jerryd Bayless, and Calderon has responded with strong back-to-back games ahead of Tuesday's visit of the New York Knicks and flavour of the month Jeremy Lin.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Author of The North American Idea: A Vision of a Continental Future</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albert Einstein, who knew something about ideas, once wrote: “A great thought begins by seeing something differently, with a shift of the mind's eye.” It's time for Canada, the United States and Mexico to change the way they see each other and the way they address their shared problems. The failure to make that change has resulted in chronic problems and lost opportunities.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider this case. During the recession, all three governments decided to stimulate their economies without considering their interdependence. In its 2009 bill, the U.S. Congress included a “Buy American” provision to bar Canada, Mexico and other countries from supplying iron, steel or manufactured goods for public projects. The provision violated the North American free-trade agreement and Canada rightly protested, spending substantial funds lobbying Congress and negotiating a waiver. The U.S. finally relented, but, last September, President Barack Obama asked Congress for a jobs bill with a similar provision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. perception of its neighbours didn't change, and the “Buy American” idea spread into a huge movement. A Harris poll found that 61 per cent of Americans preferred products “made in America.” In his new book, Bill Clinton recommends the website, “How Americans Can Buy American,” and Mr. Obama's State of the Union address was a rallying cry for the same theme.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeking a “Canadian exemption” against such a movement is like trying to stop a tsunami with your hands. Instead of trying to eliminate a negative, Canada should try to catch the wave with an affirmative. Inserting just one word – “North” – in the middle of the “Buy American” movement might do that and begin to change the way Americans think about themselves and their neighbours. When Americans think about North America, however, they include Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Buy North American” could be the mantra for helping the U.S. recognize the importance of both neighbours. Few Americans know that the two key markets for their exports and source of energy imports are Canada and Mexico. Our trade with each other enhances our collective competitiveness because many of those goods are jointly produced with parts from all three countries. Thus, the best way to multiply our exports and accelerate growth would be to create a seamless market and construct a North American transportation and infrastructure grid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that's needed is “a shift of the mind's eye.” Once we recognize the economies of scale that derive from a continental market, we'll look for ways to reduce the speed bumps that were introduced after 9/11. Once we understand the benefits of working together to address challenges such as jobs, immigration, drug trafficking, energy and the environment, then new opportunities will present themselves to create jobs, facilitate labour mobility, reduce drug trafficking, and balance our shared goals in energy security climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The “North American idea” has to be big enough to inspire people in all three countries to forge a formidable region able to compete with a dynamic East Asia. Minds won't be changed by dealing with each neighbour, one issue at a time. To convince Americans that they shouldn't turn inward, they need to see both of their neighbours collaborating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Canada would join with Mexico to promote “Buy North American” instead of each country seeking an exemption, Canadians might do more than change the policy; we might awaken the U.S. to the continent's promise. Then the three countries would not only co-operate in making decisions on pipelines but in building high-speed trains connecting Montreal and Toronto with Boston and New York, and Vancouver with California and Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Make no little plans,” said Daniel Burnham, a Chicago architect. “They have no magic to stir man's blood.” Think big about what three sovereign countries at different levels of development and power could forge if they shifted their minds and bought from all of North America.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision of a Haitian magistrate not to prosecute Jean-Claude “Baby Doc” Duvalier for crimes against humanity is regrettable. For Haitians to have faith in the state, it must be able to hold leaders accountable for their actions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, this is easier said than done in Haiti, which faces so many extraordinary challenges, including rebuilding its infrastructure and institutions, following the devastation of the 2010 earthquake, and strengthening its fragile democracy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During Mr. Duvalier's 1976-1986 presidency, a militia known as the Tonton Macoutes (inherited from his sinister father and predecessor) committed arbitrary detentions, torture, disappearances, rapes and summary executions. Hundreds of Haitians were killed, and hundreds of thousands fled the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Duvalier returned to Haiti in January, 2011, after 25 years in exile, he was charged with human-rights crimes. Many victims of torture came forward. Last month, an investigative magistrate dismissed the more serious charges, ruling that a 10-year statute of limitations had expired. Mr. Duvalier will only face trial for misappropriation of government funds, which has a maximum five-year sentence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The handling of the case reflects the weakness of the justice system, and the enduring political power of Duvalier loyalists, some of whom support the current leader, President Michel Martelly. “There is no appetite for a prosecution against Mr. Duvalier,” says Carlo Dade, a Haiti expert and senior fellow at the University of Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when he was sentenced to house arrest, Mr. Duvalier thumbed his nose at authorities. He was seen dining in fine restaurants in the capital, and even gave a speech at a law school graduation in Gonaives. “Unless this ruling is overturned on appeal, it's just going to be another confirmation that the justice system is always on the side of the rich and the powerful,” says Reed Brody, with Human Rights Watch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Inter-American Court of Human Rights has ruled that statutes of limitations are inadmissible in connection with gross human-rights violations proscribed in international law. The magistrate could have used this legal precedent and allowed complaints from victims of torture to be heard. This would have sent an important signal that no Haitian is above the law.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could only have been better had the record been nominated in 2008 – when she first stepped into the recording studio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The past four years have been an odyssey of penny-pinching and money-raising for Ms. Schaefer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was stalled,” she said. “I ran out of money.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She held a fundraising concert. A good time was had by all. But she still didn't have enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, she held a second performance. And then a third show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friends organized a silent auction in which one of the lots offered a private home concert by Ms. Schaefer. Other lots included donations by local businesses: a shiatsu message, a collection of vegan cookbooks, a weekend retreat on Hornby Island, gift certificates from a tea shop and a tattoo-parlour, four quarts of organic granola – you get the idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most expensive item was an oil painting donated by the celebrated Victoria painter James Gordaneer valued at $2,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The artist had played an unwitting role in inspiring the singer's recording project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had lent her a painting depicting two women atop stools, seen from the rear. She hung it in the room in which her pupils waited their turn for music lessons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She contemplated the painting. Who were these women? What were they waiting for? She developed a concept for her album, which she dubbed The Waiting Room. The songs she wrote told the stories of daydreaming characters whose trajectories brought them to a temporary shared limbo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Waiting rooms are such strange places,” she said. “Waiting rooms bring together people of all descriptions – any age, any cultural background, any smattering of people. Different people collect in these places, yet in the end, everybody's suffering from the same stuff. It's human condition. It's the same across the board.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her debut album, Twelve Easy Pieces, released in 2005, had earned rave reviews. “The best singer/songwriter you've never heard of,” pronounced Monday Magazine. “A great musician with a clear love for jazz and world music,” trilled <span class="companylink">Radio Canada</span>. “She breathes talent, rigour and taste,” trumpeted Montreal's La Presse. The Toronto Star hailed an “exceptional voice, a poet's eye, a courageous heart, and a damn fine set of guitar-picking fingers.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reviewers compared her to Sade, Laura Nyro, Rickie Lee Jones, and even Van Morrison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, she was eager to follow up such a critical success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A high-quality album costs about $40,000 to produce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That's like a down payment on a house,” the singer said. “Imagine making a down payment on a house every two years just to stay current in your profession.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She got a “substantial” grant from the Canada Council, gratefully receiving a cheque for $13,000 in her right hand before passing it off to the recording studio with her left hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The basic tracks of The Waiting Room were laid down over a fortnight at Baker Studios in Victoria four years ago. But she didn't have the money to complete the final mix and edit, so after spending two decades earning her keep as a musician, she took her first 9-to-5 gig.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She became director of the Larsen School of Music.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of her workday was spent behind a desk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a waiting room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That was ironic,” she said. “I met all sorts of interesting characters.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not long ago, she returned to the studio for five intensive days of mixing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I finally saved enough to get it done,” she said, a donation from her boss helping put her over the top.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CD will be released at a concert at Alix Goolden Hall in Victoria on March 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The choice for album art was easy. It's the painting that helped inspire her concept.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NDP supporters face a stark choice over the next six weeks: to elect a leader with the best chance of entrenching the party's recent political gains in Quebec and beyond, or to continue dreaming the social-democratic dream.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The former path would end with Thomas Mulcair or perhaps Brian Topp as the next leader; the path of dreams might take them to Peggy Nash or Paul Dewar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These four front-runners and three others debated foreign policy Sunday in Quebec City. The day was difficult for Mr. Dewar. Though I am woefully unqualified to judge, the consensus within The Globe, among other media and on the Twitterverse was that Mr. Dewar was demonstrably uncomfortable during the debate. He spoke haltingly at times, often relied on his notes and struggled when forced to improvise in response to challenges by rival candidates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How Mr. Dewar hopes to hold Quebec, whose support for the NDP in the last election must be considered ephemeral, is hard to understand. French Canadians are understandably no less impatient with leaders who are not comfortable in their language than English Canadians are with those who can't speak theirs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But leadership is about more than linguistic fluency. The NDP must also decide whether it wants to govern the country by broadening its appeal to centrist voters or to continue carrying the torch of social and environmental activism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mulcair, who is perhaps the leading contender among the pragmatists, reminded the audience in Quebec City and on television of his experience as a cabinet minister in Jean Charest's government – though that reminded everyone as well that he is a former Liberal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Topp, who is also from Quebec and who served as a former senior advisor to the late Jack Layton, stressed that the NDP is “one step from government,” having climbed the ladder that he helped construct to Official Opposition status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Topp was thrown on the defensive, however, when both Mr. Dewar and Ms. Nash pointed out that he lacked a seat in the House of Commons. There is general agreement within the NDP that the sooner interim leader Nicole Turmel can be relieved of her duties, the happier everyone – including, no doubt, Ms. Turmel – will be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Topp is also more bullish than Mr. Mulcair on raising taxes to pay for the NDP's activist agenda, which could be a hard sell to voters not already committed to the party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Nash, a Toronto MP, performed better in French that Mr. Dewar, though below the level of either Mr. Mulcair or Mr. Topp. She and Mr. Dewar stressed the need to restore Canada's reputation as a peacekeeper not a warmonger, a leader in the fight against climate change rather than a cheerleader for the oil sands. This could be a challenging position to defend in the West, a traditional base of NDP support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nathan Cullen, a British Columbia MP whose leadership campaign hinges on co-operation with the Liberals, said that when Stephen Harper was in China, “he spoke only with pandas and not with Tibetans.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem for Mr. Cullen is that none of the other candidates support talks with the Liberals, which Ms. Nash described as “an old party that has nothing to do with our future.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may be so, but before dismissing the Liberals as yesterday's party, NDPers should perhaps consider two questions:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, which is more likely to appeal to non-Conservative voters: the pragmatic if sometimes infuriatingly vague Liberal approach to foreign policy, energy policy, trade policy and tax policy, or the purity of the NDP's pro-Kyoto, anti-pipeline, pro-tax, anti-free trade stand?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, who is most likely to galvanize voters who want to see the end of Stephen Harper: Bob Rae or Paul Dewar? Bob Rae or Tom Mulcair? Bob Rae or Peggy Nash? Bob Rae or Brian Topp?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those may be the questions that matter most.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Question</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My husband is having panic attacks, trouble sleeping and has felt “dull,” “empty” and “disconnected” from me and his friends for months. His work and home life are stable. I think he's depressed – he's used the word. Our doctor seems to feel he should “get over it” as he doesn't have anything to complain about. He recommended a counsellor who suggested relaxation exercises. I'm not trying to push pills on my husband, but he needs more treatment than breathing exercises on a brochure. How do we get someone to take this seriously?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is difficult enough to ask for help but when your family physician doesn't take it seriously and your husband's concerns are not validated, it can compound his psychological distress. A brochure of breathing exercises trivializes a condition that sounds deserving of prompt medical treatment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The symptoms of depression include hopelessness, loss of interest in activities he used to enjoy, fatigue, changes in appetite, early morning awakening and difficulty concentrating. If he has felt symptoms for most of the day, nearly every day for two weeks, it might be a sign of clinical depression, according to Katy Kamkar, a clinical psychologist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health's psychological trauma program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Depression and anxiety can occur at the same time, said Dr. Kamkar, noting that “it is not uncommon to experience panic attacks … that are cued or triggered by specific stressors.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anxiety can vary in severity from mild uneasiness to panic and it can vary in frequency from occasional distress to constant unease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hallmark features of all anxiety disorders, she wrote in an e-mail, include the following: feeling anxious when placed in specific situations, the tendency to underestimate our coping abilities, excessive fear, difficulty coping with daily activities, the tendency to overestimate danger and difficulty tolerating uncertainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I bet you are more than a little frustrated with your family doctor right now. Maybe he was having an off day and didn't take your husband's condition seriously enough. Or he's had such a miserable time trying to obtain timely referrals for other patients that he just wanted to make sure your husband got quick help from a counsellor. Whatever the case, you need him to help your husband.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Make an appointment with the physician and say these three things: Thank him for the referral to the counsellor, let him know you followed the counsellor's advice, and tell him that unfortunately it didn't have the impact you were all hoping for. Whatever you do, do not leave that room until you have a plan, which should include a referral to a psychiatrist or other mental health professional for your husband.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘This is my voice!” Tim Hudak shouted, during the crescendo of the most important speech he's given since last October's Ontario election.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obvious though this may have seemed, the underlying argument was a winning one for Progressive Conservatives gathered in Niagara Falls this weekend. Their leader is vowing to start talking about stuff that matters – to him, to them, to the province – rather than just be an automaton spewing focus-group-tested talking points. Acknowledging his campaign focused too much on “secondary issues,” he now promises a big-picture economic vision, delivered seriously rather than glibly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Better late than never, and not just because it helped earn 79 per cent in his leadership review. On Wednesday, the long-awaited release of economist Don Drummond's report on public-service reform will kick into high gear the debate about how to tame a $16-billion deficit. Meanwhile, Mr. Drummond and others are projecting less than 2-per-cent annual economic growth. A youngish conservative leader, with fresh ideas about how to make things better, has a big window.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, he just has to figure out what those ideas are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be a big stretch to suggest Mr. Hudak articulated serious plans for economic renewal or fiscal sustainability in Saturday's speech.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The basic principles he laid out – that government shouldn't try to pick winners and losers, that it should only do things it needs to do – are vagaries he offered during the last campaign, on the rare occasions he wasn't advocating chain gangs or attacking “foreign workers.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hudak has been a little more specific at other points recently. But when he's pushed specific policies, it's been more to drive the news cycle than propose major changes to the way the province is run. A mandatory public-sector wage freeze could bring some savings over the next couple of years; it wouldn't do much to address structural problems that threaten the future of public services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's no great shame Mr. Hudak doesn't have the big answers yet. He's spent the past few months adjusting to new political realities, including his role in the province's first minority legislature since the 1980s. And the truth is, nobody has the answers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. McGuinty, with tax reforms and a green-energy jobs strategy and even his commissioning of Mr. Drummond, has tried harder to find them. And these are the efforts that will soon be expected of someone who wants to take over the stewardship of Ontario during one of the most daunting periods in its history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the next few months, we'll learn much about whether Mr. Hudak is up to the task.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are considerable attributes that have been evident even through his struggles to date. He's a quick brief. He's personally disciplined. He takes criticism well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What he has not yet demonstrated, at least publicly, is much curiosity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the time for Mr. Hudak to do what Mr. McGuinty has done over the years: indulge his inner policy wonk by looking to other jurisdictions for solutions that haven't landed here yet, or seeking out experts in their fields and learning from them. If he can settle on fresh policies, then find straightforward and compelling ways to present them to voters, he might finally be able to present himself as a premier-in-waiting rather than just an opposition politician.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding his voice, or at least a more appealing one than we heard last campaign, is relatively easy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figuring out what he wants to say with it is the tricky part.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am pregnant and I want to work out. Can you give me some guidelines?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ANSWER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before you start any exercise routine, make sure your doctor has given you the “all clear.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your exercise routine prior to this pregnancy is a big indicator of what you can do while pregnant. A good general rule of thumb is: Don't take up new sports or fitness activities while pregnant. Do what you are used to, just decrease the intensity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you have never been a regular exerciser, be careful during workouts, especially during the first trimester. Try gentle cardiovascular activity like walking or swimming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listen to your body. Do things that feel comfortable. Stop if things feel abnormal, if your hands or feet begin to swell, or if you feel pain, become dizzy or develop extreme fatigue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things to be aware of:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In your second and third trimester, never do exercises that involve lying on your back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stop doing any type of crunch motion if you notice any abnormal separation in your abdominal wall. A diastasis recti is a widening and softening of the tissue that holds the rectus abdominals together and causes separation of the two halves of the abdominals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keep your workouts at a low to moderate intensity. Always make sure you can talk comfortably during the workout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal of working out should not be to lose weight, or get a personal best in a race. Use exercise as a way to feel good, be social and decrease any of the uncomfortable aspects of pregnancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lift light weights for 12 to 15 repetitions. Include exercises that help with posture and improve core strength. Posture and core exercises can help alleviate back pain. Do not do excessive stretching, or any stretches that involve pulsing or bouncing. Make sure you hydrate properly and consume adequate pre- and post-workout nutrition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRAINER'S TIP</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consistency, not intensity, is what is important. Aim for 30 minutes of exercise every day, versus two or three big workouts a week.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around this time last year, I was in Montreal, writing about chef Jérôme Ferrer of the restaurant Europea when he told me about a big Valentine's event he had organized in the historic downtown Birks store. Tables for two, covered in white linen, would be scattered about the ground floor of the imposing neo-classic building. A gourmet menu would be served. Musicians would roam about. Couples would be all dressed up amidst the grandeur, in between the glass cases of jewels. And there would be a banquet of diamond rings and other jewellery set out, tempting the courage of every man and the hope of every woman.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sound romantic? I thought so too – at first. And then I thought, naw, it's all too arch. On such a stage, what can really be said? With everyone watching in a public setting, one has a tendency to act out the expected script, flirting and smiling and saying all the right things. How many of us have purposely gone out to dinner with someone, not because of what you want to say but because of what you want to avoid discussing? Love in a restaurant setting can be as insipid as a Hallmark card. It's true it can also be proof that a couple enthralled with one another creates their own world, oblivious to their surroundings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But often, when you're on show in your perfect dress with your hair just right, you can end up fulfilling the cultural idea of what love should sound and feel like. It's about others' view of you, not your own reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'd rather spend the night that's marketed as the most romantic of the year at home with my guy, making a nice little dinner together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That there can be pleasure in the quiet comfort of the domestic comes as a surprise perhaps because it isn't always so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We often spend our lives in a conflicted relationship with the place we call home. As Samuel Johnson wrote: “To be happy at home is the ultimate result of all ambition.” It is the place that holds the greatest power over our emotions. Home sweet home is just as easily home toxic home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I can call up scenes from my youth that took place in certain houses that fill me with longing, a sense of security and happiness. My emotional life is rooted in the physical details – the memory of a floral wallpaper in my bedroom when I was 11, the texture of the white shag rug (it was the late sixties), the view from the dormer window over the rooftops of Montreal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others, of course, aren't as lucky. “I would come home from school in the afternoon, put my key in the lock and pray that she was out. I dreaded the dead air in the apartment, which was heavy with unhappiness,” writes Ruth Reichl, in her 2010 memoir, Not Becoming My Mother.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet, despite the happiness or not of the family home, by the time the teenage years come along, most of us ache to escape it. It's all part of the archetypal journey of becoming yourself, I know, but it seems so deeply ironic to me – that the place that formed you is the one you reject, at least for certain periods. Which underscores the powerful influence it has.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have seen this rejection in myself as well as in my own boys, now young men. And you just hope, as a parent, that once they leave, they will want to return – not to live (I am all for encouraging boomerang children to fling themselves back out the door) but to visit, to have home be a touchstone, a still point in the kaleidoscope of their lives, reminding them of where they started and how far they've come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps, though, the home that involves the greatest conflicts is the one we create for ourselves as adults. It is our psychological mirror – where we reconcile and plan experiences, the place in which we assemble our pieces, bits from the past we haven't rejected but need as reminders, things we think we are in the present or might become in the future. All of it is stuff; mental furniture; an architecture of intended happiness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it doesn't always fulfill the dream we have for it, of course, especially as women. We marry, and the home becomes the expression of domestic bliss, a concrete sign of commitment. But with the arrival of children and increased domestic responsibilities, the home can feel like a prison, creating resentments and restricting who we are at the same time as it partly defines us. That the term “stay-at-home Mom” was coined at the time when women were fiercely trying to “have it all” points to our confusion. It immediately suggests a circumscription of experiences, even though many full-time mothers would argue that life at home expands their hearts in ways they could not have imagined. And for any couple in a difficult marriage, the home is the last place you want to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in the happiest of unions, the home retains a power to comfort and irritate, bringing out our love-hate relationship with our inner housewife. I don't think I'm alone when I admit that a spot on a rug can drive me nuts. I can find myself hating a wall colour with the vehemence of a school girl who has taken a sudden dislike to last week's BBF. Then again, I can feel an inordinate amount of serenity and pride in gazing upon a freshly polished countertop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The power that home has over our state of mind, I suppose, is because it is a stage too, just like that Birks store for last year's Valentine's event, but more immediate, more honest. It's where the intimacies of life play out in their own time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our favourite room in the house is painted a deep burgundy red. It is one of the first changes we made when we moved in together. It sets off paintings, little treasures, fresh flowers if we have them, and photographs, too: happy smiling faces of our families, my parents, his parents, some ancestors, and our children in various combinations, his with mine, his with me, mine with him. And we can sit there, eating our special dinner, drinking wine, in our own play, sometimes with dialogue, and sometimes without, not following any script, free of a watching, expectant audience.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Have you heard about the “new” alternative transportation fuel? No, it's not hydrogen, corn ethanol, or biodiesel.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's natural gas, and here's what U.S. President Barack Obama has to say about it. In a recent speech in Las Vegas, he said his administration's Alternative Fuels Plan will help support development of natural gas refuelling infrastructure, along with tax incentives for conversion of truck and bus fleets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Because of new technologies … we can now access natural gas that we couldn't access before. We've got a supply … that can last America nearly 100 years. Developing it could power our cars and our homes and our factories in a cleaner and cheaper way,” Mr. Obama told workers at a UPS truck-fuelling site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what is this “new” technology that has made natural gas so plentiful that it can power America's trucks and buses? And is it really new?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As I watched Mr. Obama's televised speech, I reflected back to 1976 when, as young engineer, I supervised the drilling of the first well of our new company, which grew to become North America's biggest natural gas producer, <span class="companylink">Encana Corp</span>. That well was drilled into so-called tight rock that would produce no gas at all when the drilling rig pulled off the site. Then came a fleet of massive trucks carrying hydraulic pumps, tanks full of specially formulated fluids and loads of what we called “frac sand.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When all of this was connected to the wellhead, powerful engines made a deafening roar, driving high pressure pumps that drove a fluid-and-sand slurry down the wellbore, fracturing that tight rock and forcing the porous sand into the gas bearing formation more than 400 metres below. When the trucks had pulled off the site, I opened the valve and out came natural gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what is now called “fracking” isn't fundamentally new at all. But over the decades, technologies enabling the drill bit to be turned horizontally into the gas-bearing rock, along with extremely sophisticated fracturing fluid chemistry, have unlocked more and more “tight” gas. Now the brass ring – getting gas to flow commercially from enormously plentiful shale deposits – has been seized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using natural gas as a transportation fuel isn't a new concept, either. Statistics compiled by the International Association for Natural Gas Vehicles indicate there are 13 million natural gas-fuelled vehicles worldwide. And the “green highways project” has brought together South Korea, China, Thailand and 17 other Asia-Pacific countries in a massive strategy for natural gas-fuelled vehicles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that the United States has the world's largest fleet of high fuel-consumption trucks and buses, the Alternative Fuels Plan's support for natural gas has staggering potential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also a major opportunity for suppliers of natural gas motor-fuel technology, including Canadian companies. (IMW Industries, of Chilliwack, B.C., is a leading supplier of natural gas refuelling equipment, exporting it to 25 countries including China. And Vancouver-based <span class="companylink">Westport Innovations Inc</span>. is a leader in technology to convert diesel engines to natural gas.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The creation of transportation corridors for natural gas-fuelled trucks, and the conversion of smelly urban buses to clean-burning natural gas, helps the environment. It also offers big opportunities for companies in the supply chain of refuelling stations, high-pressure fuel tanks and truck engines. But if Canada doesn't move forward soon, it will be difficult for Canadian natural gas fuel-technology companies to keep up with their U.S. counterparts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what's the plan for converting Canada's truck and bus fleets to natural gas?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, natural gas producers, transporters, distributors and equipment manufacturers joined together in the Canadian Natural Gas Vehicle Alliance to develop the “Natural Gas Use in the Canadian Transportation Sector Roadmap,” which focuses on converting truck and bus fleets, both urban and highway, to natural gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After meetings in Ottawa in December, Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver agreed to provide support for implementation of this initiative, including two regional truck-fleet support hubs and development of updated codes and standards for natural gas vehicles. This work needs to be a top priority, so Canadian companies aren't left stranded on the new natural gas-fuelled highway.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've entered an era of indifference where the “two solitudes” are more separate than ever. It's like a couple that's drifted so far apart the partners don't even feel the need to quarrel.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebeckers have lost the thin interest they had about the rest of Canada, where, on the other hand, there is a growing feeling of irritation mounting against Quebec – Quebec and its fat equalization payments that serve to finance fancy programs like $7-a-day daycare. This anger is still muted and expressed in rather polite terms – this is English Canada after all – but it is bound to increase as the centre of gravity moves to the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario and Quebec (or at least their respective political elites) were once the backbone of the old order – the guardians of what used to be called “national unity” – but Ontario is broke and is now turning inward. Quebec is even more broke and even more self-centred than it used to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last census shows that more people live west of Ontario than east of it. Quite logically, it is the West that calls the shots. For the first time in Canadian history, the federal government is a direct emanation of the West, and its policies reflect a socially conservative yet economically dynamic Western culture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How long will the equalization system resist the “westernization” of the country? The West has become the country's economic powerhouse. Unlike Ontarians, Western Canadians never paid much attention to Quebec and never anguished over the question of “what Quebec wanted.” The distance is too great, geographically and culturally, and it doesn't help that Quebec demonizes the resources industry and the tar sands to which Quebeckers actually owe their standard of living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some days ago, a group of academics from Toronto and Montreal met in Toronto to try and revisit the constitutional wars of the 1970s and 80s, and discuss how Canadians might be convinced to reopen the Constitution so that, among other changes, Quebec could be recognized as a “nation.” No one among the hundred constitutional experts present thought it would be possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And frankly, they shouldn't have gone through the trouble of organizing the conference, since the answer was highly predictable. In both Quebec and the rest of Canada, the word “Constitution” is essentially a dirty word that practically nobody wants to hear – except maybe the constitutional experts who'd like to revive their careers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Political scientist David Cameron, one of the organizers of the conference, said his stomach turned when he heard, at the meeting, former PQ premier Bernard Landry and former Liberal minister Brian Tobin rehash the same old debate with the same old arguments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let the Constitution rest. Reopening it would turn into a horrible slugfest, every province and pressure group demanding their own amendments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the recognition of Quebec as a nation would not even kill the separatist movement. The sovereigntists were unhappy with Meech and never really wanted constitutional reform from the beginning. All they did was exploit the failure of Meech because it served their goal of painting Canada in a bad light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If, by some miracle, a brand-new constitution filled with loving words for Quebec were brought to them on a silver plate, they would say it's too little too late. And this makes sense. If you want Quebec to have the full powers of an independent country, why would you settle for a lame compromise?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her tragic end was perhaps not unexpected but startling at first glance, then painful: Who does not remember (or know of) the radiantly beautiful 22-year-old girl and her astonishing 1985 self-titled album?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astonishing, not for the many prizes it won or records it broke, but for the first sustained hit of that voice, a scale-leaping powerhouse that felt like the very movement of the Music of the Spheres (that Elizabethan cosmological notion of the rolling sound of perfect harmony; of perfect love.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every inch the diva – big, lacquered hair; a mask of makeup; talons, sky-high heels and glittering, sculptured gowns, Ms. Houston confessed to be overwhelmed by all of this glam-armature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was, after all, the worst kind of diva: the tragic disaster-in-waiting, great of stature and brokenhearted, like Piaf, Holiday or Callas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, like Garland, who also died at 48, she was violently mocked, toward the end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No longer: the public outcry is great and likeminded: “a beautiful angel,” reads a typical tweet “now singin in heaven.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typical – but kindhearted, given that “#CrackKills” trended simultaneously with the dreadful news of the artist having died at the Beverly Hilton hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the early afternoon, in a bathtub, possibly surrounded by a narrative of pill bottles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was to have made a rare appearance at the Grammys on Sunday, and receive an award.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A video has emerged of her singing Jesus Loves Me briefly on Thursday with Kelly Price, who looks lovesick in Ms. Houston's warm, queenly presence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alternatively, her lifelong friend and mentor Clive Davis went on to throw a pre-Grammy party in the hotel, exactly four floors below the site where her poor body was being scrutinized by coroners: “She loved music and she loved this night that celebrated music,” he explained, weakly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stories and tributes are being hastily assembled, forlorn rumours about her, ironically, joining the judges on The Voice (she was once known by this name). But in truth, Ms. Houston, once the biggest female singer in the world, had all but disappeared from sight, after a fractured comeback, beginning with the release of 2009's very successful I Look to You, and ending with a trip to a rehab clinic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the middle of this comeback, which feels so fragile now, Ms. Houston finally admitted – to Oprah Winfrey – that she was an addict. She explained how to smoke rock and she said she had lost herself in the drugs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was a far cry from the imperious lady who told Diane Sawyer, incredibly, in 2002, that she was clean; that “Crack is cheap.” “Crack is whack,” she infamously snapped, evoking Keith Haring's graffiti in a ball court near the Harlem River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Incredible because she and her then-husband Bobby Brown were clearly high all the time: By 2006, the Enquirer would glibly publish photographs of Ms. Houston's private bathroom: a filthy pig's sty, filled with squalid drug paraphernalia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Houston seemed to be trying this time. She divorced her volatile husband; she tried to mother her wild daughter; and she appeared in public overweight: great news for a crack addict, yet still she was ridiculed, now for being fat and unattractive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She went on tour, and was booed, and stormed out on, especially for a wretched version of I Will Always Love You, performed at London's O2 in 2010. The video is hard to watch: She tries to climb the notes and cannot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Houston spoke, plaintively, of her voice's mulishness this way: “Sometimes the old girl sings, but not tonight. I want to do it, but she doesn't want to.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was this song, always this mammoth anthem, this vocal feat of strength, that defined her. It formed the plot of her hit film, 1992's The Bodyguard; it trounced her other, upbeat or sweetly sad, Number 1 songs by sheer virtue of its presence: To hear the song, whether you like it or not, is to witness a natural miracle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A miracle like “The Voice” itself, extended to Ms. Houston, it seems, by God Himself, on a glass platter, both of which she took great time and effort to smash into bits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was in pain; she hurt. How does this concern us?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the centre of the song, written by the wondrous Dolly Parton, Ms. Houston extends the following blessing to listeners: “I hope life treats you kind. And I wish you joy and happiness”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Did we hope the same for her?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or did we watch, from an aloof distance, her anguish, as though living people are characters in such tragedies as Macbeth and Valley of the Dolls: object lessons and communicable illnesses to be wary of; despaired of, in the abstract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shame on those who booed the old girl: Ms. Houston's voice, and her, its unhappy messenger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May this wanting, ragged soul find its way home, with our heartfelt, terrible regrets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RISE AND FALL / THE STAR-CROSSED CAREER OF WHITNEY HOUSTON</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Family Affair</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The daughter of soul/gospel singer Cissy Houston, the niece of disco dynamo Thelma Houston and cousin of Dionne Warwick, Whitney Houston was a pop package born of a musical family and polished by Clive Davis, the <span class="companylink">Arista Records</span> founder. Her self-titled debut album in 1985 showcased a charming presence and a powerhouse voice on sweeping ballads (Saving All My Love For You) and high-energy hook-pop (How Will I Know).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sophomore Success</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 1987, with the release of Whitney, urban radio was all essentially all-Houston, all the time. If listeners weren't hearing one of the singer's seven consecutive number-one hits – including new ones I Wanna Dance With Somebody, So Emotional and Where Do Broken Hearts Go – they were hearing records made in the same plush or upbeat style by others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soul Train Doesn't Stop in Houston</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Houston didn't often show her gospel roots, and was aloof to the rise of hip hop. She was booed during the Soul Train Awards in 1989, and told Katie Couric in 1996 that she was hurt by criticism that she wasn't “black enough” for urban music audiences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, Say Can She Sing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fighter-planes-overhead production of the 1991 Super Bowl was criticized in some quarters as jingoistic – the United States was still involved in the Persian Gulf war at the time – but the track-suited singer's soaring, immaculate performance of The Star Spangled Banner before the game was one for the ages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Bobby Brown</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The singer's clean image changed in 1992 when she married bad-boy R&amp;B artist Bobby Brown. Though she starred opposite Kevin Costner in the 1993 Hollywood blockbuster The Bodyguard (which spawned the mammoth hit I Will Always Love You), she also told Rolling Stone: “I am nobody's angel. … I can get raunchy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She Got Raunchy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Erratic behaviour became the norm for Ms. Houston, who became familiar with drug-rehabilitation facilities. “The biggest devil is me,” she told ABC's Diane Sawyer in an infamous 2002 interview in which she declared “crack is wack.” Mounting another comeback in 2009 with I Look To You, a concert in Central Park lacked the vocal power she once marshalled so easily. Her strength was gone.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's time for the federal government to respect the law – and get serious about saving killer whales.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not the view of a bunch of woolly headed environmentalists, but of the Federal Court of Appeal, which has declared that the Minister of Fisheries acted illegally by ignoring provisions of the Species at Risk Act designed to protect critical habitat. “Ministerial discretion does not legally protect critical habitat within the meaning … of the Species at Risk Act, and it was unlawful for the minister to have cited provisions of the Fisheries Act in the killer whales Protection Statement,” the court found. Not just wrong-headed or short-sighted – but unlawful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ruling, issued on Feb. 9 means the government of Canada has got to start protecting habitat vital to the survival of killer whales on the West Coast. And that means a whole lot of ocean has to be managed differently – with everything from fish farms, to new docks, to tanker traffic seen through a different lens. “We feel really good about this ruling,” says Gwen Barlee, policy director of the Wilderness Committee, which was one of nine environmental groups that pursued the case with the help of Ecojustice, a non-profit law organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a strong decision, a unanimous decision by three judges, and we are hoping the government will now stop dragging its feet and will start protecting killer whales and all the other endangered species in Canada,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ecojustice has been working on the case for years, first winning a decision in the Federal Court of Canada in 2010, and then having that ruling reinforced when the government went to the Federal Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When SARA was enacted in 2002, it required the government to issue plans to protect any species at risk of becoming extirpated or extinct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In British Columbia, two populations of killer whales – 85 southern residents and 205 northern residents – fall into that category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One section of SARA requires the government to identify the critical habitat of endangered species, and to set out how that habitat will be protected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Fisheries Minister Keith Ashfield sought to dodge that requirement, arguing that the Fisheries Act already provided him ways to protect marine species and that he had discretionary powers to use those regulations, rather than SARA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the court said the government can't do that – SARA is not an act that can simply be swept aside at a minister's discretion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I do not accept the minister's interpretation of the SARA. … Its intent was to provide for compulsory and non-discretionary legal protection from destruction for the identified critical habitat of listed endangered or threatened aquatic species,” stated Mr. Justice Robert Mainville of the Federal Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environmental groups argue Ottawa has been trying to avoid identifying critical habitat because once it has done that, it has to take steps to protect that habitat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the West Coast, that means among other things that the government will have to ensure that a proposed increase in oil-tanker traffic doesn't damage critical killer-whale habitat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed Enbridge Northern Gateway Project, which would see a new twin pipeline running from near Edmonton to a port at Kitimat, would result in some 225 tankers a year plying B.C.'s North Coast. And yes, killer whales live there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What would it mean if we had an oil spill?” asks Ms. Barlee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As uncomfortable as it is, that's a question Ottawa must now answer. And it must have killer-whale experts provide that answer, not politicians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Exxon Valdez ruptured its hull on a reef in Prince William Sound in 1989, killer whales were seen surfacing in the oil slick. Over the next year, 14 of 36 whales in that pod vanished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the court ruling, the government must produce a plan to save killer whales on a coast where there are increasing development pressures. Protection from oil spills and acoustic disruption, particularly in key breeding and feeding areas, must be among the things assured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, the government's got its work cut out for it – and the courts say it is unlawful for Ottawa to shirk that responsibility.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's Jann Arden, perched on a stool in a downtown Toronto hotel, telling me this. In town for the start of her cross-Canada tour for her new album, Uncover Me 2, she's as comfortable as a down duvet, pillowy of thought and of body, dressed all in flowing black and peeking out from behind the middle-parted curtain of her long, dark hair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that comment was the first glimpse into a part of her persona she rarely reveals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't be fooled. The sweetheart of Canadian music is a tumbleweed diva.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everything she has been talking about in the interview comes out with expletives and a down-home twang, like a hardscrabble story shared on a street corner of a Prairie town or in a truck stop, over a bad cup of coffee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were her father's drunken years, the time he left her, her younger brother Pat and a friend in the car for hours when he disappeared inside a tavern. (She ended up having to drag him out.) There's the story of her older brother, Duray Richards, troubled since his teenage years and convicted of murder the same year she signed with Universal almost 20 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those early, difficult years are chronicled in the multi-award-winning singer's new autobiography, Falling Backwards. Listening to her, though, it becomes obvious: She is her story, but she has also transcended it. Ms. Arden is a fixture in the Canadian culture as someone who never wanted to escape it. She herself understands that “I'm the personification of what a Canadian celebrity is. It's almost an oxymoron – a Canadian celebrity. I don't care about fame.” But just because she's a hardy tumbleweed, and not a tall poppy, that doesn't mean she's unaware of her persona and how it serves her. It's one thing to be influenced by the circumstances of one's youth without realizing it. And it's quite another to stand back from it all, understand it, and having survived it, write and laugh about it, seeing your parents as characters colourful enough to belong in a novel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My parents are the smallest-boned friggin' people you've seen in your whole life,” she tells me. “They should be on a key chain.” She even quotes them on the back of her book.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Arden is rooted in her background. “There's no place I [would rather] be than there,” she says of her Calgary home, located only four kilometres from where she was born.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her parents live in a house right behind hers on property she bought six years ago. “It's the only place I want to go back to. The only thing that lets me go out on the road is knowing I can go back there.” She likes to say she's still that little girl with the bad perm who never dreamt about being a star, that nothing has changed. But she has a perspective on the story of her youth that only comes from having experienced some sort of escape from it, which in her case is creativity, music and a fame that made her feel worthwhile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I am the peacemaker,” she says at one point, describing how she travels with her mother every month to Bowden, a medium-security institution in Alberta, to see her brother in jail, who still protests his innocence. She has also facilitated a reconciliation between her two brothers, who had been estranged for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has the ability to see herself at a remove. “I absolutely believe in some divine grace,” she says, when I ask about her spirituality, a question that unlocks the inner diva she tries hard to hide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I've thought myself here,” she explains in a dreamy voice. “I remember meetings with record people and I'm standing outside the room, shaking like a leaf, and feeling very small and insignificant. So I thought, ‘I'm going to send part of me into that room who knows what she's doing and knows she can do it and is tall and pretty – and smart – and I'm going to send her in there and push everybody against the wall. So when I walk in as the other me, I've got room to work. That's what I've always done.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She projects herself as an archetypal brave-yet-vulnerable single woman, who withstands all the mean-spirited discussion about her weight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I look at myself in the mirror and think, ‘Bought and paid for. Everything works … Pretty darn cute, now go find some pants that fit.' I'm just proud of myself. I'm glad to be alive, I've always been like that. I just let Bryan Adams take a picture of me naked. It's out in Zoomer [magazine] in March. It's about women being marginalized … I'm not hurtful toward myself, saying, ‘Oh I hate my arms.' How can you hate your arms? It's your arm! So I said okay” to the nude centrefold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when nudged off the Arden-esque theme of always looking for love and being disappointed, she admits to being difficult in relationships. At nearly 50, she has never married and has no children. Surely there must have been some wonderful romances, I suggest. “Oh, many … there have been a couple that have altered and changed my life to the point where you come out the other end and you're unrecognizable. You know, I've been the hurter and the hurt-ee,” she says. “I don't think I'm easy. I can be extremely selfish.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Honesty has always been Ms. Arden's stock-in-trade. But the country-girl salt-of-the-earth approach to fame is also shrewd. She knows that popularity doesn't always come from fulfilling expectations. “I don't have a team of stylists, coiffing me and spray-tanning me and putting me in glitter gowns coming down a glass staircase.” It can come from confounding them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I hate red carpets. You now have these idiots saying, ‘Who are you wearing?' And I'm like, ‘Winners … and I have a bra from <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span>.'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Arden smiles sweetly and pushes at her hair. She doesn't like to admit it, but the tumbleweed diva has an ego that allows her to rise above the preoccupations of the typically famous.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One time, I went out on St. Valentine's Day for a romantic dinner with a certain person. It did not end well. At the end of the evening, my hat was missing from the coat check. It was a fine hat, purchased in Dublin and a lifesaver in inclement weather. Newly arrived in Canada, I was inconsolable.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever since, I have been dead-set against going out on Valentine's Day. If the subject is broached, I think of the missing hat, and that's the end of the discussion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any case, in this part of the world – the centre of the universe though it is – St. Valentine's Day is hardly the time for traipsing the streets going out for a bite to eat and consuming overpriced cocktails with improbable names. A person is obliged to dress for the weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For gentlemen, this means being mistaken for a chap making his way from the summit of Everest to a base camp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For ladies, it means risking life and limb. Tottering around on heels made and designed for tottering in balmy Italian or French locales, not icy streets in godforsaken wintry cities where cab drivers are specially trained to look out for ladies in their finery and deftly splash said finery with grey slush.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your best bet is to stay at home and watch TV. And ignore the commercials. For weeks, ads have been telling the public to buy some stuff for someone. The message: Don't forget Valentine's Day, or you'll die old and alone. This is hooey. If you sit around and watch TV, alone or in good company, you'll be grand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday night's Glee (Fox, Global, 8 p.m.) is themed for Valentine's Day. Mr. Schuester asks the glee club members to perform the world's best love songs. Also, Rachel's fathers (Jeff Goldblum and Brian Stokes Mitchell) visit McKinley High. Now, there's love in abundance – the two dads and their diva daughter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's plenty of love, affection and wit on TV to warm you on St. Valentine's Day. (Much more warming and long-lasting in impact than your dinky cocktails with improbable names.) And Glee is a great source, from the wacky to the wonderful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was the time lovers Santana and Brittany had the following conversation: Santana: “Brittany, lock the door.” Brittany: “I don't know how to do that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later, Brittany said, “A unicorn is someone who knows he's popular, but isn't afraid to show it.” And told Santana, “Out of all the kids in this school, I think you are the biggest unicorn.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or the time Puck said to Quinn, “You don't need a baby or a dude or anyone to make you special.” Or, indeed, the time dad Burt said to Kurt: “You're gay. You're not like Rock Hudson gay. You're really gay. You sing like Diana Ross and you dress like you own a Magic Chocolate Factory.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Got troubles with self-regarding fools at work? An episode of The Office can warm your heart. Say, the time Michael Scott pronounced on a harmonious workplace. “What is the single most important thing for a company? Is it the building? Is it the stock? Is it the turnover? It's the people. The people! My proudest moment here wasn't when I increased profits by 17 per cent, or cut expenditure without losing a single member of staff. No, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy, first job in the country, hardly spoke a word of English, but he came to me and he went, ‘Mr. Scott, will you be the godfather to my child?' Wow. Just wow! Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And who wouldn't think of romantic love while watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer? Go get the box set. Be reminded. Or just remember the interaction between Buffy and Spike. Buffy: “What are you doing here? In five words or less.” Spike: “Out. For. A. Walk. (Pause) Bitch.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be nice to yourselves today. Hugs and kisses to every one of you. Hatless or not, I appreciate you. I'm sure you're all decent, talented and lovely people. Some of you are outright gorgeous, beautiful, as well as talented and creative. Especially when you watch TV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also airing tonightMargaret Thatcher: The Long Walk to Finchley (TVOntario, 9 p.m.) is an exceptionally fine portrait of Thatcher before political fame and power. It's about the years she spent trying to land a nomination as the Conservative candidate in a constituency in England. Andrea Riseborough is wonderful as the young Thatcher, conveying the mannerisms and style of speaking, and never indulging in the extravagant, showy mimicry Meryl Streep discharged in The Iron Lady.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An off-the-cuff remark made in Toronto last week to more than 600 food industry experts by Galen Weston, executive chairman of Loblaw Cos. Ltd., sparked outrage in farmers' market circles. “Farmers' markets are great … One day they're going to kill some people, though,” he said, quickly adding: “I'm just saying that to be dramatic, though.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shocking comment, perhaps, but the fact of the matter is, it may have already happened. Consumers can contract food-borne illnesses anywhere, including from the stores of supermarket giants such as <span class="companylink">Loblaws</span>. Such is the reality of food systems. Yes, they were strong words from the head of Canada's largest food retailer, but they point out that a broader, more rational debate on food safety is warranted in our country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2003 mad cow crisis in Canada was really the first major food safety-related event our country had experienced. Although domestic demand for beef went up more than 5 per cent the year after the crisis began, it arguably became more of a trade issue than a food safety one. Some safety regulations did change, mostly on the primary production side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then E. coli, botulism and salmonella came, which progressively led us to <span class="companylink">Maple Leaf Foods</span> and the tainted deli-meat crisis of 2008. Maple Leaf's recall changed the psyche of many Canadians on how we manage risks as a country. In the past, we blamed Britain, Mexico and the United States, since many recalled products came from abroad. This time, it was a truly Canadian brand harming fellow Canadians, and it hit our Canadian identity to the core. To cope, many investigations were launched and task forces formed. As a result, several public health and food safety regulations were altered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a country, we spent millions making our food safety systems more robust, while survey after survey suggests that Canadians trust the safety of our foodstuff. What most Canadians don't know is that most of the regulations were unintentionally projected to the larger players within the food industry. Maple Leaf, <span class="companylink">Loblaws</span> and other food processors and distributors have become astute risk managers. Meantime, smaller food businesses are challenged by the extent of new food safety regulations, including those selling foods at farmers' markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian Food Inspection Agency spends more than $350-million on food safety a year – that's $10 for every Canadian – excluding efforts from the provinces and municipalities. We've never had a public dialogue on the proper threshold for public expenditure related to food safety surveillance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For industry, particularly for smaller enterprises trying to develop new markets both domestically and globally, the role of the Canadian food safety regulatory regime has become somewhat of an impediment to innovation and successful commercialization. The overall regulatory and policy framework within which the Canadian food industry operates itself interferes with our ability to effectively support industry in innovation, marketing and commercialization. Most Canadians wouldn't know how difficult it really is to start a business in the food industry, mostly as a result of the array of food safety policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In food safety, the era in which crises dictate how we regulate should end. Since governments are continuously challenged by budgetary shortfalls, what's needed is a more strategic approach on how we make the food industry more accountable to Canadians. We have the science, but more collaboration is warranted. One scenario would be to compel the larger, more resourceful companies to support the smaller ones. This is already happening, but such practices should be encouraged by regulators. Another option would be to customize regulations for smaller outfits without compromising the health of consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We also need to celebrate our successes in food safety. The mere fact that the 2008 Maple Leaf listeria outbreak was discovered early is an achievement in itself. Many food safety experts still believe that we may have had one major outbreak before, but it went undetected. In the past, systems were not equipped to detect the scope and scale of these outbreaks. Regulatory changes stemming from the 2003 SARS outbreak allowed public health officials to recognize the problem early on. And the Maple Leaf affair allowed us to educate ourselves on what was then considered a relatively unknown pathogen.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever you may think of Dustin Penner as a hockey player, one's thing for sure – the Los Angeles Kings' forward is one funny man. It's something that should have been obvious to people a month ago, when back spasms forced him to miss a game against the Columbus Blue Jackets.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The day after, Penner compared his painful, bent-over posture to being in the “third stage of evolution,” a description that should have provided a clue to the humorous context of what came next – an admission that his back problems originally flared up while digging into a stack of his wife Jessica's “delicious” pancakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the nuance of his tone and the timing of his delivery was lost in cyberspace, where it was simply interpreted as the worst kind of dog-ate-my-homework excuse from a slumping player, who'd just missed a game against the NHL's worst team because of a breakfast-related injury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Penner took it on the chin from fans, mostly of them unhappy with his lack of offensive production – only two goals up to that point in the season – and from there, the episode went viral, causing a massive, continent-wide Internet sensation. It's surprising he didn't land on Leno.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Penner did for flapjacks what Colonel Sanders did for chicken and permitted everybody to retell the stories of all the other oddball injuries suffered by professional athletes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday morning, Penner brought the whole thing full circle, turning a negative into a positive by playing host to a pancake breakfast for 75 hungry Kings' fans at an IHOP in Westchester.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">L.A. had just completed a six-game trip the previous night in Dallas, exiled from the Staples Centre by the Grammy Awards, and while the rest of his teammates got the day off, Penner was there at the IHOP, bright, early and right on time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dressed in a Kings' sweater, jeans, flip flops and wearing a chef's hat, Penner served pancakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, he went from booth to booth, signing autographs and chatting up Kings' fans, some of whom had spent hours fighting rush-hour freeway traffic to attend the event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A total of 386 applications were received for the event, but the Kings had to cut it off after 75 because of the restaurant's limited seating capacity. About $3,000 was raised for charity. Penner was trying to put a positive spin on Pancake-gate, acknowledging that he was “obviously too candid” about detailing the terms of his injuries and noting that reporters “can take a certain comment and spin it any way you want. You can put a different slant on it. I guess that's up to the person that had the pen and paper in their hand.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the vitriol directed toward Penner actually came in comments posted by fans – and the legacy of the flapjack fiasco followed him on the Kings' January tour through Western Canada. In Calgary, he was asked to autograph a box of pancake mix. Up in Edmonton, a TV host demonstrated what had happened to the ex-Oiler, using a plate of pancakes as a visual aid. In Vancouver, Penner found a maple syrup bottle placed anonymously on the visitors' bench.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the moment, Penner's issues run deeper than just bad press. Two games ago, the Kings reached into their minor-league system for a pair of young forwards – Dwight King and Jordan Nolan (son of Ted) – pushing Penner to the sidelines as a healthy scratch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that both King and Nolan scored their first NHL goals during Sunday's 4-2 victory over the Dallas Stars would suggest that Penner's press-box exile could continue into Thursday night's date with the Phoenix Coyotes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apart from the back injury, Penner has also missed time this year, with a groin problem, and bruises to both his knee and his hand. There is talk the Kings may trade him before this year's deadline and that old familiar companion, Internet speculation, has Toronto as a possible destination, given that it was Leafs' general manager Brian Burke who originally gave the Winkler, Man., native his professional start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, Penner says he will learn to watch that quiet wit of his more carefully in the sometimes too-literal web world. His back, by the way, is fine again: “Until you've been in that position, you don't know what it's like. It's another injury I wouldn't want to have again.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An hour into Monday's proceedings, Penner took a break to visit with reporters covering the event – two local TV stations, both local newspapers, the representative from nhl.com. At that juncture, Penner still hadn't had a chance to tuck into his breakfast yet, so there was no way of getting an answer to the million-dollar question: How did the IHOP version's of pancakes compared to his wife's?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have to wake up and have some coffee first,” Penner answered. “I've been signing autographs. But I'll get in there yet.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone loves all-day kindergarten. In Ontario, where it was introduced in 2010, it's wildly popular with parents. Grade 1 teachers like it because students arrive better prepared. All-day K is the signature social initiative of Dalton McGuinty, who wants to go down in history as the Education Premier. The only drawback is cost – $1.5-billion a year by the time it's fully implemented. Although deficits have forced the Education Premier to morph into the Austerity Premier, he promises he won't put his favourite baby on the chopping block.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to advocates, all-day kindergarten is much more than a perk for young families. It offers a crucial leg up for disadvantaged children. For this reason alone, it's essential to our prosperity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We can't afford not to do it,” argues Charles Pascal, the Premier's early learning adviser. Twenty-eight per cent of kids who enter Grade 1 are “vulnerable,” meaning they arrive with learning, social or behavioural problems. Without a boost, they'll never catch up. In the long run, Mr. Pascal told CBC Radio, early learning will pay off in better human capital and higher graduation rates. Every 1-per-cent decline in the number of vulnerable kids, he says, will add 1 per cent to GDP. “It's a no-brainer.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actually, it's a brainer. Here's why. The world's biggest early learning program, involving millions of children and billions of dollars of public investment, has now been exhaustively evaluated. The results are unequivocal: It doesn't work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program is Head Start, an iconic preschool program launched in 1965 as part of Lyndon Johnson's “war on poverty.” Today, it includes nearly a million children, the ones who need help the most – poor and minority kids who are at high risk of dropping out and winding up jobless or in jail. The rationale for the program, which offers not only preschool education but also family support, health and dental services and social and mental health services, is that it saves money in the long run. It's cost more than $100-billion since inception.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2002, the U.S. government launched the massive Head Start Impact Study to determine how well the program worked. The final report, released in 2010, was devastating. It found that the modest gains achieved by Head Start students wore off by the end of Grade 1 – they wound up no further ahead than those who weren't in the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You'd think these findings – involving one of the most ambitious social programs in U.S. history – would have been widely publicized. They got almost no coverage at all. Head Start is a classic example of a giant public program that doesn't produce results but creates so many jobs and has so many defenders that no one can get rid of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are big differences between Head Start and all-day kindergarten in Canada, of course. Head Start is aimed at disadvantaged three- and four-year-olds; kindergarten reaches all four- and five-year-olds. Maybe Canadian teachers are so much better they can achieve results that have eluded the Americans. Maybe Head Start is just a bad program. Or maybe its children are so much worse off that nothing works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what we can conclude, from this and other studies, is that the benefits of early childhood education have been vastly overstated. It's not a magic bullet. Which isn't to say that all-day K has no value. It's fabulous for working parents, and cheaper than daycare. Mothers who might otherwise stay home may choose to work, and it creates teaching jobs. But they aren't the benefits we've been sold. And in a world of excruciatingly tough choices, that matters.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, Don Drummond, a former federal government mandarin and bank economist, will present the final report of the Commission on the Reform of Ontario's Public Services.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speculation on what will be in the report is rampant, with reporters parsing every ministerial statement for clues, and anxious interest groups issuing speculative pre-reactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reality is that Mr. Drummond has been around the block a few times. Everyone on the “circuit” – the never-ending conferences, roundtables and inquiries in which experts share wonderful ideas for health reform that are rarely, if ever, implemented on a large scale – has a pretty good idea what he is going to say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are the Top 10 messages you can expect:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1) There is no magic bullet: The health system doesn't require radical surgery but long-term therapy. Incremental change in several areas is how the system is going to be made sustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2) Across-the-board cuts don't work. They were an abject failure in the 1990s. They are a recipe for short-term pain and no long-term gain. You need to pick your battles to decide what will be funded by medicare and what won't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3) Over time, a shift in emphasis is needed from sickness care to prevention. But one is not a substitute for the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4) Inefficiencies are a killer: Canada has one of the most expensive health systems in the world, and mediocre outcomes. It is estimated that one-quarter of all health spending is wasted through inefficiency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5) Public health insurance plans like OHIP should not pay for every service available; only for cost-effective treatments. Independent bodies like Health Quality Ontario can provide evidence-based advice on rationing based on results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6) Health-care delivery should be better co-ordinated. The way to do that in Ontario is to give LHINs (local health integration networks) the authority, resources and accountability to make patient journeys more seamless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">7) Pay more attention to the heaviest users: five per cent of patients account for almost 80 per cent of costs. If you manage their care, you manage costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8) Health professionals – physicians, in particular – should be paid for the quality of care, not only the quantity of services they provide. The system needs more incentives – and payments should be tied to outcomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9) The health system is designed to bring the patient to the practitioner, often in a hospital setting. Patient-centered care means bringing care to the people with home care and community-based clinics. But community care has to be a substitute for institutional care, not an add-on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10) The public-insurance model is sound. Creating a parallel private system might bring some efficiencies, but widespread privatization would distract politicians and the public and impede necessary reform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key between-the-lines message is to make the patient-taxpayer the priority and stop kowtowing to self-interested “stakeholders.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ontario Health Coalition, a largely union-funded group, warned grimly of “dramatic” cutbacks in the range of $3-billion to $4-billion, with hospital, home care and nursing homes bearing the brunt. The Ontario Medical Association, representing physicians, crowed it has already “helped find” $240-million in health-care savings and it is 100-per-cent supportive of efficiency improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's now up to the government to withstand the mock outrage and make changes that will improve care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Drummond will provide proposals that would pinch everyone a lot but savage no one. What we can expect is not the offering of the Grim Reaper out to destroy medicare but a level-headed functionary who wants it to flourish, albeit in a little more austere, less profligate fashion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the things most admirable about the game of golf is that cheaters do not prosper.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whereas in many other sports cheating is taught and getting away with it often applauded, golfers are expected to be their own stern and unforgiving officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weekend golfers who cheat are avoided; professional golfers who call their own penalties are widely admired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Playing fair is the one rule that matters most.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On that count, you have to have some sympathy for those Canadian Parliamentarians who think playing golf with a business associate should be treated the same as taking that business associate off to a hockey game. Bring back tax write-offs for greens fees, says the All Party Golf Caucus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The MPs' arguments in favour of 50-per-cent tax deductions – same as applies to corporate hockey, baseball, basketball and football tickets – are not without merit. Surely it is far easier to talk business on a golf course than in a hockey rink where bad music screams from one drop of the puck to the next. And a lot more Canadians play golf than hockey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's only fair, they say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty – a former hockey player while attending Princeton – has refused to entertain such a notion. And critics, who call such loopholes “boutique tax breaks,” are adamant that he never allow it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who don't golf, says Gregory Thomas, federal director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, would see it as “special treatment.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What he would rather see, if fairness is indeed the criterion, is for the government to “hunt down and eliminate sketchy tax breaks” – just as they did with those corporate greens fees 40 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ability for businesses of any size to write off a portion of ticket costs as legitimate entertainment expenses has had a profound effect on North American sports. No write-off, far fewer, if any, luxury boxes; no coveted revenue from luxury boxes, no push to build continuous state-of-the-art facilities; no need for better revenue-producing buildings, no demand for government subsidy to build these palaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The end effect is that many taxpayers end up paying for facilities that put on events they feel they cannot afford to attend. It can even be argued that tax write-offs and government subsidies have played a significant role in the skyrocketing of ticket prices to pay for player contracts that years ago left the realm of sense, let alone common sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas and his taxpayers' association have specifically targeted government subsidies going to new facilities for professional teams – “the worst tax ever invented,” he says – but he knows the battle is virtually futile. It's the way things are done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Various politicians in both the United States and Canada have talked about getting rid of the ticket tax break but, apart from reducing it somewhat, no one has ever eliminated what should never have been allowed in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Writing in The New York Times a couple of years ago, Duke University law professor Richard Schmalbeck and Jay Soled of Rutgers Business School argued that the U.S. government should move toward the elimination of the sports tax break – “essentially a huge, and wholly unnecessary, government subsidy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such write-offs, they argued, “are little more than an excuse for corporate executives to consume luxury items at a discount, distorting markets and cheating the public out of substantial tax revenue.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas would love to see the same applied in Canada. Get rid of all such breaks for the already well-off, he says, and everyone would benefit. Tax rates would come down, everyone would have more money and, significantly, people would still fill arenas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The world has become a lot more affluent,” he says. “I don't think we'd see six teams in the National Hockey League with the players having to take trains everywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's no question professional sports is a highly lucrative business, but it would still be so without those insane subsidies for buildings or allowing ticket write-offs.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas says there is no accessible breakdown of just what this has cost taxpayers. If the total were known, perhaps the public would demand action. But he does not expect any. For one thing, as professional teams overlap borders, the United States and Canada would have to work jointly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If they did not, and Canada acted unilaterally, teams feeling unduly punished would use the one trick that always seems to work: the threat of going elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If the government were seen to be coming out against NHL and CFL tickets,” he says, “the lobbying it would create would be an awesome spectacle.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would, however, be more fair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which, in golf, is the way a game should be played.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Give people enough line of credit and they'll hang themselves with debt.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bad boy of borrowing products – that's the line of credit. Recently, the federal government asked the banks to stop blithely handing out home-equity credit lines to people. In his new book The Wealthy Barber Returns, David Chilton writes that credit lines can be an excellent financial tool for disciplined people. “The other 71.9 per cent of Canadians, however, should be careful. Very careful.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debt is never more comfortable than it is with the line of credit because money is instantly accessible and the rules for paying it back are slack. You can't ignore a credit line, but you can stretch repayment out indefinitely. And then there's the rising interest rate risk. Lines of credit are floating rate debt, and that means you'll pay more every time rates edge higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some tips for managing a line of credit from Stephanie Holmes-Winton, who as president of The Money Finder trains financial advisers to address their clients' debt problems:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. If you're bad with debt, a line of credit won't save you</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Holmes-Winton says she used to advise people with high credit card debts to switch to a credit line where the interest rate is vastly lower. What she found was that these people simply went and ran up the credit line balances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I might as well have been blindfolding these people, spinning them in a circle, handing them a Skilsaw and then wondering why they cut their finger off,” Ms. Holmes-Winton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Your LOC is not an ATM</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Holmes-Winton has come across people who take out $100 here and there from their credit lines to help them make it through the week. That's called living beyond your means. You end up with an amorphous mass of debt racked up for purchases that brought only a moment's satisfaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Beware the LOC-dependent lifestyle</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having a permanent balance on your LOC is an admission that you can't afford your current level of spending. Even if the payments are affordable, they're burning up money that could be used for savings or other more productive purposes. “What I don't want people to do is get in the habit of paying $10,000 down on their line of credit, and then racking it back up again by $10,000,” Ms. Holmes-Winton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She sometimes suggests people take advantage of the comparatively low cost of a credit line to pay off debt at much higher interest rates (credit cards are the classic example). She says that 10 years is the maximum timeframe for getting this line of credit debt paid off. Smaller purchases, say $5,000 or less, should be paid back in 24 months or less, while 48 months is realistic for purchases in the $10,000 range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Turn your LOC into a loan</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-equity lines of credit often allow you to divide your borrowing into different chunks, or sub-accounts, Ms. Holmes-Winton said. To impose some discipline in repaying a line of credit debt, ask your lender to set up automatic monthly payments to a sub-account that combines both principal and interest. Set the payments so you'll have your debt paid down over a set period of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. Plan for higher interest rates</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit lines are priced off the prime rate, which today is 3 per cent. As recently as 2006-07, the prime sat around 6 per cent. That's the background for Ms. Holmes-Winton's suggestion that people estimate whether they can afford to carry the current balance on their LOC at double today's rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. Don't buy a car with your line of credit</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People with small credit lines may find that the cost of buying a car uses up too much of their borrowing room, Ms. Holmes-Winton said. Also, adding the car to a bunch of other debts on the credit line can slow the repayment process. “It's very easy for the lines to get blurry. We end up paying for these cars for 12 or 15 years and we can't even tell when we've fully paid for them.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">7. LOCs can be a lifesaver</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ideally, you won't buy things until you've saved enough money to pay cash, Ms. Holmes-Winton said. “That works with maybe a new sofa or redoing your bathroom for aesthetic reasons, but it's not the same reality as if you have a leak in your bathroom that you must fix.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In money emergencies like this, a LOC is the smart way to borrow. If you can handle it, that is.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is feeling blue when your spouse dies indicative of depression – or just part of the normal grieving process? It ought to be clear that distresses experienced by virtually everyone at one time or another are not mental illnesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A revision of an influential diagnostic manual plans to categorize a wide range of apparently everyday behaviours as mental health disorders, causing considerable controversy in the psychiatric community. This edition, known as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5, makes formal diagnoses for shyness and temper tantrums in children, premenstrual irritability; loneliness; Internet addiction; and neuro-cognitive loss in the elderly.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giving labels to behaviours and feelings that are simply part of the human condition may do more harm than good. There is a danger in viewing persistent insolence in six-year-olds, or a grandmother's forgetfulness, in such a light. Not every severe emotion is a sign of mental disturbance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manual is not, however, meant to be used in isolation. While diagnostic criteria are an important and influential guide, they are only one component in understanding a patient's experience. “The manual is not a cookbook to be used mechanically,” notes Dr. Susan Abbey, a past president of the Canadian Psychiatric Association. “You have to look at how impaired people are, and how much they are suffering.” Everyone reacts differently to stressful events such as the loss of a child, spouse or job. A good psychiatrist or psychologist assesses a patient over time to see whether their symptoms interfere with their ability to work and maintain relationships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manual, published by the American Psychiatric Association, may have more of a role to play in the U.S., where the private health-care system requires a diagnosis in order for the patient to receive treatment and qualify for reimbursement by his or her health insurer. It will be officially launched in May, 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, the APA should be congratulated for posting DSM-5 drafts on its website. Feedback from the mental health community, scientists and researchers can help to fine-tune it. While medicalizing ordinary distress is certainly not helpful, an updated manual that helps people in pain at a pathological level is welcome. The loss of a beloved, life-long partner may indeed trigger depression in some people, and the sooner they receive treatment, the better.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former radio talk-show host Christy Clark returned to the station she used as a springboard for her successful bid to become B.C. Premier, this time to reach out to a familiar audience now critical to her political future.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as Ms. Clark's path to this highest political office in the province was unconventional, so was her appearance on her old colleague Bill Good's top-rated morning show. Instead of dropping by to answer a few questions, she effectively delivered a throne speech that laid out her government's spring agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even by B.C. standards, where politicians have used radio shows for decades to make important announcements or to deal with high-profile scandals and controversies, Ms. Clark's appearance was unprecedented. In fact, the initial press release from her office last week suggested her 90-minute session at station CKNW would take the place of a throne speech.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When that word generated protests from the media and NDP Opposition, Ms. Clark's office issued a clarification; it would not be a throne speech in any form because the current sitting of the House has not been terminated. Throne speeches mark a new sitting of the legislature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the spring session of the legislature – which starts Tuesday – usually opens with a throne speech, and Ms. Clark's statement on Mr. Good's show sounded in many ways like something the Lieutenant-Governor might have read in the legislature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What it also sounded like was a politician desperate to move the political dial in B.C. For months now, polls have showed Ms. Clark's Liberals falling further back of their main rivals, the New Democrats. But the governing party, a coalition of liberal and conservative-minded voters, has also been hemorrhaging support to the resurgent BC Conservative Party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not a pretty place to be for Ms. Clark, especially given that her fiscal cupboards are bare. This was a point she took great pains to drive home on the radio; there's no money for raises for teachers or most of the other public-sector unions with which the government is currently bargaining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The B.C. Premier can only cast an envious eye towards her colleague, Alberta Premier Alison Redford, who just introduced a budget awash with the kind of expensive policies and programs that can be attractive to voters come election time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not so for Ms. Clark. As bad, she can't shake the harmful political legacy of her own party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is almost amusing to listen to the Premier now, a year into the job, throw her predecessor, Gordon Campbell, under the bus. Many of her current cabinet ministers were part of Mr. Campbell's inner circle and were staunch supporters of many of the policies she now routinely trashes. They must be thrilled to have their contribution to government recognized in such a way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One caller into the radio station on Monday complained about tolls that will be levied on a new bridge being built in Greater Vancouver. “I wasn't part of that decision. That was made by the previous administration,” she said. (A previous administration of which she was once part.) But asked if she would reverse the decision, the Premier said no: that the policy made sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With an election just over a year away, Ms. Clark is desperate for a political game changer. But finding it is harder than it might seem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In order to establish some cred with those right-leaning voters now leaning towards the BC Conservatives, she has to balance the budget by 2013-14. To do that, she has to shut off the government spending taps, which means slowing the flow of dollars into pet projects and exciting ventures that can translate into political support and positive media coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There wasn't much the Premier had to say in her turn on the radio Monday that quickened the pulse. The old Liberal saw about not wanting to return the province to the have-not 1990s when the NDP was in power sounded tired and desperate and like a leader with no new ideas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her best hope may be a fight with the province's public-sector unions over wage increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seems clear the government and the province's teachers will not find common ground on a new contract and that legislation will be needed to order them back to work when they inevitably go on strike. If that type of public-sector contract discontentment spreads to other sectors and other unions, Ms. Clark could find herself staring at a major political crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just the kind that can sometimes work in a government's favour.</p>

But when she asked if she should paint her walls linen white or vanilla ice-cream white, I told her it was time to consult an interior designer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After making the move from a one-bedroom condo to a home with four floors, she had questions but no plan.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those of us who opt for do-it-yourself design want to save money, but sometimes this approach ends up costing more. A professional can ensure we're making the best choices for our lifestyle, our home's resale value and our budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While fees range from $150 to $250 plus an hour, there are many talented young designers who are looking to build their portfolios and client base, and quote rates at a fraction of that price. The Interior Designers of Canada website is an excellent resource for designers at all stages of their career.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another option is to work with a junior designer at a well-known firm. My girlfriend chose this option and paid $85 an hour, for five hours in total. She also asked for a tiered pricing system, from “rolling up her sleeves” to “hands off,” so she could see what was offered at various price points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you want a hybrid of the two, a company like Good Space Design Group, based in Vancouver, is a smart option. It offers a less expensive alternative to a full-service design firm with its “design in a box” service. You receive fabric recommendations, a lighting plan and “paint-by-numbers” design instruction, all wrapped up in a pretty little package.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might also find designers in some of your favourite stores who will visit your home and provide suggestions. In some cases their consultation fee is waived if you purchase items from their store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The long-term value of professional guidance far outweighs the initial costs. Plus, you'll never have to second-guess linen versus vanilla ice cream for your walls.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘I'm neutral in this thing, Swiss all the way,” says affable MP Peter Stoffer of the NDP leadership battle. “But, to be frank, it's shaping up as Tom Mulcair's to lose. More and more people are looking at him as the guy who can tackle Stephen Harper.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nathan Cullen, one of seven remaining candidates, concurs. “I think, for sure, Tom is out front.” A popularity poll last week furthered that impression, giving the former Quebec cabinet minister a sizable margin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Running second, by rough estimates, is Peggy Nash, followed by Paul Dewar – who, while lacking in platform skills, has a strong organization – and Brian Topp. Mr. Cullen, showing more juice than the others, has dark horse status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mulcair's organizers – “our guy's a pro” – are enthused by the trend line but cognizant of the caveats. There's more than a month to go, and the tangled balloting system can lead to accidental outcomes. But there's something else. The fear, as one Mulcair strategist put it, that the two Big Labour candidates, Ms. Nash and Mr. Topp, join hands at the convention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a scenario many are talking about. Ms. Nash, a former negotiator with the Canadian Auto Workers union, has big support from that quarter. Mr. Topp, endorsed by the United Steelworkers, has that union going full tilt for him. These two candidates get along well, have broad backing and are compatible in their leftish leanings. To be considered as well is that union member support is more readily transferable than that of other delegates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you think of what candidates might be aligning,” Mr. Cullen says, “those are the two you would look to.” Yep, says Mr. Stoffer, Nash-Topp is “what I'm hearing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Watching closely is former party leader Ed Broadbent, a Topp supporter. “Steelworkers and auto workers,” he says, “do not always act in concert on union issues or in party settings. But it could well be the case here.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the Mulcair nightmare. A preconvention Nash-Topp deal could have a similar effect as the Gerard Kennedy-Stéphane Dion pact at the 2006 Liberal leadership convention, with one of the candidates serving as kingmaker to the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mulcair, it should be noted, has some strong union backing (United Food and Commercial Workers), as does Mr. Dewar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mulcairians are concerned about a high-profile role by Mr. Broadbent at the convention. While he recognizes Mr. Topp's handicap – zero experience as a retail politician – Mr. Broadbent thinks he's the better choice. He fears that Mr. Mulcair, whom some portray as hot and nasty, is not a team player, and he's trying to get out that message.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond Mr. Topp, who rivals suggest would make a good clerk of the Privy Council, it's Mr. Cullen's candidacy that's impressed Mr. Broadbent the most. The Mulcair camp is not displeased at Mr. Cullen's showing. As a counter to an alliance of the labour candidates, a Cullen-Mulcair convention coupling could materialize. “I like Tom a lot,” says Mr. Cullen, not discounting the possibility. The two men, linked strongly on environmental issues, have a more expansive vision of the party, believing it needs to cast a broader, more moderate net to achieve the goal of governance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like all other candidates, Mr. Mulcair parts company with the British Columbian on his modified-merger idea of having Liberals and New Democrats co-operate in some ridings against the Conservatives. Mr. Mulcair politely challenged Mr. Cullen on the issue in Sunday's debate in Quebec City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While they may be eventual allies, the debate saw Ms. Nash go after Mr. Topp for his lack of experience. It also saw a heady performance by MP Niki Ashton, although her campaign has failed to find momentum. And while Mr. Dewar continues to struggle in debates, his campaign has a poll showing that he leads all other candidates in the key category, given the balloting structure, of second preference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond Ms. Ashton and Nova Scotia pharmacist Martin Singh, all the candidates have a shot in a race that's likely to be determined by alliances. The seasoned Mr. Mulcair is the front-runner, but a Nash-Topp combination would be a formidable force to overcome.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I find Valentine's Day kind of cheesy. Is there any to make it more meaningful?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to all the fair-trade options for the flowers, chocolates and diamond earrings that are the material hallmarks of the day, we like to consider a broader context for the day of love. More than any day on the calendar, Feb. 14 creates a bitter division between two groups of Canadians: happily in love couples, and singles who would substitute “annoying” for “happily in love.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, this week, we thought we would attempt to find some common ground on Valentine's Day by answering a question on the lips of many of those single Canadians: Do we really need to dedicate a whole day to love?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer, we believe, is yes. But we're arguing for a day on which we all bring a bit more love to the world in general, especially those who need it most.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In our family, Feb. 14 is our Grandma Mimi's birthday. If it's at all possible, we visit her in Windsor, Ont., to bring flowers and take her to the hairdresser, or provide some other treat to show our love. This year is her 98th, and her first with her great-granddaughter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mimi's challenges with Alzheimer's have meant that for the past few years, our visits have been at her retirement home. It's a very nice spot with kind and dedicated staff, but still it can be a sad place. Several of the residents mistake us for their grandkids, and sigh when they learn we're not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mother Teresa once said the most terrible poverty in the world is loneliness. It's also said February is the loneliest month, in the midst of the dark Canadian winter and with a special day dedicated to extolling the wonders of coupledom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This isn't to be a downer on Valentine's Day; it's to spark a mini-movement to looking beyond romantic love. If you have it, awesome: Show your love to your dearest in the most creative and meaningful ways you can (ideally with less stuff and more love notes packed in lunches). But maybe we can each take a moment to “spread the love” by bringing some kindness and companionship to someone who needs it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We may know someone who has lost a loved one over the past year, for whom today is especially lonely. Family members, friends or neighbours who live alone may appreciate a phone call, a lunch date or a batch of muffins, just to know that they're noticed and cared for, that they're not alone. Even a simple smile and hello to someone you pass on the street would add warmth to a cold winter's day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If “living better” means sometimes leaving our comfort zone, then Valentine's Day is an opportunity to reach beyond our regular circles of love and to make someone's day by letting them know we're thinking of them.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On his very first day in office, Mayor Rob Ford declared that “the war on the car is over.” Can you imagine him bringing in a new gasoline tax to pay for transit? How about a parking levy? Expressway road tolls?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hard to get your mind around, isn't it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet a report presented to city council's executive committee on Monday makes it clear that the mayor will have to consider these measures and more if he is to have a chance of building his favourite transit project: a Sheppard subway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report by KPMG consultants was commissioned by Gordon Chong for his study promoting the project. It looks into the cost of extending the current, five-station Sheppard line eastward to the Scarborough city centre. The estimated cost for that leg is more than $2.7-billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As KPMG points out, the city should be able to count on $650-million from the provincial government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, at least, was the amount that Premier Dalton McGuinty agreed to set aside when he signed a transit agreement with Mr. Ford last March. An additional $333-million has been earmarked by the federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If things work out, that should give Mr. Ford a down payment of $983-million for the Sheppard line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KPMG reckons the city could get another $900-million from the intensified development along the Sheppard route that would result from the construction of a subway line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This would come from levying development charges, selling city-owned development rights and using tax-increment financing, a way of building community projects by raising money on the assumption of higher tax revenues in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics doubt that Sheppard would draw nearly enough new development to produce such a funding bonanza, but let's give project boosters the benefit of the doubt and assume that the city reaps the whole $900-million plus the $983-million from governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This still leaves the project about $900-million short under the traditional funding models (and about $700-million short under newer models, according to KPMG).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means turning to what the consultants call “other revenue tools.” By another of those ironies that seem to blossom in Mr. Ford's footprints, nearly all of them involve sticking it to his friend the beleaguered driver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congestion charges like they have in Stockholm or London could bring in up to $136-million a year. Expressway tolls could bring in up to $556-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto could follow the example of San Diego and Minneapolis and charge solo drivers for using high-occupancy vehicle, or HOV, lanes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or it could tax parking. San Francisco levies a 25 per cent tax on all commercial off-street parking and puts 40 per cent of the take into a transportation fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gasoline tax on British Columbia's south coast goes to funding transit as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consultants even suggest a vehicle registration tax – just like the one Mr. Ford killed weeks after taking office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While vehicle charges have recently been removed in the city,” KPMG says dryly, “this revenue tool remains a possible option for consideration.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ford has always refused even to think about taxing drivers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the Chong report presents him with a dilemma. He is eager to deliver on his promise of a Sheppard subway, but, to get it, he might have to open his mind to measures that run against his grain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to the real world, Your Worship.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around 30-billion mobile apps were downloaded globally in 2011. Of those, roughly 25 per cent were only used once and then discarded. With hundreds of thousands to choose from, it's hard to keep up. With that in mind, let's take a look at three money-saving mobile apps that might be more likely to stay on your phone.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OpenTable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The free OpenTable app allows you to make reservations at restaurants from your smartphone. By doing so, you accumulate points that can be exchanged for gift certificates valid at any of the many restaurants that use the OpenTable system. While a normal reservation earns you 100 points, restaurants looking to drum up business will periodically offer 1,000 point reservations. You can claim a $26 reward voucher with only 2,000 points, so you could just do a search for 1,000 point tables on the app, and after two visits you've earned yourself a main course at a mid-range restaurant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if you know a particular restaurant won't be busy and you won't require reservations, get into the habit of always making one on the app and you'll be racking up discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Navigation Apps</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With most smartphones these days incorporating all the guts that are required to make a GPS navigation system work, why bother buying a second set of guts? Instead of spending hundreds of dollars on hardware and periodic map updates, you can now buy an app that does the same things for a fraction of the price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While that's probably one of the most expensive apps you'll ever buy, you'll be saving hundreds of dollars – even after spending another $40 for a hands-free car adaptor kit so the screen is always in sight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've personally been using the TomTom app for the iPhone, which was $49.99 and includes maps for Canada and the U.S. With the TomTom app, you also have the option of live traffic updates in major cities for $2.99 per month or $19.99 per year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Honourable Mention: GasBuddy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another free app, it gives you real-time prices at the pumps which you can sort by cheapest price or closest location. I've been checking it every day and the spread for a five-kilometre radius from my house is about six cents per litre for regular grade gas.</p>

It is genuinely difficult for even the most clear-eyed and unromantic person not to acknowledge – and even benefit from – Valentine's Day. This occurs either through a collaborative disdain for the day that reaffirms a couple's values and, hence, their bond, or via the more usual route of love notes, fancy dinners and other gifts exchanged in the spirit of the day, with or without a knowing wink.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada has no business sending Leroy Smickle to a federal penitentiary for three years. Alone in a private home, the Toronto man was holding a loaded handgun that apparently didn't belong to him, and trying to take a photo of himself on a laptop. It's an unusual situation – life is funny that way. And that is why judges often need some manoeuvring room, and why mandatory minimum penalties may be deemed cruel and unusual punishment, as this one was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Criminal Code has 46 offences with mandatory minimum penalties, a good number of them put there by the Conservative government. Some make sense, like the mandatory life sentence with no parole for 25 years for first-degree murder. But sometimes the real point seems to be to declare that judges can't be trusted to protect Canadians. And justice may get lost.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Smickle had no criminal record when he was charged at 27. He has a full-time job as a cleaner, and a family. He chose not to go out to a club with his cousin, the judge said, because he had to be up for work the next day. Alone, he did a stupid thing by picking up that gun. At the same moment, the police showed up with a search warrant to look for guns in his cousin's home, and broke down the door. He immediately dropped the gun and laptop. That he was not shot and killed by police verges on the miraculous, and is a credit to the police.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The penitentiary is no place for Mr. Smickle. He acted stupidly, as Madam Justice Anne Molloy of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice wrote, but he is not in need of rehabilitation. The only purpose federal jail time would serve would be to school him in criminal matters, and sever him from his job and family. As Judge Molloy said, three years is “grossly disproportionate,” and therefore cruel and unusual punishment under the Charter of Rights. Canada could send a message and still allow for exceptional cases to be exempt from the obligatory minimums, as England and Wales do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parliament has every right to set parameters for sentencing and to try to ensure that a strong message of deterrence is sent to those who have guns. (A previous Liberal government had adopted a one-year minimum in 1998.) But mandatory minimums can put such strict constraints on judicial discretion that they create injustices. In this case, the ends did not justify the means, and Judge Molloy was right to say so.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A revision of an influential diagnostic manual plans to categorize a wide range of apparently everyday behaviours as mental health disorders, causing considerable controversy in the psychiatric community.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– Globe editorial, Feb. 14</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sensitive to such criticism, the American Psychiatric Association is reviewing the latest draft of its fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders with an eye to deleting the following proposed psychological ailments:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existential Angst is a relatively common disorder typically manifesting itself in teenagers, philosophy majors and Scandinavian filmmakers. Researchers asked test subjects three key questions: (1) Have you sometimes wondered about the meaning of life? (2) Have you experienced sadness contemplating the ultimate futility of human existence?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(3) Did you ever wonder why we're here? Those answering “yes” to two or more of these questions were identified as sufferers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pharmaceutical companies are reportedly working on a medication. Most test subjects taking a moderate dose of Apathene reported that, instead of needless worry about pointless metaphysical and ethical questions, they felt what one subject described as “the pleasant warmth of apathy.” To date, the only observed side effects are persistent disinterest and intellectual stultification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Workplace Disinterest is marked by a series of clearly defined symptoms that include on-the-job napping, excessive clock watching, recurrent tardiness and incessant retirement planning. Although difficult to believe that work isn't always a stimulating, life-affirming experience, those afflicted spend their work days waiting only for them to end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, there was little hope for these people. But if this disorder is recognized, health insurance coverage may soon be available to millions of sufferers. If nothing else, ongoing psychotherapy will afford these poor individuals a few extra hours a week away from their workplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pollyannaish Posturing is marked by an inability to see the dark side of anything. No matter how grey the day or bleak the circumstances, those afflicted will insist on seeing the sunny side of any situation. To these sad individuals, every cloud has a silver lining and every glass is at least half full. These poor folks are often saddled with accompanying physical ailments such as sore facial muscles from incessant smiling and repeated bruising inflicted by those they've repeatedly urged to “look on the bright side” or “put on a happy face.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pointless Social Chatter is so common that it's likely that someone in your family or social circle suffers from this annoying condition. If you're subjected to the trivial conversational ramblings of someone close to you, it's likely the person in question is such a sufferer. It's hoped that extensive talk therapy can help alleviate the symptoms. At the very least, the hours spent in psychotherapy are hours that others won't be subjected to the inanities spouted by these individuals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dysapologia is thought to be a neuro-chemical ailment marked by an inability to apologize for sleights, injuries, oversights or mistakes. This disorder usually manifests itself through a long-standing failure to say “I'm sorry” in obvious situations of fault, and is more prevalent among politicians, media personalities and recalcitrant three-year-olds. So far, it has been highly resistant to psychotherapy or medication. To date, the only known cure has been maturity or electoral defeat.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The important thing about what's happening in Syria is that so many things are happening simultaneously. The sheer number and weight of various diplomatic initiatives now in play indicate that politics, rather than fighting on the ground, will determine the outcome of what is a low-intensity civil war. This is the preferred situation, because an all-out military battle would see death and destruction without necessarily ending the standoff between government and opposition.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dynamic diplomatic front that's been activated offers a range of options that could bring about an eventual resolution of the conflict in Syria, probably – but not certainly – with a change in both the al-Assad family leadership and the top-heavy authoritarian state system. The collapse of efforts to press Syria at the United Nations Security Council, due to the Russian-Chinese veto, seems only to have enhanced the resolve of many Arab governments to explore other means to end the killings and perhaps move the country to a more representative and democratic system of government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest Arab League and Gulf Co-operation Council meetings in Cairo have triggered a flurry of diplomatic and bilateral political activity that's striking for the variety of its channels and actors. Three parallel tracks now seem to be operational.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The UN General Assembly debate, including the harsh verdict against the Syrian government's actions by the UN Human Rights Council, serves to reveal a significant international desire to press Damascus to change its policy toward the mostly non-violent demonstrators. Simultaneously, the Arab League has proposed forming a joint Arab-UN peacekeeping force to stabilize the situation inside Syria, and appointing a UN-Arab League special envoy to Syria. The UN-Arab League combination is likely to have more clout than either organization on its own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Friends of Syria group of countries, set to meet in Tunisia on Feb. 24, will explore ways to press all sides in Syria to shift onto a political track to resolve the conflict. This could provide the mechanism for “legitimate” collective international action that was blocked by the Security Council vetoes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bilateral moves by Arab countries could open the way for other countries to join in. These moves include withdrawing ambassadors from Damascus and expelling Syrian ambassadors, increasing contacts with the various Syrian opposition groups, and giving the opposition political and matériel assistance (presumably Band-Aids as well as bazookas).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's most intriguing is that the four pivotal diplomatic players in these dynamics seem to be Russia, Turkey, Iran and Saudi Arabia, with Tunisia, Qatar and the Arab League all playing important roles. The United States looms large in the background, and the Europeans are a diplomatic tale still being written.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three-track level of activity, with numerous bilateral meetings going on alongside multilateral actions, suggests that new forms of pressure will continue to be applied to the rulers in Damascus, with obvious goals in mind: eroding the regime's economic base, and strengthening the capacity of the non-violent demonstrators to persist and of the armed opposition to strike around the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ultimate aims would be to demoralize the overstretched armed forces (look for more one-off attacks against them), enhance the credibility and legitimacy of a more unified opposition movement, and cause the Russians to see the futility of supporting a doomed regime, thereby hastening the shift to a political transition and a post-al-Assad Syria. The al-Assad family and their co-rulers will never go along with such a transition, unless they find themselves totally isolated domestically, regionally and globally – which is the aim of the three-pronged strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key variable in all this is the capacity of the Syrian people to withstand for many more months the pain and deaths they now suffer on a daily basis. If the government repeats its brutal Homs assault simultaneously in a dozen cities across the country, the opposition could be literally crushed. The trajectory of the past 10 months suggests otherwise, as regime attacks have only escalated the opposition's scope and determination to resist, with a steady increase in Arab and international support for the opposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the government lowers the intensity of its attacks and sieges of opposition areas, the Arab and international community would probably lose some of its enthusiasm to keep pressing for change. We'll have answers to these questions by early summer, with diplomatic and economic levers now looming as the critical dynamics to watch.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEPPI'S PICKS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Italy's wine bounty offers a journey of virtually endless discovery, too. The country grows thousands of grape varieties, far more than any other. A fresh tug of acidity is a hallmark of most Italian wines, the key to their affinity with the vibrant cuisine. Just about any Italian white would mesh with the salad, but I'd specifically suggest something from the central region of Campania, home of the finest buffalo mozzarella, such as greco di tufo or fiano di Avellino. But if you prefer to go local, a zesty Canadian riesling would harmonize well, too. For the duck, try a fruity valpolicella ripasso or razor-sharp barbera. Sweet vin santo or passito di Pantelleria add a complementary raisin-like character to the polenta crunch.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manchego. Roquefort. Pecorino. Feta. These vastly different cheeses from different countries have one thing in common – they're all made with sheep's milk. They're also well-known names commonly brought home from the cheese counter, perhaps under the assumption they originate from cows. Sheep's milk remains something of a mystery, unlike goat's milk, which more clearly differentiates itself with its tangy, lemony freshness.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ewe's milk cheeses offer subtle yet complex flavours that remain mellow and sweet while managing to sidestep a simple, one-note experience. Firm sheep's milk cheeses develop nutty, caramel notes that become piquant and more intense as they age. Ewe's milk is more aromatic than cow milk and you may even detect the aroma of lanolin (the natural oil found in sheep's wool).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Elisabeth Bzikot, co-owner of Best Baa Dairy in Fergus, Ont., the hallmark of sheep's milk is its creamy aftertaste. Sheep's milk has a higher fat content than goat or cow. Ms. Bzikot, who takes sheep's milk with her coffee, finds it acts more like light cream. In a cheese it creates a buttery mouthfeel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Though it's a very rich milk, it goes down easily and is easily digested, “ she says. “There's no heaviness.” Many customers who are sensitive to cow's milk have made the switch to ewe's milk cheese and yogurt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stephanie Clark, an associate professor in the department of food and science and human nutrition at Iowa State University, explains that though the proteins in cow, sheep and goat milk are similar, the chains of amino acids making up the proteins will vary. If you have negative reactions to the protein in cow's milk, it's possible that goat's or sheep's milk protein could differ enough that your body may not see it as an invader. (She does emphasize that lactose does not vary in species, so switching milks is not a solution for people who are lactose intolerant).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this talk about richness and fat doesn't mean you have to avoid sheep's milk cheese for fear of diet sabotage. Ruth Klahsen of Monforte Dairy explains, “the cheese doesn't end up fattier or higher in fat than cow or goat milk cheese, you're just able to produce more volume of cheese from sheep milk than from the same amount of cow or goat milk.” Its yield is about double that of cow or goat due to the higher composition of fat and protein in ewe's milk (though sheep produce less milk overall).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Ms. Bzikot and Ms. Klahsen say they've converted many a wary customer to ewe's milk cheese. “We do have something called the ‘sheep milk shudder' where people who have decided they don't like goat milk cheese, then think of sheep milk as even stronger,” says Ms. Klahsen. “You have to get it into their mouth with a ‘I double dare you.' ” She stresses that the richness and subtlety of the cheese depends on the quality of the milk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Firm, aged sheep milk cheeses are always on my top 10 list. Aged Manchego from Spain, France's Ossau-Iraty (my eye-opener to the potential flavours in sheep milk), Quebec's Allegretto or Ontario's Toscano all display the sweet complexity of great sheep's milk cheese.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If I may assign a little bit of homework, an easy way of comparing sheep's milk to cow or goat is to purchase feta made from each type of milk. Both Monforte and Best Baa make their own, and many grocery stores carry different styles, especially in Greek neighbourhoods. Yogurt makes for another good project, but once you've have the naturally thick and creamy sheep's milk version there's no going back. Don't say I didn't warn you.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘I'm a Blue Jacket right now. … As of right now, I'm a Blue Jacket,” was how Rick Nash assessed his status Tuesday, as the NHL went berserk over the possibility that the former Canadian Olympian might be on the block with the NHL trade deadline less than two weeks.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And berserk may be an understatement, given how rarely players of Nash's age, 27, and pedigree become available, and how speculation got completely out of control when no one in a position of authority in the Columbus organization raced to get in front of a microphone and tell anyone differently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the key questions: Where might Nash be going; what would it take to get him; and most important of all, how much is he really worth?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One NHL general manager suggested a close examination of Nash's record in Columbus would be a worthwhile exercise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In eight full NHL seasons, Nash has produced 39, 57, 54, 57, 69, 79, 67 and 66 points, respectively. For the mathematically challenged, that's one year out of eight in which he has scored 70 or more points. Nash has never managed 80 points in a single NHL season, and after scoring 41 goals in 2004 to tie Jarome Iginla and Ilya Kovalchuk for the NHL scoring lead, he has got to 40 goals just once since then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strictly from the statistical side of the equation, Nash has been a very good, but not an exceptional NHL player.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What makes him so intriguing is his amazing one-on-one skill set. Every year, one or two of his goals makes the season-ending highlight reels, because Nash can dangle with the best of them, and when he gets it going, with his long reach, and incredible balance, he can make a defence look utterly foolish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with Iginla in Calgary, there is a long-standing view that if Nash ever hooked up with the right playmaking centre, then look out. The sky would be the limit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's why Columbus general manager Scott Howson worked so hard last June to pry Jeff Carter away from the Philadelphia Flyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The thinking was that Carter and Nash would develop instant chemistry and form two thirds of a dynamic top line, something Columbus didn't have when Derick Brassard or Antoine Vermette or Gil Brule or Nik Zherdev or any number of other centres who passed through never did find the right fit with Nash. But it didn't work with Carter either, who is more of a finisher than a puck distributor anyway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carter's difficulties adjusting to Columbus have been well-documented, and the feeling is he will be on the move between now and the 27th if the Blue Jackets can interest a team in a $58-million contract that has 10 years to run after this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nash is on a pretty big ticket too – a $7.8-million annual cap hit, a total commitment of $62.4-million over eight years. When he signed the deal originally, it was thought that he would be a Blue Jacket for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, it looks as though that marriage is on the rocks, too, and the conclusion internally in Columbus (which has been by far the worst team in the NHL this season) is that it needs a significant remake because what the Jackets have isn't working and maybe it's time for a facelift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Logically, given how Steve Mason has struggled, the primary suitor for Nash needs to include a hot goaltending prospect as part of the package. Vancouver has that in Cory Schneider, but the Canucks do not want to move Schneider just yet, liking the dynamic between him and Roberto Luongo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Los Angeles Kings have the next best goaltending option, Jonathan Bernier, who is languishing on the bench behind Jonathan Quick, but is highly prized for his potential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only problem with Bernier is teams haven't seen enough of him this year, or ever in the NHL, to determine if he's the real deal. So if Bernier is part of a package, then that would require a leap of faith on the part of Columbus. But until they sent Slava Voynov to the minors, the Kings had been carrying eight defencemen, so they are in a position to include a quality piece, say a Jack Johnson, in the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any event, deals of this magnitude generally take time and if Nash is on the market, Howson knows that the trick is going to be to engage multiple teams in a bidding war to see just how high they might go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For someone of Nash's stature, it might be stratospheric by the time all is said and done.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a tour of the province in 2008, B.C. ombudsman Kim Carter encountered a frustrated, angry and often scared faction of the population: seniors living in residential care.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shocking numbers of those appealing for her help prompted Ms. Carter to launch a fulsome investigation into the system that was spawning the complaints. On Tuesday, the most extensive – and disturbing – examination of the state of seniors' care in the province landed in the B.C. Legislature with the kind of thud that often portends trouble for a sitting government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years in the making and more than 400 pages in length, the report is an often uncomplimentary indictment of efforts by the Liberal government to address issues that have been known about and discussed for years. In fact, two years before Ms. Carter launched her probe, the government had received a similarly themed report from a blue-ribbon council on aging and seniors' care that made several recommendations that the ombudsman would revisit in her review.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To that extent, it's not that the ombudsman's findings will strike a person as terribly revelatory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they are certain to incite head-shaking among a citizenry that has heard the B.C. government say before that is addressing age-old problems among the province's old agers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, there remains no minimum standard of care in many facilities, it seems. On that front, Ms. Carter's report is loaded with anecdotal evidence: residential home beds soaked in urine; feces caked on bed railings; residents agreeing to go to bed at 4 o'clock in the afternoon because of a shortage of staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly not enough is being done to crack down on homes that continue to offer what would charitably be described as sub-standard care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Carter's report includes 176 recommendations, many of which the government said on Tuesday it would be implementing. However, the ombudsman let it be known she was disappointed the government wasn't going far enough with many of her suggestions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the areas the government's watchdog is demanding action on are:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• An internet venue from which seniors can navigate the home and community care system. Among the information that seniors should be able to access is space availability at residences around the province as well as important background information on the homes;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Consistent reporting and tracking of elder abuse and neglect;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• The protection from retaliatory action for seniors who complain in good faith about the home and community care services they receive;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Objective and enforceable standards of care for home support services. This would include legally binding minimum requirements for assisted-living residences on staffing, residents' rights, food safety and nutrition, emergencies and record management;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Ensuring equal treatment, benefits and protection of seniors in residential care by establishing one legislative framework that applies to all residential care facilities instead of the two that currently exist;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Enhancing dementia and end-of-life care services in residential care;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Helping seniors stay in their homes by assessing the adequacy of current support programs and analyzing the benefits and costs of expanding those services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As we say, many of these recommendations have been made before, either formally or informally by people inside and outside the seniors' health care system. And while the B.C. government should be applauded for many moves it has made over the years to help an increasingly vulnerable part of the population, it clearly has not done enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it is not a good sign that the ombudsman, who gave her report to the government some time ago to consider, already seems discouraged by the Health Ministry's response to many of her recommendations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. has 22,000 people in residential care. Ninety-five per cent are 65 years or older – 52 per cent are past the age of 85. The number in residential care is only going to increase as the baby boomers get older and require greater care.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're trying to control your weight, frequent restaurant meals are usually the first to be banished. A wise decision, since many restaurants serve up high-calorie foods in large portions. Consider that a typical steak dinner – with the works – has 1,000-plus calories and a plate of seafood pasta can deliver as many as 1,200 calories (before the bread!). Even an entrée salad with chicken can have 800 calories or more.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, many studies have shown that people who eat out often consume more calories and fat and carry more body fat than those who routinely eat meals prepared at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But according to a recent study published in the Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior, frequent restaurant eating doesn't have to make you gain weight. The results suggest it's possible to eat out and, believe it or not, even lose a few pounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the study, researchers from the University of Texas at Austin enrolled 35 healthy perimenopausal women, aged 40 to 59, who ate out at least three times a week. Nineteen were placed in a six-week program called Mindful Restaurant Eating that helps develop skills to reduce calorie and fat intake when dining out. The remaining 16 women did not participate in the program and served as the control group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women in the prevention group attended six weekly, two-hour sessions. Each session included discussions on managing weight, weekly goals, eating-out strategies and mindful eating meditation. That mediation involved exercises aimed at becoming aware of hunger and satiety and helping appreciate the sight, smell and texture of food in order to increase satisfaction with smaller portions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The focus was not on losing weight but rather preventing weight gain, an important goal for women during the perimenopausal years when extra weight tends to accumulate around the abdomen, increasing the risk of heart disease and Type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, women enrolled in the Mindful Restaurant Eating program lost an average of 3.7 pounds and 1.2 inches from their waists after six weeks. There was no change in body weight or waist circumference among women in the control group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of times each week women ate out in restaurants did not change, indicating they were successfully able to manage their weight while continuing their usual, frequent eating-out patterns. Women who completed the program reduced their daily intake by 297 calories, about half accounted for during eating out. Fewer calories were also eaten at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bottom line: With a series of strategies, it is possible to control and manage what and how much you eat in restaurants. But without a game plan, it's easy to eat more – and gain weight – without intending to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Start by doing your homework. Many restaurants post nutrition numbers and other healthy eating tips on their websites. It's useful information that can help you decide what to order.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm willing to bet if you knew in advance that the Keg's Crème Brulée packs in 825 calories, you'd resist the temptation. Knowing that <span class="companylink">Swiss Chalet</span>'s full rack of BBQ ribs has 1,300 calories – and 900 milligrams of sodium – might prompt you to order a half rack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be assertive when dining out. If you don't know what's in a dish or don't know the serving size, ask. The following tips will help you make healthier choices in restaurants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To cut fat, especially saturated fat</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• When ordering grilled meat, fish or chicken, ask that it be grilled without butter or oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Choose tomato-based pasta dishes rather than creamy ones. Alfredo and rosé sauces are made with whipping cream, which delivers a hefty amount of saturated fat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Stick with broth-based soups instead of cream-based soups and chowders. To increase your intake of fibre-rich legumes, choose minestrone, lentil and bean soups most often.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Order sandwiches made with whole grain bread instead of white bread or high-fat croissants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Order steamed vegetables, green salad, or steamed brown rice instead of French fries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Ask for salsa with a baked potato instead of butter, sour cream, cheese or bacon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Watch out for healthy-sounding salads. Entrée salads laden with cheese, bacon and plenty of dressing can have more fat and calories than an all-dressed burger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Request lower-fat items even if they're not on the menu – fat-reduced salad dressings, salsa for a baked potato, or berries for dessert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To reduce sodium</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Stay clear of menu items described as pickled, marinated, smoked, barbequed, smothered (in sauce), teriyaki, soy sauce, broth, miso, gravy, bacon, and of course, salted or salty. These words indicate higher sodium meals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Order dressings, gravies and condiments on the side. Salad dressings, barbecue sauce, ketchup, mustard and pickles can add considerably to the sodium content of a meal. Request them separate from your meal and use them sparingly. You'll save calories too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• If ordering pizza, skip the processed meat toppings and order half the usual amount of cheese.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Request your meal to be prepared without added salt, MSG or sodium-containing ingredients such as soy sauce and broths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To slim down portion size</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Ask that half your meal be boxed up “to go” before you start eating. If you leave it sitting on your plate you'll be more likely to eat it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Order two appetizers, or an appetizer and a side salad, instead of a large entrée. Consider sharing an entrée.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Cut down on starchy side dishes. Skip the bread if the meal comes with rice, potato or pasta. Ask for extra vegetables instead of potatoes or rice. Order a half-portion of pasta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Slow your pace. After every bite, put down your knife and fork and chew your food thoroughly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Stop eating when you feel satisfied, not full. It takes 20 minutes for your brain to get the signal that your stomach has had enough food.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TORONTO -- jblair@globeandmail.com</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let the game's tall foreheads figure out how Carmelo Anthony is going to fit in with Jeremy Lin on the New York Knicks. The rest of us are just going to enjoy this ride. We're going to suspend our cynicism, much like that game-winning three-pointer hung in the air Tuesday night.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do you believe the Toronto Raptors? Four missed free throws in the fourth quarter. Eight turnovers and still he made the clutch shot, with Lin:Lin-Lin left in regulation time. Lin earned the right to win that game with a ballsy drive to the hoop to make the score 87-86 then tie it with a free-throw. He was mugged on the way to the hoop. Crushed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's one thing to play in the pretty areas and collect your points but that is not Jeremy Lin. He is tough. He is street, for a Knicks team and a city that knows a point guard – and all you had to do was watch the Knicks on the bench as he hopped toward them after his shot. A little smug. A little cocky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the city that booed Bobby Orr, so it's no surprise that early in the second quarter, after he'd been nearly run off the court in the first quarter by his Raptors counterpart Jose Calderon, Lin started to hear boos every time he touched the ball. It was a strange twist, since Lin was greeted by an almost explosive ovation when the starting lineups were introduced. It really did seem as though the signs that read Val-Lin's-Tine Day were indeed true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I swear it seemed like they were all cheering at the end. Every last 20,092 of them at the Air Canada Centre. Linsanity? Shoot – sign me up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With (Little) Steven Van Zandt of E Street Band fame looking on from Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd. chairman Larry Tanenbaum's left, Calderon responded with 12 first-quarter points, his biggest quarter since Jan. 15, 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lin had nine points in the first half and five of the Knicks' 11 turnovers – even Anthony Carter picked his pocket – but became more engaged in the third, but he showed a flash of anger with two minutes left, when the Knicks were sloppy in transition defence, allowing DeMar DeRozan a clear path to the hoop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lin's brow was furrowed and he yelled as he slammed the ball toward the official when the Knicks called a time out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, he took over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Go ahead. You doubt him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is true it will take work for Lin and Anthony to co-exist when Anthony returns from a strained groin injury but that's why the basketball gods created coaches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That will be the real test (Amar'e Stoudemire was back Tuesday, but his experience with Steve Nash in Phoenix would seem to suggest he'll make a seamless transition to Linsanity), as will Stoudemire and Anthony working alongside Chandler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My guess is that's the thing to worry about if you're the Knicks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lin? He'll be fine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Raptors worked out Lin on two occasions before the draft. Lin was waived twice this season, but on each occasion the Raptors had 15 players – including three point guards – on their roster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Raptors were impressed with Lin's toughness and head coach Dwane Casey spoke positively about his poise and athleticism when he coached Lin with the Dallas Mavericks' Summer League team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That 1-on-1 play is real,” Casey reiterated before the game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Casey is a smart man.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lin has had an impact on the Knicks' bottom line, according to Mark Ozanian, executive editor of Forbes.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Television ratings have gone up 66 per cent over last season – and that's particularly important since the MSG Network and <span class="companylink">Time-Warner Cable</span> are involved in a dispute over MSG's demand for a 53-per-cent increase in fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Ozanian believes the value of an Asian-American star is self-explanatory, he isn't certain the NBA head office will develop a marketing plan around him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don't know if it has to, with social media the way it is now,” he said, noting that on the morning of Super Bowl Sunday, Lin was a trending topic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He likely is this morning, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He's a marked man,” New York head coach Mike D'Antoni said afterward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course he is: he's the point guard for the New York Knicks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sounds about right, no?</p>
