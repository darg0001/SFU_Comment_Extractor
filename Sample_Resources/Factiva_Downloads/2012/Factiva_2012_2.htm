</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My doctor charges $125 for my annual checkup. I have no health problems. Does she have to charge this fee or is it at her discretion? Is this even legal in British Columbia?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of the annual physical has sparked considerable debate in the medical community. It seems silly to test reflexes and listen to chests of healthy patients. But without one, some argue, those at risk for cancer and other diseases may be missed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is no good evidence that a screening annual health examination improves people's health,” said Danielle Martin, board chair of Canadian Doctors for Medicare, and a family physician at Women's College Hospital in Toronto. “Most engage in this practice but there's no medical evidence to support it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, she does see some value in it. They are a good way to remind patients they require a mammogram or to test for blood glucose – something that is difficult during a shorter appointment. Having a physical every year, however, may be overdoing it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Annual physicals on patients with no symptoms are covered in Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Quebec, Prince Edward Island, Ontario and the Northwest Territories. Nunavut funds them for kids under 10 and adults 65 and older; the Yukon pays for a “well-woman” checkup (which typically includes a pap smear and breast exam). New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Nova Scotia do not cover them in symptomless patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In British Columbia, unless the doctor has a reason for doing the examination, it's not considered medically necessary, according to Ryan Jabs, the B.C. health ministry spokesman, who says it's been that way for a long time. So yes, it is legal for your doctor to bill you for the physical. If she didn't bill you for the service, she wouldn't be paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I do see why governments would want to scrap the annual physical – it costs boatloads of money and does not deliver measurable health benefits. Doctors in Ontario are paid $77.20 for the visit, which typically lasts about 25 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's outdated to have a review of every system of the body,” said Cleo Mavriplis, an assistant professor of family medicine at University of Ottawa. “Examining someone when they are healthy is very low yield.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Young, healthy men, she pointed out, need blood-pressure checks and preventive counselling for sexually transmitted diseases – but not every year. Young women require pap smears; those in childbearing years require counselling to take folic acid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Replacing the annual physical with a preventive health exam makes a lot of sense. Such an exam, done every year or two in older patients – less in younger patients – could catch those who require screening, including mammograms, cholesterol and colonoscopies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would also give doctors a chance to counsel patients on exercise and healthy eating, instead of performing useless exams on healthy bodies.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forget the expensive bauble he gave you over the holidays. And it's not about the trip your wife promised. Nor is it a matter of who wears the pants in the family.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The secret to marital happiness is as simple as making your spouse tea in the morning. Turning down his side of the bed. Giving her a back rub. Small acts of kindness are not just what we should be practising in the world at large, it would seem, but also right in our homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The generous marriage has a much greater chance of being a happy one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the finding of a recent study by the University of Virginia's National Marriage Project, examining the role of generosity in marriages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Defined as “the virtue of giving good things to one's spouse freely and abundantly,” such thoughtfulness adds a new dimension to our understanding of how couples can build a strong, stable partnership, say the researchers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their questions were directed in three areas. Did spouses offer small kindnesses to each other? Did they regularly express affection? Were they able to forgive? The researchers claim that this is the first empirical study of generosity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A happy marriage is not just about satisfying sex, in other words. (Although, of course, it's about that, too.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, sexual satisfaction came first as the factor that cements a partnership, followed by a sense of commitment. Generosity was third. Other factors include a positive attitude about raising children, social support from friends and family and spirituality within marriage. All 2,870 couples studied had children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undertaken in co-operation with the Center for Marriage and Families at the Institute for American Values, an organization headed up by Elizabeth Marquardt, a famously pro-marriage family scholar who argued in her book, Between Two Worlds: The Inner Lives of Children of Divorce, that even amicable divorces profoundly shape the lives of children in negative ways, the study set out to counter what it calls “the increasingly individualistic tenor of modern life.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that way, the study can be seen as another backlash against the popular divorce culture, not unlike books such as Mark O'Connell's The Marriage Benefit: The Surprising Rewards of Staying Together and Maggie Scarf's September Songs: The Good News about Marriage in the Later Years which criticized the consumerist attitude in modern marriage – the idea that if a partner no longer pleases you as he did when you first acquired him, you promptly trade him in for a different model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Since the 1970s and the advent of the Me Generation in North America, there's been a stress on seeing marriages as a vehicle for fulfilling individual needs as opposed to (at least in part) an opportunity to serve your spouse on a regular basis, something that is good for both you and your partner,” comments W. Bradford Wilcox, associate professor of sociology at the University of Virginia. As marriage came under scrutiny in the wake of feminism, the focus of most academic study was on issues of gender equality, he notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet the Holy Grail of the equitable marriage is far trickier to find than a hot cup of tea for your beloved. Among those parents with high scores on the generosity scale, 50 per cent reported their marriage as “very happy.” Among those with lower generosity scores, only 14 per cent claimed to be “very happy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's signalling to someone that you want to go above and beyond the call of duty. On a regular basis, it's signalling that you value them,” says Prof. Wilcox. “It's really little acts of service that don't cost a huge amount.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Feeling appreciated goes a long way to making someone feel good, even if he does have to clean up the kitchen every night. But it's not about positive reinforcement, the researchers quickly point out. “Generosity is often motivated by a desire to benefit one's spouse, not to receive reciprocal benefits,” they write in the study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A generous marriage makes both the giver and the receiver happy. Kind acts help engender a sense of gratitude, which research shows is linked to positive feelings. And the giver benefits from the altruism, another important factor in studies of well-being.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may seem self-evident – a basic part of being human. But generosity toward loved ones or even friends is often overlooked these days. “Part of it is that people are very busy,” Prof. Wilcox says in a telephone interview. “They're on their <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page or watching TV, and there's little free time to devote attention elsewhere.” It may also be a function of the child-focused family model, in which helicopter parents spend more time devoted to nurturing their children's talents and interests than they do cultivating their marriage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All marriages are opaque, but this study parts the curtain a little bit on those private, domestic behaviours that make partnerships strong. It's a welcome respite from the popular pastime of cooing over celebrity marriages, seemingly made in heaven, as a couple canoodles on the red carpet only weeks, or even days, before announcing their split.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a culture we underrate the importance of kindness in our romantic relationships. We think it's about how “hot” someone is, what kind of car they drive or what someone does for a living. We are enamoured of the grand gesture – being whisked away on a Caribbean holiday at short notice. But the study shows it's not the big displays of affection but rather the small, frequent, even mundane, ones that matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which reminds me of something Helen Gurley Brown, the former editor of Cosmopolitan, once said to me in an interview. “Forget the charmer,” she advised, wagging a finely manicured finger. “Go for the man who is your best friend.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's easy to make a bad argument against the Harper government's plan to establish an Office of Religious Freedom within the Department of Foreign Affairs. You grumble that religion has often been oppressive, and thunder that Canada as a secular state ought not pursue religious objectives. Eventually, you subside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These objections miss the point. Worse, they actually make the point – in favour of the office's establishment. Yes, religion has not only been oppressive in the past but, in many places in the world, still is. And yes, Canada is a secular state, meaning that it is of no religion and enforces none.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first point underscores the ongoing need for the promotion of religious freedom. The second confirms the appropriateness of a country such as Canada undertaking it. A beacon of religious freedom itself, it thereby expresses its concern that other countries share this blessing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a lot of careless invocation these days of “separation of church and state.” This isn't a Canadian doctrine, and is only very dubiously an American one. (In recent years, U.S. courts and scholars have offered a more nuanced view of permissible co-operation between the state and faith-based organizations to achieve legitimate secular ends such as education and social welfare.) Even if you adopt this term as your mantra, however, it doesn't preclude a public stand on behalf of religious freedom. On the contrary, it implies one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Religious freedom is precisely what the secular state was invented to secure. To the great philosopher John Locke (1632-1704) and the Enlightenment thinkers who followed him, religion could be free of coercion by the state only if the state was freed of coercion by religion. Instead of there being an official or established church whose bidding the state was obliged to do by suppressing or otherwise disadvantaging rival churches, religion would be disestablished. The state would go its way, and the churches theirs. Never again would any church get the state to do its dirty work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But nor would any church be permitted to recruit anyone else to its dirty work, either. There remained one crucial function for the state to perform within the realm of religion. In undertaking it, however, it acted in its secular capacity rather than in a religious one. That task was precisely to enforce freedom of religion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freedom of religion is not religion itself, and to promote it is not to support religion (even if, on balance, religion benefits from its promotion). For freedom of religion, banishing all coercion from the religious realm inevitably entails the freedom not to be religious. The church of one's choice at which one worships can be no church at all. And if one does choose to worship at a church, it can only be at a tolerant one, one that has laid its arrogance aside and recognized the right of all human beings to worship at any church or none.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freedom of religion is not itself religious; rather, it reflects the modern decision to put and keep religion in its proper place. It's best conceived not as sui generis but as one of the larger basket of personal freedoms, protection of which defines the core of liberal democracy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, far from contradicting Canada's commitment to secularism and tolerance, the creation of an Office of Religious Freedom will affirm it. Its goal will be the promotion not of religion as such but of respect for the rights of the individual in matters of religion. Its task will be to press illiberal regimes to treat religious dissenters more liberally. This will doubtless prove an uphill struggle, for, historically, freedom of religion has flourished only with other liberal freedoms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, there are many pitfalls here, but the impropriety of the very notion of an Office of Religious Freedom isn't one of them.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If alcoholism runs in my family, am I at greater risk?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as with other diseases such as diabetes and heart disease, alcoholism can also run in families, so you are at higher risk. Alcoholism is a disease that occurs when your body becomes dependent on alcohol. People who suffer from alcoholism often have a loss of control over their ability to limit the amount they drink, can have severe and often uncontrollable cravings for alcohol, and may have physical symptoms of withdrawal when they stop drinking. The loss of control and amount of drinking can have severe consequences on health, relationships, work life, finances and for some lead to legal problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alcoholism is believed to be caused by both genetic and environmental influences. Studies done on children where one or both parents are alcoholic have shown that they have a four to eight times higher risk of alcoholism when compared with those with no parental history of alcoholism. A study done in Denmark that followed more than 7,000 people demonstrated a strong correlation between parental alcoholism and alcohol abuse in their children that was independent of gender, social status and parental psychiatric illness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While these studies support that there is a strong hereditary influence in the development of alcoholism, we also have to consider external factors that may be involved as we are products not only of our genetic makeup but also of our environment. Supportive environments seem to protect against alcohol dependence even in those with a family history of alcoholism while environments with poor child-parent relationships can compound this risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as with the prevention of other diseases, if you know you have a higher risk for alcoholism due to family history, you can take steps by being aware and making some changes to decrease your risk such as:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Avoid underage drinking: Early drinking before the legal age limit is correlated with a higher risk of dependence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Drink in moderation. The new safe-drinking guidelines recently released by National Alcohol Strategy Advisory Committee recommend no more than two drinks a day, five times a week or 10 drinks total a week for women and no more than three drinks a day, five times a week or 15 drinks total a week for men. If it's difficult to drink within these limits, especially with a family history of alcoholism, it would be prudent to abstain completely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Seek help early: If you are noticing that drinking is becoming a problem, there are a number of resources in most communities. Al-Anon is one such organization that supports family members of alcoholics. Being open with your doctor about your concern of your family history can also help them monitor and offer support as needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bottom line: Just because there is a predisposition to alcoholism due to family history, it does not mean that it will automatically happen. It does mean, however, you need to use caution, monitor your alcohol consumption, and seek help early if necessary.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lesser known fact about the Calgary Flames' Jarome Iginla, who scored the 500th goal of his NHL career Saturday night to become only the 42nd player in history to do so: Iginla has every single one of those goals in an ever-changing video library at home, from the days of VHS to DVD, which pretty much spans his 15-year career.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Iginla, having a video record was partly meant to act as a keepsake and partly as a coaching tool, so that whenever he hit the cold patches that every scorer does, he could refer back to the good days and discover what, if anything, he was doing differently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iginla achieved the 500-goal milestone in Saturday's 3-1 victory over the Minnesota Wild, tying him with Flames legend Lanny McDonald for 41st on the all-time goals list, with yet another famous Flames right winger, Joey Mullen, next in his sights at 502.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a significant game on several levels. First, it helped erase the memory of a 9-0 shellacking to the Boston Bruins at the tail end of their seven-game, world-junior inspired road trip. More important, Iginla's goal finished as the game winner, the 80th of his career, and with Jaromir Jagr as the all-time leader at 113, and Iginla just 34, there is a chance he could finish his playing career as the No. 1 game-winning goal scorer of all time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iginla's parents were down from Edmonton to witness the game and that is a significant piece of news when people ponder his future in Calgary. There is a growing sentiment in town that the Flames are at a point where they will continue to be just good enough to miss the playoffs every year, without challenging for the Stanley Cup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If so, and since they are one of the oldest teams in the league, wouldn't it make sense to trade Iginla for younger talent now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, this line of thinking presupposes that Iginla wants to move and he clearly does not. He resolutely believes that the current incarnation of the Flames is a playoff team and once playoffs start, anything is possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the lesson of 2004, when Calgary made it to within a game of the Stanley Cup championship, losing in seven to the Tampa Bay Lightning, the closest Iginla has come to winning a title professionally (he has two Olympic and one world-junior gold on his résumé). Iginla likes it in Calgary. It is handy for both personal and professional reasons to be playing 300 kilometres south of his hometown of Edmonton, and because he has a no-trade clause in his contract, until something changes in terms of his mindset, he isn't moving anywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iginla's contract expires in the summer of 2013, so 14 months from now, at next year's trade deadline, he will arrive at a new career crossroads and then likely will be asked to reassess his future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 42 players to score 500 goals, only 15 managed the first 500 with the same team: Jean Béliveau, Mike Bossy, Wayne Gretzky, Bobby Hull, Gordie Howe, Guy Lafleur, Mario Lemieux, Stan Mikita, Mike Modano, Gilbert Perreault, Maurice Richard, Joe Sakic, Bryan Trottier and Steve Yzerman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's funny how nobody ever asked Béliveau at the end of his career, or Lemieux or Richard or Sakic or Yzerman, why they didn't want to move on to greener pastures when the fortunes of their current teams fell on hard times. It must be a sign of these mercenary times – that the motives of someone who demonstrates loyalty and commitment to an organization are questioned, not applauded. Strange how priorities can be misplaced.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are popular social phenomena that don't bear scrutiny. The Iowa Caucuses. The View. Ben Mulroney. Wondering why only leads to a popsicle headache. In sports, the incomprehensible extends to sports played by teenagers. Here in Canada we just witnessed the world junior hockey championship, which is essentially Doogie Howsers in shin pads for the holidays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. equivalent is college football bowl games. People in Tuscaloosa who can't spell university become deranged watching their favourite college on the 54 inch. Sponsors such as Beef 'O'Brady and TaxSlayer and Bell Helicopter can't throw enough money at not-ready-for-NFL lads in the latest <span class="companylink">Nike</span> kit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This curious process culminates Monday as LSU and Alabama meet in New Orleans for the mythical national championship of U.S. college football. We say mythical, because the teams were selected by a poll, not a playoff, and we know that polling is to reality as Tom Cruise is to acting. No matter. TV people are jacked about a couple of teams that played a 9-6 barn burner earlier this season (LSU won). They promise there will be more scoring this time. It could go 13-10 or even 14-13!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The difference between the world juniors just passed in Alberta and the NCAA Mardi Gras in Big Easy is that, while the hockey kids now go into witness protection for another year in junior hockey, college football is a multibillion-dollar TV staple six months of the year and grist for the journalistic mill 24/7. (Plus, you can bet on the National Collegiate Athletic Association.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to programming, college football revenue is more than the froth on your caramel macchiato. While junior hockey teams are worth a million or two, the disgraced Penn State football program grossed $54-million (U.S.) last year. Most industry analysts see no brake on TV's revenue accelerator as sports remain the final vestige of appointment viewing for networks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fuelled by the desire for more lucrative televised appointment games, the top tier of U.S. college football – Division I – is currently playing 52-pickup as teams skip from one conference to another in search of better TV revenues. The Big 10 now has 12 teams but the same title. The Pac 10 is now Pac 12. The Big East is losing two teams but gaining three others. The University of Texas now has its own network. These days it's an Adam Smith, laissez-faire, I-got-mine jumble funded by ESPN, CBS and all those other TV acronyms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In their quest to get more LSU and Alabama, TV executives are hoping that non-starters such as New Mexico State, Indiana and Tulane will just go away. The trend isn't limited to NCAA football. Baseball is the pro sports league that's closest to the NCAA, having figured out that ESPN and Fox only want a half dozen teams on network TV. The <span class="companylink">NHL</span> (U.S. Division) is headed in the same direction, offering NBC a schedule of a handful of prime markets while shunning the Nashvilles and Carolinas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increasingly, pro leagues will be pressured to deliver big markets if they want the big money. Leagues can run their franchise schemes with 30, 40 teams if they want. What ESPN and NBC want is simpler, more efficient. Bad news if you want the Super Bowl in Minnesota or the Stanley Cup in Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who dat'?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ESPN NFL analyst Jon Gruden clearly doesn't get out much. During the Orange Bowl last Thursday, a picture was shown of First Lady Michelle Obama. Said Gruden, “Hey there's a picture of our Lisa Salters [an ESPN reporter].” Or maybe he's a Republican.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A First Nations Education Act could arrive before Parliament this year, aimed at breaking the cycle of failure on reserve schools and representing one of the most important and unexpected priorities for the Harper government.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, this new initiative has been masked by accusations and controversy over who's to blame for the crisis conditions at Attawapiskat, or discussion on whether natives on reserves should be given property rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But native education is where the Conservatives hope to make their mark, and they just might succeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An important but largely overlooked report from the Senate committee on aboriginal peoples, chaired by Tory Senator Gerry St. Germain and supported by Senate Liberals, arrived in December urging legislation to create a native education system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report is getting a favourable response from key decision makers within the Harper government, according to sources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virtually every student in this country who does not live on reserve attends a school that is operated by a school board, that is presided over by a provincial ministry of education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is no education system for native communities. There are just schools on reserves run by band councils. Many of those isolated schools are staffed by inexperienced teachers, who are often paid less than those who teach in public schools. They work in inadequate buildings that have no computers or libraries, but plenty of mould. They teach children who desperately need above-average, not grossly below-average, support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In time, some will be lost to themselves, to their families and communities, and to this country,” the report concludes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many chiefs, especially younger ones just arriving on the scene, recognize that ending generations of poverty, ill health and joblessness on reserves begins with properly educating this generation of students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Nova Scotia, British Columbia and elsewhere, reserves are banding together to create native school boards that, with the help of provincial governments, pool resources, set standards and adopt a common curriculum that teaches native language and culture along with math, science and language arts. While fewer than half of native students on reserves graduate from high school nationally, the figure for Mi'kmaw students in Nova Scotia – most of whom attend a combination of reserve and provincial schools – is over 70 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate report proposes building on that model with legislation that would encourage – but not compel – native leaders across the country to co-operate in establishing school boards and even the native equivalent of education ministries, with federal education funding flowing through the new authorities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report, jointly commissioned by the Assembly of First Nations and the government, from a panel chaired by YMCA president Scott Haldane, is expected to provide specifics on how a national program to create native school boards might work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That report arrives in early February, not long after Prime Minister Stephen Harper meets with native chiefs in Ottawa to discuss education and other matters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The thinking is that the summit, the two reports and the growing co-operation between the chiefs and the Conservatives – on the education issue, if nothing else – could provide sufficient impetus for a First Nations Education Act that most chiefs would support. If all goes well, Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Duncan could present the bill to the House during the fall session.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Money, of course, will be the key. For 15 years, first nations education funding has grown at a rate of 2 per cent annually, far below the increases for provincial schools. Mr. Harper has let it be known that he is willing to put money into a first-nations education system that is effective and accountable, which is why the Tories are attracted to the idea of school boards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of this will be easy. This country has a horrible history of using education to undermine native culture, so we should expect a lot of resistance to any education act, even if some chiefs do endorse it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Conservatives have gone much farther down this path than anyone would have predicted. As has already been observed, this really could be Stephen Harper's equivalent of Nixon going to China.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's an old line, popular in 1960s sitcoms, that Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Brian Burke could have paraphrased last week, as he helpfully delivered an unofficial state-of-the-NHL union address.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: How's the rat race?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: The rats are winning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, rats will be featured prominently in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s second half, which officially begins Tuesday, one of 10 storylines worth monitoring in the months to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Last man standing (off-ice)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Columbus Blue Jackets added to the season's carnage by dumping Scott Arniel on Monday, making him the seventh head coach to walk the plank (not including off-season changes in Florida, Minnesota, Dallas, Ottawa and New Jersey). That's 12 teams that found issue with the man behind the bench in little more than 61/2 months. It could become a baker's dozen or more before season's end as the struggles mount in Tampa, Calgary, Edmonton, Colorado and on Long Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Last man standing (on-ice)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Injuries undermined the fortunes of a number of teams, but nobody survives them better than the Pittsburgh Penguins, and not just because Sidney Crosby has been limited to eight games because of concussion problems. No. 1 defenceman Kris Letang is also out with a concussion, while James Neal broke his foot blocking a shot last Saturday, and Jordan Staal is going to miss four to six weeks with a knee injury suffered last Friday. The Penguins are in the running for top spot in the Eastern Conference again, and if they ever get all hands on deck, they will be the prohibitive Stanley Cup favourites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. The MVP race</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">NHL</span> has had only one repeat Hart Memorial Trophy winner in the past dozen years (Alexander Ovechkin, 2008-09) and everybody who figured Ovie and Sid would alternate the way Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux once did needs to give that crystal ball a shake. Corey Perry, last year's most valuable player, is not in contention this year, but Jonathan Toews (Chicago), Henrik Lundqvist (New York), Evgeni Malkin (Pittsburgh) and maybe even Daniel Sedin (Vancouver) are all in the mix this time around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Whither the</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rangers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York Rangers head coach John Tortorella was upstaged (slightly) by the wild man in Philadelphia, Flyers goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov, in the HBO 24/7 series – which is good news in a way. Despite playing in a major market and with the attendant exposure from the Winter Classic outdoor game, the Rangers have flown mainly under the radar as they unexpectedly push for top spot in the East. Unlike so many free agents who switched teams this year, centre Brad Richards is actually providing some medium bang for the buck (31 points in 39 games), and his presence has put Marian Gaborik (23 goals) into the mix for the Maurice (Rocket) Richard Trophy. The Rangers have won just two playoff rounds in the past 13 years, but it looks as if they'll get a chance to up that count in the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. Can Florida scratch its playoff itch?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Florida Panthers, though fading a little, are hanging on to a playoff spot in the Southeast Division, which would be their first in 11 years – the longest current drought among <span class="companylink">NHL</span> teams. In its 17-year history, Florida has made the playoffs just three times (twice in its first four seasons). The bonus to having the Panthers in the postseason: a chance to get those plastic rats, circa 1996, out of storage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. Thrashing about in Winnipeg</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And speaking of lengthy playoff absences, the Winnipeg Jets (nee the Atlanta Thrashers) are in contention to make the postseason for just the second time in 12 years. No one in Winnipeg cares much for all that Atlanta futility – somebody else's – but with the Montreal Canadiens' struggles and Toronto Maple Leafs' fade, the Jets, Vancouver Canucks and Ottawa Senators might be the only Canadian teams to qualify for postseason play. Maybe staying put in the Eastern Conference isn't such a bad idea after all. …</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">7. Whatever</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">happened to …</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin St. Louis, Jarome Iginla, Alexander Ovechkin, Henrik Zetterberg, Eric Staal, Ryan Getzlaf and Ryan Kesler, respectively, second, sixth, seventh, ninth, 10th, 14th and 15th in last year's <span class="companylink">NHL</span> scoring race – none of whom can be found in the top 40 this time around. Staal, checking in at No. 78, and Getzlaf, at No. 92, are particularly perverse head-scratchers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8. Also fading fast</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former Maurice (Rocket) Richard Trophy winners Rick Nash (72nd in scoring) and Vincent Lecavalier (82nd); two-time 50-goal scorer Dany Heatley (84th); and Colorado's dynamic scoring duo Matt Duchene (113th) and Paul Stastny (135th). And though injuries have played a part in his slow start, Jeff Carter (17 points in 30 games) hasn't been lighting it up for Columbus either. The new motto for off-season free-agent shopping: Caveat emptor!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9. The trade deadline</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the run-up to last year's trade deadline, all the important deals were done well ahead of time, leaving it to the Dustin Penners and Dennis Widemans to create the listless 11th-hour chatter for all those hockey analysts. But with Columbus, Anaheim, Carolina and others running up the white flag already, there could be a number of attractive, if expensive, pieces up for grabs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10. The winner is …</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Picking a Stanley Cup final at midseason is only slightly less silly than picking one in October, but based on Saturday's game between the Vancouver Canucks and Boston Bruins, anyone without a rooting interest in the matter must welcome the possibility of a rematch. Some rivalries are conjured artificially. This one, based on a dramatic seven-game series last spring, is the real thing. To see Brad Marchand get under the skin of an entire team again, and how the Canucks might respond to his rat-titude? Worth the price of admission.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We need more bad financial news these days like the NHL needs another concussed hockey player.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that's exactly what personal finance authority Gordon Pape has given us in his latest book about retirement. It's called Retirement's Harsh New Realities and you can forget any ideas you might have about hyperbole being used to sell books. Not with well-documented chapters carrying titles such as Pension Plans Are Dying, Our Savings Rates Are Pitiful and There Is No Safe Place For Your Money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I talked to Mr. Pape to find out why he's so concerned about our readiness to retire to a life of financial comfort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before we plunge into the harsh realities listed in your book, is anything going well on the retirement front?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've got the Canada Pension Plan right. In the United States, they're talking about increasing the age at which you can start withdrawing [social security] benefits, and we're seeing similar problems in many of the European countries. The CPP, after years of tinkering in the 1980s and 1990s, is on a very stable course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the harsh realities you mention is that “we're on our own” in terms of retirement saving. But what about the CPP, Old Age Security and the Guaranteed Income Supplement – how significant are they for the average retiree?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're a basic safety net – that's really the best way to describe them. The CPP is only designed to ensure that you get 25 per cent of your pensionable earnings up to the maximum amount in any given year. OAS is obviously some icing on the CPP cake, but remember there's a clawback that cuts in when your income hits about $67,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harsh Reality No. 4 in your book is Our Savings Rates Are Pitiful. Why aren't people saving more money for retirement?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's because we live in a consumer society and we're constantly bombarded with exhortations to take more credit, get out and spend, support the economy. … It's the world in which we live. It was easy to save money back in the days before credit cards became widespread. Now, with credit cards and debit cards out there, it's too easy to spend money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How comfortable are you with the idea of seniors going into retirement with a substantial mortgage or line of credit debt?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not comfortable at all. One of the pieces of advice I give in the book is that even if you have to work a few more years, pay off your debts before you get into retirement. Once your income becomes fixed, you become very vulnerable to a rise in interest rates and you may find yourself having to compromise your standard of living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You say in your book that people “have to make sacrifices” in order to save enough for retirement. What specific sacrifices do you mean?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The No. 1 thing is you have to really work out what you need to save so you can live comfortably in retirement. And then you have to adjust your spending to meet those saving requirements. A lot of the conventional estimates of how much you need to save – like putting aside 5 per cent or 10 per cent of your income – aren't enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax system is stacked against retirees, according to your book. You've already mentioned the OAS clawback – do you have any other examples?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the things that really bugs me is the application of the dividend tax credit gross-up and the phantom income it creates. This affects not only the OAS clawback, but any taxable benefit that is income-tested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's talk about pension plans. If I have a defined benefit plan, how confident can I be that I'll receive the full amount of benefits I'm expecting after I retire?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People working at Nortel in the 1990s probably never thought that brilliant, burgeoning company was going to go down the tubes in the 2000s and leave them in a pension crisis. The only advice I can give on that score is to be constantly aware of the condition of your company pension plan. Monitor the annual reports, carefully check on whether it's in surplus or deficit. Obviously, if it's in deficit that's a concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's your best advice to help people in their twenties and thirties save enough for retirement so that they don't have to worry about the harsh realities you cover in your book?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best advice I can give is to start saving seriously. We have in Canada two of the best government-sanctioned retirement and tax savings programs, the RRSP and the tax-free savings account. I think people should be taking maximum advantage of those. One of the real tragedies in this country is that we have such a low participation rate in RRSPs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's nice having a direct line to Rupert Murdoch, who's appeared on Twitter of late. Previously, knowing Rupert Murdoch's mind required some divination, since we could only see it through the filter of a multibillion-dollar news organization, which presumably reflects his views, but only once it's been through several layers of management, editing, production and assorted voice mail. But now he's on Twitter, and we can see the big man's thoughts directly.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Santorum right. America a big, good society capable of anything. Not libertarian!” Rupert Murdoch says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“International Court of Justice. Will never succeed. See today's Journal book reviews,” Rupert Murdoch says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Obama out to lunch!” says Rupert Murdoch, sounding increasingly like your dad yelling at the television, except he owns the television and everything on it. It's actually endearing: He's got a distinct voice and a punchy delivery. By any standard of corporate communication, it's a good read.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, here's the thing. How do we know it's really Rupert Murdoch? Some evidence is circumstantial: He puts two spaces between his sentences, which is not surefire proof of an octogenarian, but certainly points in that direction. Moreover, he tweets in the clipped style of one whose early media training mostly involved telegrams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if that's not enough, there's one more bit of proof: A blue checkmark appears on his Twitter page, indicating that the Internet company has authenticated him as the real thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If only everyone else was so lucky. At about the same time as Mr. Murdoch appeared on the service, an account appeared in the name of his wife, Wendi Deng. It was filled with vacuous chatter; none too offensive, but none too flattering, either. It was given a checkmark of authenticity, and so, in effect, it became her actual voice. Her statements were credulously reported around the world as if spoken into a microphone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't until a day later that the truth came out: The Wendi Deng account was a hoax, the tweets were written by a male Londoner, and Twitter had fluffed the process of verifying the account. The company has remained tight-lipped about what happened, but tech blogger Kara Swisher reported that the error that launched a thousand corrections came down to a simple typo – someone at Twitter authenticated a fake account called @wendi_deng instead of a real one called @wendideng.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You'd think we'd have the business of real names on the Internet sorted by now, but no. The argument over whether it's better to use real names online has been going in circles for decades. (Team real names: “People are horrible when they're anonymous!” Team anonymity: “But think of the dissidents!”) But let's talk about verified identity where it really matters: celebrity prattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For better or for worse, Twitter has staked a claim on celebrity prattle as one of its selling points. It offers stars an easy, off-the-cuff way of reaching out to large followings, and it gives fans a correspondingly unfiltered glimpse into their idols' psyches. Justin Bieber tweets to a nation of foaming, lurching tweens. A rapper is scarcely a rapper without a Twitter account. From time to time, Kanye West avails himself of the opportunity to come unhinged on the service, which always draws a crowd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Twitter has a vested interest in establishing the bona fides of celebrities, especially since the parts of the Internet not strewn with Bieber fever victims have been colonized by aspiring celebrity parodists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the reason that Twitter isn't saying much about what happened in the Deng case is that, by all appearances, its verification process is completely ad hoc. It used to have a program by which blue checkmarks were dispensed to qualifying individuals, but it was phased out, leaving verifications in an arbitrary limbo. It's unclear what it takes to qualify these days, though apparently being Rupert Murdoch will do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Verifying celebrity identity is a double-edged sword that it has more power to do harm than good. A false positive can do more harm than a lack of accreditation. When Twitter lent its stamp of approval to the wrong Wendi Deng, the prankster behind the fake account was given carte blanche to speak in her name, and the global media, largely satisfied by Twitter's approbation, took the service at its word.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the lessons here is that Twitter has become an important and integrated part of the world's news-gathering operation. By staying the business of authenticating celebrities, it's taking on a lot of responsibility for what's said. A scheme in which a few users are deemed famous enough to be certified, but a hundred-million-odd other voices aren't, is a strange way to run a global network. Where is the line? If a starlet with one million followers gets a checkmark, but a starlet with 900,000 doesn't, does that mean that the lesser starlet's feed is untrustworthy? Does my own piddling little Twitter account speak for me, despite the lack of a checkmark? How can Twitter verify that some people are who they say they are without verifying everybody?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By certifying celebrities, Twitter has gotten itself into the trust business. But trust requires process, and until some process becomes apparent, the old aphorism about anonymity will hold: On the Internet, no one knows you're an Australian billionaire.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I make no apologies for liking chocolate of all kinds, from single-estate artisanal truffles to candy bars. So, for me, Christmas is on Nov. 1, when all the unsold Halloween goodies go on sale for 75 per cent off. For my girlfriend, it's Boxing Day, because the price of Christmas cards are similarly slashed. In fact, there are many things we buy that have a seasonal sweet spot in terms of savings.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often, it comes down to supply and demand. The supply as well as the demand for candy is high leading up to Oct. 31, but subsequently drops off. A fire-sale ensues as retailers don't want to take up valuable space with hard-to-sell leftovers. The reduced profit, or in some cases a loss, might be more than made up for by quickly moving the next season or event's goods when their demand, and fatter margins, are surging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The advantage of seasonal demand in a country like Canada can be exacerbated by the more distinctive seasons we experience. That means demand for many things comes in short, strong bursts. You can save big by buying off-cycle: sweaters in spring, air conditioning units in winter, patio furniture in fall, etc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Online communities and auctions have varying demand at different times of the year, too. Even if you are buying used items, it's worth keeping this in mind. If you are a buyer, buy off-cycle. If you are a seller, sell on-cycle instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other cases, seasonal deals lie with helping retailers clear space for next year's new models. Traditionally, right before the Super Bowl is when you can find great deals on big screen TVs. All of last year's stock that didn't sell before or after Christmas might be up for a Hail Mary type sale to make way for, I don't know … the 4D super ultra HD TVs for 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When an auto manufacturer announces that a revamped model of your favourite car is coming to showrooms, you can expect two things. Every earlier model of that same car on the used market is less attractive, which can lower the going rates, and you might be able to find some really slick deals on last year's model that's probably still on the salesroom floor. The deals may not manifest in a price drop, but through other things like reduced financing costs, bigger rebates, or package upgrades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot of buyers are less likely to buy the first year of a new model with the belief that a few bugs will crop up that need to be ironed out. By that logic, the final year of the previous model should be as good as it gets quality-wise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With all retail savings advice, it's important to remember that saving 80 per cent on something you weren't otherwise going to buy is no savings at all. But if you happen to be in the market for a particular item, think about when most people buy them. If it's seasonal, think about waiting six months. If it's event-driven, think about waiting until the day after the event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many people, emotion trumps logic. And that's a big factor in retailer's pricing strategies. You can use it to your advantage, or get taken advantage of.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Léon Mugesera's time of reckoning in Rwanda may at last be at hand. That would be a good thing for Canada, which gave safe haven for nearly two decades to a man accused of crimes against humanity. And it would be an even better thing for Rwanda, and for all international efforts aimed at preventing genocide. (Mr. Mugesera is scheduled to be deported on Thursday, and is in Federal Court this week asking for a last-ditch reprieve.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mugesera's day in court lasted 17 years in Canada. This country is committed to due process, as it should be. At one point, he managed to convince a desperately naive Federal Court of Appeal that a 1992 speech was not an incitement to murder and genocide. “Why do they not exterminate all of them? Are we really waiting till they come to exterminate us?” he had said. And, “Do not be afraid, know that anyone whose neck you do not cut is the one who will cut your neck.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thankfully, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled 8-0 that, at a time of ethnic conflagration, these words and others counselled murder. Perhaps the court had benefited from the presence, for a while, of justice Louise Arbour, a former prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda. (She was gone from the Supreme Court by the time the case arrived.) Or perhaps it was tempted to think the worst when Mr. Mugesera's lawyer, Guy Bertrand, alleged in a written motion that the court was beset by an extensive Jewish conspiracy that “contaminated” all members. (The court called that motion every scurrilous name it could think of.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 1992 speech the court said, “Viewed objectively, Mr. Mugesera's message was likely to incite, and was made with a view to inciting, murder. Mr. Mugesera conveyed to his listeners, in extremely violent language, the message that they faced a choice of either exterminating the Tutsi, the accomplices of the Tutsi, and their own political opponents, or being exterminated by them.” Seventeen months later, the genocide began, and 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mugesera has lived in freedom in Quebec City because Rwanda's judicial system and prisons were seen as unsafe for war criminals. But Rwanda has now dropped the death penalty and life in solitary confinement, and rulings by the European Court of Human Rights and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda have found improvements in judicial independence and prison conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada should not be a haven for the promoters of mass murder. A fair, public trial in Rwanda would undermine the culture of impunity that fuelled the genocide.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the summer of 2009, China's Foreign Ministry made a demand of the U.S. embassy: Stop making measurements of air pollution in Beijing available to ordinary Chinese since they conflicted with official data and could lead to “confusion” among the public and undesirable “social consequences.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Americans refused to comply. For the past 2½ years, they've continued to announce hourly their findings of the air quality over the embassy, which is in a “not that polluted” area of the capital, and to put them on an embassy-managed Twitter site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble is, while the Americans were measuring – and disclosing – the concentration of “fine” particulate smaller than 2.5 micrometres in diameter (PM2.5) – which pose the greatest risk to human health – the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau's air pollution index reflected only the concentration of the much larger PM10 particles. This resulted in the embassy's characterizing the air quality as “unhealthy” or “very unhealthy,” while Beijing reported a “blue sky day” with “good” air quality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese government's primary concern was that it should not lose face before its people, that Chinese citizens not be given information that could be used to question the validity of the government's data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The embassy reported on this conversation in a cable to the State Department. The cable, among the thousands made public by WikiLeaks, makes clear that, in the view of China's Foreign Ministry, the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau should be “the sole authoritative voice for making pronouncements on Beijing's air quality.” It was as though providing information to the Chinese public on the quality of the air they were breathing was somehow interference in China's internal affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, China was right about one thing. After the public found out they had been fed misleading information that affected their health, they were confused by the conflicting information available, questioned the official data and launched a social movement, insisting that more complete information be made available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That movement has led to success. In November, the China Daily reported that the Ministry of Environmental Protection would solicit public opinion on revised air quality standards, “following widespread calls for the government to provide more information on pollution.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, The Wall Street Journal ran an article under the headline, Victory for U.S. Embassy as Beijing Chokes on ‘Heavy Fog.' It reported a “fundamental shift” in the willingness of Chinese city dwellers to accept the government's definition of fog at face value and said the U.S. embassy has been “instrumental in piercing the veil around air quality in China's capital.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Friday, the official Xinhua news agency reported that Beijing would “start releasing data about the amount of tiny particulate matter that is detected in the air” before the lunar New Year, which is on Jan. 23. The Environmental Protection Bureau had this information all along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some other Chinese cities have also said they will start publishing information about PM2.5 readings this year, including Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Dalian and Chongqing. By 2016, such information should be available for the whole country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a huge victory not just for the U.S. embassy but for the Chinese people – a victory for openness, for transparency, for access to information and, most important, for public accountability over bureaucracy, for putting the health of the people over the face of government officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's natural for people to want information that affects their well-being. They will want that from any source, foreign or local. Of course, it would best if the Chinese government should supply this information rather than try to suppress it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In principle, the more information that can be made available, the better. And a government that allows a free flow of information is a government that demonstrates confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actually, even if the U.S. embassy had been cowed into submission, the relevant information would certainly have reached the Chinese public sooner or later. You can't fool all the people all the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This development may well have a bearing on the Chinese Foreign Ministry's current campaign to prevent members of the Hong Kong public from talking to officials of the U.S. consulate there. China has nothing to fear from such contact. If anything, the more contact there is between the public and foreign diplomats, the better – since that's one way of ensuring that foreign countries will have a better understanding of how Chinese people think and feel.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environmental groups argue that the pipeline, which will carry heavy oil from the oil/tar sands of Alberta to the Pacific coast, will imperil vast tracts of pristine wilderness as well as the traditional way of life of indigenous peoples. The reality is far more interesting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither Kitimat, B.C., the coastal town where the pipeline would end, nor the Haisla people, whose ancestral land it is, are strangers to development. The town is home to a giant aluminum smelter and a deep-sea port. Billions of dollars are flowing in to build a new liquid natural gas terminal. The 1,500 Haisla (only 700 of whom live in the town) will soon collect more money in rents and royalties than they receive from the federal government. They are dead set against the pipeline – for now. And the rat's nest of aboriginal title issues in B.C. means the deal could be tied up in the courts for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 700,000 kilometres of oil and gas pipelines already criss-cross Canada. But for the worldwide environmental movement, any pipelines that carry heavy oil from Alberta are the embodiment of hydrocarbon-spewing evil. They could be nuclear-bomb-proof and it wouldn't matter. Many pipeline opponents really want to shut down the sands altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Stephen Harper has taken to calling these opponents “radical groups” funded by foreign money. It's true that Canadian groups do get money – lots of it – from well-heeled foreign backers. And they've used it well. For years, they've run rings around the better-heeled oil and pipeline giants, who've been good at extracting bitumen but bad at making their case to the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Somewhere between these two rhetorical extremes is the voice of common sense, which is barely audible in all the din. Unfortunately, the two-year-long public hearings into the Northern Gateway pipeline are unlikely to enlighten citizens who really want a sensible balance between economic and legitimate environmental interests. The National Energy Board will hear from no fewer than 4,000 intervenors, most of whom will be repeating the same objections over and over. Then it will make its recommendation to the cabinet, which is free to overrule it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike Barack Obama, Mr. Harper won't let domestic opposition influence his call. No prime minister would. The economic case is so compelling that any government in power would support it. A thirsty world wants our oil, and the more efficiently we can get it to them, the better. And better access to markets could add $131-billion to Canada's economy by 2030, according to a study by the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy. That includes more than $27-billion that would go to governments in taxes and royalties. “The rewards of additional pipelines for all of Canada are too great to ignore,” says the institute's Michal Moore. “Pipelines must be a national priority.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is hardly unique in the battles over new and unconventional forms of energy. Discoveries of shale oil are fuelling an energy boom in job-hungry states across the U.S. – and also a firestorm of controversy. The truth is, no form of energy extraction is risk-free. The trick is to find the level of risk that's politically acceptable, and hope to avoid nasty surprises. No one wants a tanker spill. But all that money could help improve a lot of native schools.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An apparently bizarre decision to have newspapers determine what documentary films qualify for Oscars is, in fact, only one small aspect of sweeping changes in the Oscars documentary film nomination process designed to better reflect voters' consensus.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday, The New York Times broke the story that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will implement a new policy for the 2013 ceremony that it will only consider documentaries for Oscar contention after they have been reviewed by The New York Times or the Los Angeles Times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the review policy is only one minor element in changes, pushed by filmmaker and Academy board of governors member Michael Moore, designed to make the documentary race more credible and representative of popular appeal. The problem of mainstream and celebrated documentaries being left off the list has been chronic and reflects a flaw in the existing system. This year, for example, successful documentaries including Senna, Into the Abyss, The Interrupters and The Arbor were all left off the documentary feature long list. In the past, such prominent films as Capitalism: A Love Story and Hoop Dreams and The Thin Blue Line were ignored by the Academy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was not strictly a matter of the taste of voters in the documentary branch, but a process that was open to error. In the current system, volunteers form multiple committees watch dozens of qualifying documentaries (124 this year) and then offer their top choices for the 15-film short list before the list was whittled down to five nominees. Not everyone sees the same films and a few negative votes can keep a critically lauded and popular film out of contention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why prominent filmmakers such as Steve James (Hoop Dreams), Morgan Spurlock (Super Size Me) and Moore support the new system, in which the entire 157 members of the documentary branch will be able to see all the films, delivered either by DVD or online in quarterly instalments, before choosing the nominated films. After that, the more than 6,000 members of the Academy will vote on the best documentary, after seeing the top five choices on DVDs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Moore explained to the film site Indiewire, the new system will cut the number of qualifying films in half (to about 60), but will benefit documentary filmmakers by focusing on theatrical documentaries and allowing the entire Academy to be involved in the final decision. As Moore told another website, Awards Daily: “The Academy says it's decided what the best documentary of the year is. But if only 5 per cent of the Academy are deciding that we're not telling the truth. Wouldn't it be more honest,” he said, “if we let the whole Academy vote?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The motive for the reviewing rule is to avoid producers of made-for-television documentaries holding under-the-radar screenings of documentaries in order to technically qualify for the Academy Awards. The Academy has not yet specified whether reviews need be in print, or whether capsule or online reviews would apply, but reviews by television critics are specifically ruled out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The review policy also has some flexibility. If The New York Times changes its policy of reviewing every documentary with a one-week run in Manhattan, then the Academy will also change its policy. If, for some reason, a film is not reviewed, the filmmaker can appeal to the Academy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One potential casualty of the new process is DocuWeeks, an annual event in New York and Los Angeles, in which filmmakers pay money to submit their documentaries specifically for a one-week Oscar-qualifying run. One film that went through the DocuWeeks process was Lucy Walker's Waste Land, a nominee last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Academy Awards, the documentary branch and the foreign-language films are perennially among the most controversial categories. The documentaries branch has made a series of voting changes, especially in the last decade when the market for theatrical documentary film has boomed. The best foreign-language film category – in which a committee in each country gets to nominate one film which are then narrowed down by an Academy nominating committee – has not made any significant improvements in the same period.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is Alana, a charismatic six-year-old “beauty queen diva,” laughing at her competition on Toddlers &amp; Tiaras.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while her episode does not air until Wednesday night, the tiny McIntyre, Ga., belle is already an Internet starlet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TLC show has been drawing heat since its inception in 2009, peaking last summer, when Maddy, a four-year-old, wore breasts and padding to look like Dolly Parton and when, a month later, a three-year-old named Paisley dressed as Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman – in the outfit she trolls in, as a Hollywood hooker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The six-minute Alana clip is everywhere online, drawing the usual outrage. The most common criticism of the show – on which the eponymous toddlers dress in full makeup, their hair coiffed and “jacked to Jesus” (teased to where the Good Lord may see it better, one stylist explains) and pose daringly – is that the show constitutes child abuse and pornography.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is there any validity to the constant stream of criticism shadowing this popular show?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes and no. Abuse and pornography are very strong and meaningful terms that apply only in degrees here. The girls are comparable to made-up princesses or fairies, and clearly playing dress-up. Yet once these images leave the pageant, so to speak, and become available online, they lose their context and are, effectively, unprotected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are these disgusting accusations true of Alana's mother?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's start with the child herself. She vacillates about being a queen. She is alternately wound-up and listless, calling herself both “bored” and “sad” on different occasions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then again, the secret “go-go juice” that her nightmarish mother concocts for her may explain the highs and lows. We are never told what is in the juice: Alana is made to sip from a green bottle in lieu of the “pageant crack,” or Pixy Stix powder, the other girls use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mom is unperturbed by the controversial activity of ramping up one's child for a show. If it “works,” she shrugs, “use it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it does not work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Alana is on the juice, she is too high, too spinny.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Left to her own devices, she is probably the greatest child performer in the world. In the moments she is on-screen, she is hilarious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grabbing and manipulating her belly after placing third as Daisy Duke, she says of the judges: “Look at this big thing. They don't know a good thing when they see it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here and elsewhere, she is a natural comedian and, better, an authentic drag queen, who understands the deeper, darker aspects of imposture; the complexity of actual self-love. (Alana's view of her chubbiness as gorgeous is far healthier than average, and spectacularly showy.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you were her mother – imagine you are a plain, working-class woman and a “coupon queen” – wouldn't you feel blessed by this beautiful, gifted child?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Watching Alana's mother cheer for her – she stands up and bellows, WORK IT SMOOCHIE! while rocking her pelvis – is poignant and harsh, at once.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are already several mocking <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> videos of this cheering, which is disquieting in slow motion, given the violent intensity on the mother's face. But hating her for being a pushy stage mother is too easy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She never should have mildly doped her child or directed her to act sexy. She is tacky and loud, but other emotions play across features nearly buried in her sad face: hope, pride, love.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the mother and daughter speak, it is tenderly; and when Alana says, out of the blue, “I wanna make monnnn-ey! A dolla makes me holla!” her mother bursts out laughing, as so many of us have, watching this little reel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We all know that child stars usually come to bad, if not tragic, ends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But pageantry is a little different. Beauty queens do not expect to ply their trade for their whole life, and most of them stop when they are old enough to put aside the hairspray and tiaras as childish things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the last Toddlers &amp; Tiaras episode of 2011, three-year-old Penny Lane just started screaming. She'll never make it in this cut-throat circuit!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She would be crazy to think otherwise, honey boo-boo child.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sit yourself down for an intriguing Canadian potboiler, a story that involves allegations of a clandestine, one-last-time tryst with a former prime minister, millions of dollars, bitter antipathy toward the man who raised him, a mother on the edge of dementia, and – steady now – an uncanny similarity of jowls.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And all of it is sitting here in front of me, wearing a suit, powerful cologne and a cloak of indignation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The man who would be John George Diefenbaker II, if he can get DNA tests to prove it, is telling his story in a breakfast joint on Bloor Street in Toronto, where he knows the waitresses by name and favours thick slices of white toast, washed down with dishwater coffee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Absolutely I would change my name [to Diefenbaker],” says George Dryden, straightening his collar a bit. “That's what I am. I'm not a Dryden. They hate me. And I wouldn't change it to Smith. Or Goldenberg,” he scoffs, surprised that anyone would question his desire to change his surname.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Dryden's story begins with his mother, Mary Lou Lonergan, an entertainer/socialite who was involved in conservative political associations in the sixties. She was single, in her 30s and reportedly “adored” Mr. Diefenbaker, who was married and more than 30 years her senior. There are photographs of them together at public events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1967, she married Gordon Dryden. But her son believes that when she returned to Toronto from a six-week European honeymoon in the late fall of that year, she had a meeting with Mr. Diefenbaker, on the brink of retirement as leader of the opposition. (His six-year run as prime minister had ended in 1963.) “I think this was one last goodbye, and one thing led to another. Three months after she was married, I was conceived by Diefenbaker,” alleges Mr. Dryden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question of his paternity is related to a $30-million lawsuit, launched in 2010, against the man who raised him, Gordon Dryden, his mother and his brother, Barrie. He claims that Gordon Dryden knew or suspected that he was not his biological father and therefore not only mistreated him but breached his fiduciary duties, cutting him out of a windfall inheritance from an uncle's estate. The lawsuit was dismissed late last year except for a defamation claim against Gordon Dryden. Lawyers for George Dryden are appealing the judgment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I never had a hug from Gordon Dryden. We were never close,” he says, adding that their antagonism worsened when he became a teenager. A paternity test in June last year proved that Mr. Dryden is not his biological father. The suggestion that he is Mr. Diefenbaker's only biological son – Canada's 13th prime minister had no children from either of his two marriages – was long rumoured by members of Mr. Dryden's family, because of similarities in appearance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An attempt to get DNA samples from artifacts at Saskatchewan's Diefenbaker Canada Centre came back inconclusive in late December. Members of the extended Diefenbaker family have so far refused to co-operate with information or DNA samples. “They're worried about legacy… I'm not suing the Diefenbaker estate [for money],” he explains, indignant at the very thought. “The estate has been wound up for 35 years. And even if I could, I don't think he had any money.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The woman who could help clarify the facts, his mother, 77, is ailing and being kept from him by Gordon Dryden, a wealthy patriarch in his 80s, he says. “If I can spend an hour or two with her over a few days, she would tell me. I know that for a fact.” He saw her briefly last June and even though doctors said she was suffering from dementia, she was lucid, he explains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that his father could be Mr. Diefenbaker is what gives the story its sensational appeal. “It's a story that could rewrite the history books,” his lawyer, Stephen Edell, says in an telephone interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it doesn't have an impact on his lawsuit, other than help him make sense of what he says has been lifelong antipathy from the man who happened to be an ambitious, powerful Liberal at the time. “They hated each other. They were enemies! And every time he looked at me, not only did he see John Diefenbaker, he saw that his wife was having an affair with the enemy! The innocence of my birth screwed me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the identity of his biological father has no bearing on the outcome of his court case, why he is spending on all his energy and time pursuing it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It has just been a year,” he retorts. “It's not a life mission,” he says, dismissing the idea that he's obsessed with finding out the truth. “It's about finding out who my father is. If it's not Diefenbaker, we'll take another shot at who.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But clearly, a famous last name would give him a coveted sense of belonging. “I'm confident that [Diefenbaker] is my father, because if he's not I have no idea who it would be,” he admits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if he's not able to prove he is the son of Mr. Diefenbaker through DNA or other means?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have new leads,” he offers conspiratorially.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Divorced with no children, the 43-year-old worked for a family business after high school, never attending university. After he left – having been pushed out of the real estate and investment firm by Mr. Dryden, he alleges – he started up his own marketing company. A few years ago, he decided to work as a self-employed legal consultant even though he has no formal training in law. Now, most of his time is spent working on the mystery of his paternity and on his court appeal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has read some biographies of Mr. Diefenbaker. “I would say I share general personality traits both good and bad,” he says. “The talking, the finger wagging, the jowls. Diefenbaker had a tendency to fly off the handle… I'm conservative and determined and not afraid to ruffle a few feathers.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if he did find out he's a Diefenbaker, would he run for political office?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“One thing I've learned is not to count chickens before they hatch,” he offers after a moment's hesitation. “But I'm open to any and all suggestions. If the country needed me, and I thought I could be of some assistance, I would be more than happy.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aren't there more important things to talk about? When the Liberals gather in Ottawa this weekend for a conference on the future of the party, one of the bigger items on the agenda will be the monarchy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals' youth wing is pushing to cut the final cord with Britain. It favours a policy resolution calling for the election of a Canadian as head of state. The party has occasionally flirted with such notions, but they've never taken wing. And now would hardly appear to be propitious timing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton giving it a big image boost, the monarchy has been showing signs of revitalization in Canada. The Conservative government has gone to considerable lengths to reconnect with royalty, an example being its rebranding of our navy and air force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why would the Grits want to mess with this harmless, symbolic institution when many other vital issues are before them?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, there are many reasons, some of which make sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One is that the party, condemned as lost in the middle, lost in the past and fading into irrelevance, needs a new vision. Becoming new, as some genius once concluded, means turning away from the old. Moving the country to its final stage of independence certainly has a modernizing look.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monarchy is hanging on in many countries, but it's hardly the way of the future. In Jamaica, the new Prime Minister, Portia Simpson Miller, has just announced that her country will complete the cycle of independence by initiating the process of becoming a republic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canadian history, the cycle of independence has been authored chiefly by the Liberal Party. It was under the Liberals in 1929 that the Statute of Westminster, which eliminated much of Britain's authority to make laws for Canada, was negotiated. It was under Lester Pearson in 1965 that Canada got its own flag. It was under Pierre Trudeau in 1982 that the Constitution was patriated. It's natural that the Liberals should be the party that takes the final step.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decoupling from the monarchy would be popular in Quebec, the province where that institution, for obvious reasons, is least popular. The Liberals need to rebuild their old base in Quebec. The monarchy move would help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monarchy is most popular with older Canadians, a demographic that the Conservatives have well in hand. But if you're looking to be the party of the future, it's the younger generations to whom you must appeal. Although William and Kate were a big hit in Canada with all age groups, the monarchy is less relevant to the younger set. And it's less relevant to an increasingly multiethnic Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals could use a severing of royalty ties as a gateway to something bigger – a modernization and reform of our ailing democratic system. Liberals are already talking about reducing the powers that any new leader of their party would have. Many also favour the idea of restructuring the divisions of powers in Ottawa so as to reverse the long-time trend toward one-man rule. But they've yet to come up with good ideas for the creation of a new democracy, one befitting the 21st century, one that could see them dealing with Senate reform or abolition as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To speak of doing away with ties to the monarchy or any grand reform reordering the power structure is difficult from a practical standpoint, in that it would likely require a constitutional amendment supported by the provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Liberals should at least give some consideration to the proposal being put forward by their youth wing. This is a party in need of a big idea, in need of a new frontier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data on illicit drug use are sorely lacking. It is no coincidence that public policy in this area is abysmal.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our response to drug use is, by and large, moralistic and vengeful, not evidence-based.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While we spend billions of dollars on the “War on Drugs,” there has been a pittance spent on research to understand the root causes of drug use (and addiction in particular), little dispassionate examination of the harms that result and, especially, analysis of the responses that will minimize those harms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you want to fashion sound public-health policies, you need good data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So a new series of studies, published in the Lancet, is a welcome contribution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The paper prepared by Louisa Degenhardt of the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre in Sydney, Australia, has received the most attention. It shows that at least one in 20 people aged 15 to 64 used illicit drugs in the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That includes an estimated:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• 125-203 million cannabis users (marijuana);</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• 56 million amphetamine users (speed, crystal meth);</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• 12-21 million problem users of opioids (heroin, oxycodone);</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• 14-21 million cocaine users.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers did not include data on use of drugs like hallucinogens, inhalants, steroids, or prescription drugs that are abused because data are unreliable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Degenhardt said the numbers are no doubt an underestimate. “Drug use is often hidden, particularly when people fear the consequence of being discovered for using drugs, such as being imprisoned,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worldwide, illicit drug use accounts for about 250,000 deaths each year. That is significant but still doesn't not compare to the deadly impact of legal drugs like alcohol, which kills 2.3 million a year, and tobacco, which causes 5.1 million deaths annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the vast majority of users of illicit drugs – particularly so-called soft drugs like cannabis – do not suffer appreciable harm. There are some societal costs like injuries from drugged driving, lost productivity and the violence sometimes associated with drug misuse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the real problems, individually and socially, stem from the minority of problematic or dependent users – addicts, in the common parlance. The new research estimates there are about 39 million addicts worldwide, most of them injection drug users.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Addiction is a disease, not a choice. But there is no doubt the disease and the drug-seeking leads to many poor choices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the overdoses they suffer, IV drug users are at high risk of contracting infectious diseases like hepatitis and HIV-AIDS, and often turn to risky practices like selling sex and committing crimes like break-ins to fuel their addiction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paradoxically, it is those who suffer the most harm physically who bear the brunt of public policies, most of which focus on repressive measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key question: Do those policies achieve what we want – to make the general population healthier and safer? For the most part, the answer is “No,” according to a second paper in The Lancet that was prepared by a team led by John Strang of the National Addiction Centre in London (which included Benedikt Fischer of Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, B.C.) The main anti-drug strategy worldwide is to try and control supply in a bid to drive up prices and make drugs less accessible. This includes imprisoning drug suppliers and dealers. Enforcement and sanctions vary dramatically from country to country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The research shows that incarcerating high-level dealers – like Colombian drug barons – can have an impact on supply and prices, at least temporarily, but street-level enforcement is generally costly and ineffective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prolonged imprisonment of drug users is also very expensive and does little to reduce illicit drug use. Researchers found, however, that specific, immediate and brief sentences – with mandated testing of offenders – is quite effective at reducing drug use and associated crime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legalization, or decriminalization, is often touted as a solution, but the study notes that most research in this area is of poor quality. However, there is good circumstantial evidence that decriminalization is effective at moving cannabis users away from other drug markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the prevention front, the news is rather grim. School-based and mass media programs alike are generally ineffective at influencing behaviour. There is a little bit of evidence showing that family-based or parenting programs might help young people make better choices. What works best, though, is secondary prevention – intervening early with those who misuse drugs (or alcohol). In other words, they need treatment, not didactic lectures and not punishment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, this is the approach that has shown to be the most influential with problematic users.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is good evidence, for example, that opioid substitution with drugs like methadone or buprenorphine reduces mortality, heroin use, crime, HIV and hepatitis infections. Residential rehab programs gets good marks, but the quality of the research is mediocre. Rehab is also expensive, although less expensive than prison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, the research shows that when it comes to illicit drugs, the focus needs to be on the problematic users, and that public-health measures work better than criminal sanctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no magic bullet – not zero tolerance and not supervised injection facilities. Rather, a broad range of interventions are required, targeting different drug problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hardest part of this approach may be setting aside our prejudices and preconceived notions to adopt evidence-based approaches that are not always politically popular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As The Lancet notes in an editorial highlighting the new research: “Few diseases can compete with addiction in their capacity to generate misinformation, misjudgment, or misunderstanding.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Addiction is a complex disease – a global problem that has no global solution, but rather many community-based solutions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a buyout king turning around troubled companies, Mitt Romney once practised the kind of “creative destruction” free market Republicans usually celebrate.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But desperate to blow up his candidacy, Mr. Romney's rivals for the party's presidential nod are suddenly digging into his past at <span class="companylink">Bain Capital</span> in search of ticking explosives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If and when the “Bain bomb” goes off, the likely beneficiary may not be any one of them. But President Barack Obama just might owe his re-election to their early groundwork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bain back story underscores a major liability the millionaire Mr. Romney could shoulder in a general election against Mr. Obama. At a time when income inequality, outsourcing and capitalist greed are scourges, he is a walking billboard for all three.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the eve of Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, which Mr. Romney is expected to win handily, the former Bain chief spent the day defending the messy art of capitalism as practised by the Boston-based buyout firm he led for 15 years until 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Wall Street Journal investigation published on Tuesday found that of the 77 companies Bain invested in under Mr. Romney's stewardship, at least 20 filed for bankruptcy or went out of business within eight years of Bain's initial involvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Romney and his Bain partners got fabulously rich in the process. The firm pocketed gains of $2.5-billion (U.S.) on the $1.1-billion it invested in the companies and Mr. Romney rode the wave to a personal net worth currently estimated at about $250-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether that makes Mr. Romney a capitalist hero or zero may depend on your politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the former Massachusetts governor did not help himself by telling a business audience on Tuesday that he liked “being able to fire people.” He meant insurance companies that provide bad service. But he should have known the comment would live on in infamy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was proof that even the most tightly scripted candidate of them all can occasionally blow his lines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An embittered Newt Gingrich, seemingly resigned to his fate in New Hampshire but hoping for rebirth in South Carolina, threw the first stone at Mr. Romney on Tuesday. “They apparently looted the companies, left people unemployed and walked off with millions of dollars,” the former Speaker of the House of Representatives said of Mr. Romney and his Bain cohorts. “That's not traditional capitalism.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas Governor Rick Perry, also betting it all on the Jan. 21 South Carolina primary, accused Mr. Romney of getting “rich off failures and sticking it to someone else.” Even former Utah governor Jon Huntsman, the most measured of the candidates, could not resist laying into Mr. Romney. But he had a more immediate need. He must break through in New Hampshire to have any hope of continuing on to South Carolina.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Governor Romney enjoys firing people. I enjoy creating jobs,” Mr. Huntsman said. “It may be that he's slightly out of touch with the economic reality playing out in America right now, and that's a dangerous place to be.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a rally at a metalwork factory here, Mr. Romney was forced to spend a rare press conference defending his Bain record, reiterating his assertion that the businesses in which the firm invested on his watch went on to create more than 100,000 net new jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If [voters] want President Obama and a loss of two million jobs, a decline of median income in America by 10 per cent and people looking at very difficult prospects going forward, they can choose President Obama,” he charged. “But if they want someone who understands how this economy works at the level of job creation – of businesses failing and succeeding – that's what I can bring to the table.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That pitch may become a tougher sell as voters are exposed to attack ads put out by Mr. Romney's GOP rivals and the Obama campaign that focus on Bain's darker side. Indeed, a group that supports Mr. Gingrich will begin running television ads in South Carolina this week that draw on a scathing documentary about Mr. Romney's Bain legacy. The $3.4-million ad buy is massive by South Carolina standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Nothing mattered but greed,” says the trailer for the film, King of Bain, which calls Mr. Romney a “predatory corporate raider” and “scavenger.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Palmetto State has a reputation for dirty politics. There is no telling what politicians as desperate as Mr. Gingrich or Mr. Perry, who is still sitting on millions raised at the outset of his candidacy, might resort to. South Carolina is by all accounts their last chance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is hard to believe the Romney campaign – whose operatives spare no detail, down to the floor tape telling their candidate where to stand – had not anticipated all of this. But could it be they forgot to ask the focus groups what they thought about having a predatory corporate raider for president?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are three weird things about the new Fox drama Touch, which is all about connectivity.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the show (sneak preview on Jan. 25, starts in March) stars Kiefer Sutherland and it's still impossible not to think of him as Jack Bauer from 24. Second, it makes an ambiguous connection between autism and mystical powers. Third, it is yet another show that dwells on the impact of 9/11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kiefer Sutherland faced 10 questions about Jack Bauer in the course of 30 minutes on Sunday. He wasn't annoyed. He was here to talk about Touch, but he's not letting go of Bauer, the guy who saved the United States from terrorism for eight seasons. In fact, he let it slip that the 24 movie will start shooting in late April or May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Touch, he plays the father of a silent, autistic boy, Jake, whose ability to see connections and patterns seems to allow him to predict the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sutherland said he was on Broadway doing That Championship Season when he was asked to read the Touch script. “I said, ‘You know what, I'm not ready to do that yet.' I wanted to set some time apart from the amazing experience I had in 24,” he said. But he did read it and committed to doing it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he liked Touch because “it was just so beautifully written.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In truth, Touch is dorky and manipulative, but the kind of beautifully made, highfalutin hokum that can succeed with aplomb on network TV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Creator Tim Kring (Heroes) actually talked about his intention “to use archetypal narrative to create and promote a positive energy in the world.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sutherland tried to steer the conversation to his role as a single dad of an autistic child in Touch, and even mentioned that he is now a grandfather who takes parenting very seriously. But Jack Bauer kept butting in. “The character [of Martin Bohm in Touch] was so vastly different, and the tone of the piece was so vastly different that that was part of its appeal,” the actor said. “I had to reread it a second time to make sure that all of the emotional components that I was reacting to so strongly were actually integral to me, as opposed to this perspective that I was trying to navigate away from 24.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the matter of autism, the show seems deeply conflicted. Jake (David Mazouz) hates to be touched and spends his existence writing down patterns of numbers. At first, he is plainly presented as an autistic child and later it appears he has mystical powers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was suggested to Kring that parents of autistic children might be confused by the creation of a mythology surrounding autism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The show does not attempt to talk about autism,” he said. “It's not a show about autism. In fact, just to give you a little background on why the character is the way he is: I sort of backed into what Jake's character was, by having just the idea of a character who had this gift to see how we were all connected. By backing into some of those ideas, we ended up with a child who, by the outside world, would be labelled or diagnosed as autistic. But in the pilot, we have a character, who is a professor, who states kind of right up front that there is a misdiagnosis going on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And, as storytellers, we want to sort of reserve the right to say that there is some other idea floating above it, something perhaps supernatural or spiritual floating above this [autism] that allows us to tell the stories that we want to tell, without having to be grounded in such reality.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This might make sense to someone creating a TV series, but it is certainly going to confuse parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 9/11 theme is also built on ambiguity. The wife of the Sutherland character died while working in the World Trade Center. He visits her grave and hears from a firefighter who tried to save her. There is a vague suggestion that Jake can rescue the world from some of the horrors of the post-9/11 world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, Kring denied that 9/11 is a “conscious metaphor.” But then he said, “The idea of 9/11 was really just as a backdrop to Martin's character and the fact that they live in New York, and he's now a single parent with a child that's very complicated. But I think the consciousness change – if there was a consciousness shift in the country after 9/11 – was this awareness that what happens ‘there' does affect us and that, you know, people from 10,000 miles away would fly planes into our building was as a result of this globally connected world. And so, in a sense, maybe 9/11 does act as a metaphor for that consciousness.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confused? Well the show is confusing, but, at the start, gorgeously so. It throbs with grand ambitions to explain the connectivity of the world. It remains to be seen if the action and mess of ideas actually connect with viewers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Sutherland, there is connectivity too. Asked how his own family supports him, he said: “I've been really fortunate. I grew up with my mother, and I have a very, very close relationship with my father now. My grandfather, my mother's father….” Here, Sutherland was interrupted by the critic saying, “Your grandfather was amazing!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He smiled and continued, “Tommy Douglas was someone I was very, very close to. I have a twin sister, who has helped me through a lot of stuff. And, oddly enough, my youngest daughter is 24. My oldest one is in her 30s. They have come around the other side and been unbelievable support systems too.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Being connected to Tommy Douglas and Donald Sutherland actually trumps anything broached in Touch. But that's a Canadian thing, right?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TruthTalk of a Glee spinoff is dead. Truth is, the show's average ratings are down 19 per cent this season. Fox entertainment president Kevin Reilly said, “There will not be a Glee spinoff, but those characters will graduate and it's led to a really interesting idea that I think is going to give us something really cool to dig into next season.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hype</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Movie actor Christian Slater made a rough transition to TV. He starred in the quickly cancelled My Own Worst Enemy for NBC and the failure The Forgotten for ABC. Then he joined the Fox comedy Breaking In, which has now been renewed. Of worrying about Breaking In being cancelled, he said: “It's like when Tinker Bell was dying and Peter Pan was saying, ‘Do you believe in fairies?' It's like, ‘I do believe;</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE QUESTION</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I read about a grassroots group in Kenya making light bulbs out of old water bottles. How do I donate directly to them?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ANSWER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This remarkable youth group, Koch Hope, has generated a lot of interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They've taken a simple, relatively new technology – an ordinary plastic water bottle filled with water and bleach that refracts sunlight equivalent to a 60-watt bulb – and brought free indoor light to hundreds of otherwise dark homes in one of Nairobi's largest slums. Now they lack the money for materials to expand their project to other neighbourhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they don't have a Canadian charitable number or a website to take donations. They don't even have a contact number that's publicly available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's attractive to donate directly to truly grassroots projects, without the middleman of government or large international organizations. These local groups are more closely in touch with their community's needs, and they don't spend your money on advertisements or fundraising. However, besides not being able to grant charitable tax receipts, they're also less likely to have audited statements, impact assessments or other formal means of oversight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For groups like Koch Hope, your options are limited to doing the legwork yourself. It starts with searching online for contact information and asking due-diligence questions; it may even require going there yourself to check it out. We have many friends who dedicate one day during their overseas holidays to visiting local charities, and then contribute regularly and directly to those communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this approach is too involved, seek out similar projects that are easier to access. For example, A Liter of Light is a well-known bottle-bulb project in the Philippines, with a website linked to the MyShelter Foundation that takes donations in U.S. dollars (http://isanglitrongliwanag.org/[http://isanglitrongliwanag.org/]).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you feel strongly about a specific grassroots group, you may help them find a Canadian charity willing to partner with them to channel donations. Partners in Health (PIH) was recognized on the ground as the most effective development group in Haiti for years before the 2010 earthquake, but there was no way to donate to them from Canada until we partnered with them just after the quake. That step made it easy for Canadians to contribute directly to PIH's exceptional work training community health workers across the ravaged country. Donating to grassroots charities overseas requires a good dose of “buyer beware,” but the impact of supporting small groups can be well worth the extra effort.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that Monday evening marked the 615th <span class="companylink">NHL</span> game of the 1,230 that make up the regular season, it's the perfect time to look at some of the surprises this most unusual year.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The full list would require a newspaper section, not a column: Sidney Crosby returns, Sidney Crosby goes; Bruce Boudreau coaches the Washington Capitals and the Anaheim Ducks in the same week; the Montreal Canadiens' language crisis; Alexander Ovechkin, superstar or journeyman; Don Cherry apologizes; old Europeans hang on – Teemu Selanne, Nicklas Lidstrom, Daniel Alfredsson, Jaromir Jagr; young Canadians surge – Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, Tyler Seguin, Claude Giroux; Joffrey Lupul connects with Phil Kessel; scoring leader Henrik Sedin's failure to garner all-star votes; Brendan Shanahan busier than Judge Judy; lovers of skill saying the red line has to come back; CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) joins PIM, GAA and GWG as significant hockey measures; Coyotes still in Phoenix …</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may be, however, that the greatest surprise of the season is just down the street and around the corner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ottawa Senators are in fifth place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You have to be careful not to make too much of that. If the three teams behind them (New Jersey, Toronto, Pittsburgh) simply won the games they are short of the Senators' total, all three would pass Ottawa in the standings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But you cannot make too little of it, either. One year ago the Senators were in freefall. Internally, they worked on a drastic plan that would have them move as many bodies as possible before the trade deadline – goaltender Brian Elliott, Mike Fisher, Chris Kelly, Jarkko Ruutu, Alex Kovalev.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then they really would get to work in the off-season, firing non-communicating coach Cory Clouston and shaking free of various contracts coming up for renewal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was presumed that general manager Bryan Murray would also be gone. If not through natural retirement – he was then 68 – then as the price for signing the underachieving Kovalev to a two-year, $10-million (U.S.) deal, and bringing in expensive but seemingly always injured defenceman Sergei Gonchar. Murray also hired Clouston, who turned the veterans off to a point where the team's best goal scorer, Dany Heatley, forced a trade that seemed decidedly in favour of the San Jose Sharks, who sent back a scorer whose hands had turned to stone and a player too often injured to judge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Murray, however, stayed. He even got a contract extension from owner Eugene Melnyk and promptly announced that all this hopeless team needed was a little “tweaking” to make it once again competitive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eyes rolled, bellies roared, heads shook. Even the ever hopeful locals predicted seasons in the wilderness and years before the Senators, Stanley Cup finalists in 2007, would see the playoffs again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, we were all wrong and perhaps today should admit to it. The Heatley trade now looks in Murray's favour, as Milan Michalek has been healthy and has 20 goals compared to Heatley's 13. Murray's new coach, Paul MacLean, has earned the trust of the veterans and the worship of the youngsters and should be an early consideration for NHL coach of the year in his rookie season. Four Senators – defenceman Erik Karlsson, Alfredsson, Michalek and Jason Spezza – led the all-star voting, and even if the voting is a bit of a farce, it shows how well liked this year's team is by locals with cellphones and laptops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most intriguing of all is how this once dismissed team comes back in third periods, something once considered nigh impossible in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>. It happened again Sunday when the Senators were down 4-2 to the Philadelphia Flyers entering the final period and stormed back to win 6-4.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third-period comebacks now become the Senators' signature for this season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's inexplicable,” Spezza says. “It's been a blast. We prefer not to have to win them in such dramatic fashion, but we'll take it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's an attitude we've had since the first day of training camp,” MacLean adds. “We want to be known as a team that plays a full game.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We want the fans to keep coming,” Karlsson says jokingly, “so we got to find a way to make it exciting.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they have, much to the surprise of a great many experts who knew so much better.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the studies shows – not surprisingly – that price-level differences are especially recalcitrant for food products that are subject to supply management or marketing boards, and for alcoholic beverages and tobacco – which are under the influence of excise taxes and provincial government monopolies.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shoppers on both sides of the Canada-U.S. border might be expected to have virtuous effects, when they shift their demand to the country that has a lower price for a particular consumer good, sooner or later eliminating the difference – after taking into account the exchange rate. One of the two papers uses a method intended to replicate “the back-of-the-envelope calculation” by which many consumers compare prices in the two countries, adjusting for the currency difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, American and Canadian prices do affect each other, but imperfectly. They move closer, but cross paths only briefly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiously, when the Canadian dollar is falling, Canadians do not suffer as much from the rise of the U.S. dollar as would be expected – and do not fully benefit from greater purchasing power when the Canadian dollar strengthens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some factors in the divergences are readily understandable from people's ordinary experience. Though most Canadians live fairly close to the U.S. border, almost all cross-border shoppers incur some transportation costs, such as gasoline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American poet Longfellow was not thinking about cross-border shopping when he originated the metaphor of ships that pass in the night; nonetheless, his image expresses the all-too-fleeting convergences of Canadian and American prices.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hearings to decide the future of the Great Bear Sea and Rainforest got off to quite a start this week. Big oil, foreign intrigue, a grassroots uprising, duelling polls, angry ministers – this one has all the makings of a blockbuster. But the fervour obscures the heart of the matter: whether and under what conditions we should permit supertankers and a bitumen pipeline in one of the last intact temperate coastal rain forests on Earth.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I suspect most Canadians would be surprised that the proposed route of the Northern Gateway pipeline bisects this ecological treasure. Pipeline proponents would rather frame this issue around developing an Asian market for oil sands bitumen – and the allegedly nefarious U.S.-based interests who would prevent us from doing so – than have a science-based debate about the real risks associated with getting it there by this route.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the peculiar Canadian paradox that we're blessed with such natural beauty and abundance that we often fail to value it. Even by our standards, however, the Great Bear is a special place. It's the only habitat in the world for the spirit bear, which is rarer than the giant panda. Humpbacks, orcas and many other species of cetaceans take advantage of this quiet cold ocean to prosper. Eagles are as plentiful as sparrows are in Canada's urban parks. And all five species of Pacific salmon are present, providing the basis for a prosperous fishery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mercifully, the communities that have been sustained by this wondrous ecosystem don't share our undervaluing of nature. B.C.'s coastal first nations know well that Great Bear's value as a functioning ecosystem dwarfs the tantalizing but fleeting promise of short-term cash from oil revenue. And they know from history what we know from traditional science: that this meticulously interconnected ecosystem is very vulnerable to disruption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A toxic event can't be ruled out, even in Enbridge's own estimation. The 1,170-kilometre pipeline would divide the rain forest, crossing countless salmon rivers. At Kitimat, toxic diluted bitumen would be loaded onto supersized tankers. Each year, more than 200 would travel through narrow fjords and into some of the world's most treacherous seas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This isn't the first time the Great Bear has been threatened. Twenty-five years ago, it was slated to be clear-cut. But, after years of conflict, a group of unlikely allies found a solution. First nations, forestry companies, NGOs, the Harper and Campbell governments and both Canadian and U.S.-based philanthropists finally came together to create a model of ecosystem management and economic development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the question of whether foreign interests can participate in the National Energy Board hearings is curious. Should we prohibit oil sands companies, the majority of which are foreign-owned and operated? It's also hypocritical, given that the industry and government has spent untold millions to lobby foreign governments, air PR campaigns in foreign markets and solicit foreign direct investment in the oil sands. The message we're sending the world is that you're free to come to Canada to exploit nature, but not to protect it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the interests of full disclosure, less than 2 per cent of our revenue came from the U.S. foundations that have been targeted by smear campaigns. We're proud to add that support to the larger contributions we receive from almost 150,000 like-minded Canadians. We're also proud to provide a platform for Canadians who care deeply about conserving nature. Most important, we're transparent about our sources and uses of revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, this debate is a red herring designed to distract. The Great Bear is globally significant. If this development were proposed for the Amazon or the Great Barrier Reef, people around the world would engage. These are irreplaceable sites and input from global citizens who care about nature should be welcome. This expectation ought to be second nature in an open society.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's another reason to boost your intake of these cardio-protective foods: flavonoids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a new study published online in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, men and women whose diets contained the most flavonoids were significantly less likely to die from heart disease or stroke. What's more, even a modest intake of these natural compounds offered protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flavonoids are bioactive compounds in fruits, vegetables, nuts, dried beans and lentils, cocoa, tea, and red wine. Flavonoids can be categorized into several classes, each class found in certain foods and having specific health properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lab studies have revealed that flavonoids have a number of positive effects on blood vessels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some – but not all – studies conducted in people have linked a high intake of flavonoids to protection against heart disease. Yet many of these studies were small and investigated only one or two classes of flavonoids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the current study, researchers from the American Cancer Society and Tufts University in Boston explored the relationship between intake of total flavonoids and seven classes of flavonoids and the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study followed 98,469 healthy men and women, average age 69, for seven years. The researchers accounted for cardiovascular risk factors such as history of high blood pressure or high cholesterol, family history of heart attack, body weight, physical activity and smoking status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Men and women who consumed the most – versus the least – flavonoids were 18 per cent less likely to die from cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five flavonoid classes – called anthocyanidins, flavanols, flavones, flavonols and proanthocyanidins – were each linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flavonoids, in particular flavones, offered substantial protection from fatal heart attack especially among women. Men and women whose diets provided the most had a 25-per-cent lower risk of dying from heart attack. Among women, the risk was reduced by 40 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Men with the highest intake of total flavonoids were also 37 per cent less likely die from stroke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those in the top flavonoid category consumed, on average, 515 milligrams of flavonoids a day, an intake that can be achieved by eating 10 daily servings of flavonoid-rich foods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Protective effects also occurred with a modest intake – 150 to 300 milligrams of flavonoids daily – suggesting that eating a relatively small amount of flavonoid-rich foods (three to six servings a day) guards against cardiovascular death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flavonoids may protect the heart in a number of ways. They act as antioxidants, decrease inflammation and inhibit the formation of blood clots. They're also thought to help regulate blood pressure by keeping arteries relaxed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While flavonoid-rich foods do appear to boost heart health, other dietary measures are important too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Limiting foods rich in saturated (animal) fat and emphasizing unsaturated fats in vegetable oils, avocado, nuts and seeds can help lower LDL (bad) cholesterol and reduce inflammation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A daily intake of 500 to 1,000 milligrams of omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil – called DHA and EPA – can make the blood less likely to form clots, reduce inflammation and protect against irregular heartbeats that cause sudden cardiac death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Eating six ounces of salmon provides roughly 500 milligrams of DHA and EPA combined.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you have high LDL cholesterol in your blood, consuming foods such as oats, oat bran, psyllium-enriched breakfast cereals, flaxseed and barley on a daily basis – foods rich in soluble fibre – can help lower cholesterol.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A regular intake of whole grains, nuts, dried beans and lentils, and, of course, fruits and vegetables also guard against heart disease by lowering blood pressure, reducing LDL cholesterol and maintaining blood-sugar levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keeping your daily sodium intake under 2,300 milligrams can keep blood pressure in check. (Adults require 1,200 to 1,500 milligrams of sodium a day.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To reduce your sodium intake, limit how often you eat restaurant meals. Reduce processed meats such as bologna, ham, sausage, hot dogs, bacon and deli meats. Rely less on convenience foods such as canned soups, frozen dinners and packaged rice and pasta mixes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regular exercise is also essential. People who are regularly active are less likely to succumb to heart disease and 20 to 30 per cent less likely to die from the disease compared to their sedentary peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Physical activity can lower blood fats (triglycerides), increase HDL (good) cholesterol, reduce blood pressure, maintain a normal blood sugar and help manage stress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help lower the risk of heart disease, aim for 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise on most days of the week. Research suggests you need to burn at least 1,000 calories each week from exercise to reap its cardio-protective effects.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With holiday merrymaking (and, one hopes, hangovers) a fading memory, moderation is on the menu in many homes. You can ban alcohol, but that penance is too severe for some of us. A more enticing solution: lower-alcohol wines. Not de-alcoholized, but bottles naturally imbued with, say, 12.5 per cent or less.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I receive disconsolate letters on the subject regularly, some from readers advised by doctors to cut back. They underscore a blunt reality: Alcohol has been creeping up during the past quarter-century – by some estimates, 1.5 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise of warm-climate regions, such as California, Southeast Australia and much of Chile and Argentina, accounts for some of the gain. Sun yields higher levels of grape sugars. Yeast feeds off sugar to produce alcohol. Blammo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fashion is another factor. Quality-oriented producers have been chasing bolder, more concentrated flavours, allowing grapes to hang longer on the vine in autumn. In many cases, they prune more assiduously to coax vines into faster ripening. Again, more sugar, more ethanol.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alcohol-wary consumers are not always simply minding health or road safety. That extra percentage or two can taste hot, even medicinal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When it's above 14 per cent, it has a burning sensation in your mouth,” said Hennie van Vuuren, director of the Wine Research Centre and the Eagles Chair in Biotechnology at the University of British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. van Vuuren adds that one of the best wines he has enjoyed, Château Lafite from the legendary 1961 Bordeaux vintage, tipped the scales at a mere 10.5 per cent. “I can drink almost a barrel without getting intoxicated,” he quipped, though such a barrel today would be valued at more than a typical university-research grant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lafite's 2010 vintage, by the way, weighed in at 13.5 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a double-edged sword, though. Grapes that have failed to ripen physiologically yield bitter flavours. This is especially noticeable in reds, which derive much of their structure from potentially astringent tannins, solid particles present in skins, seeds and stems. “Green” tannins are the bugbear of red winemaking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maturation is a delicate dance. In warm regions, sugar levels accelerate ahead of physiological ripening, forcing producers to push for longer hang times to weed out the green. By the time those tannins soften, sugars can enter the danger zone. Presto: 15-per-cent alcohol.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's less of a problem in the best, cooler-climate vineyards, notably in Europe, where, for complex reasons linked not just to weather but also to soil composition, physiological ripeness can be achieved in a 12.5-per-cent wine that won't fry brains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fear of frying may be the root of a more insidious industry practice: the tendency to understate alcohol levels. In a study of 91,432 wines from vineyards around the world produced during a 16-year period, researchers found last year that 57.1 per cent contained more alcohol than stated on the label. Among those, the average alcohol was 13.6 per cent versus a declared average of 13.1 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Incidentally, the study, published by the American Association of Wine Economists and co-written in part by George Soleas, senior vice-president of logistics and quality assurance at the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, based its findings on wines sold in Ontario. The reason? Ontario is one of the few jurisdictions to test alcohol on every product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lowball reporting is largely legal because various governments permit significant latitude between fact and fiction. The LCBO permits a tolerance of plus or minus one percentage point for wines at less than 14 per cent; for higher-alcohol wines, it's plus or minus 0.5. In the United States, a producer can understate by as much as 1.5 percentage points. That's a substantial error margin, deceptively placing many wines in the hot, head-numbing zone – it's like secretly adding roughly half a glass of wine to every bottle you think you've consumed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on informal discussions with winemakers, the study's authors reported that some “admitted that they deliberately chose to understate the alcohol content on a wine label, within the range of error permitted by the law, because they believed that it would be advantageous for marketing the wine to do so.” In other words, Château Fruit Bomb believes that consumers are turned off by big alcohol. (Another incentive for distortion: Wines with more than 14 per cent generally are charged a higher tax rate.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other questionable practices are taking root to assuage consumer fear. Some producers resort to such technologies as reverse osmosis and spinning cones to extract alcohol, but these tweaks can yield off-balance wines. Then there's the blunt garden-hose method: adding water, which is illegal in many regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Decry high-octane reds we may, but there is one advantage to excessive alcohol (besides the fact that it can make Ashton Kutcher's lines in Two and a Half Men sound funny). “It binds the free water in the wine and enhances the body,” Dr. van Vuuren said. “The wine becomes more viscous.” Velvety bombs are prized by many consumers, not to mention wine critics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if you're moderation-inclined, I'd suggest looking to regions and grapes that tend toward demure alcohol levels. White wines are generally harvested earlier and tend to have lower alcohol levels than reds. Off-dry whites, usually bottled before yeasts have converted all the sugar to alcohol, have among the lowest. Cool regions with shorter growing seasons are an especially fertile field. Think Canada, cooler vineyards of France (especially the Loire Valley, but also Bordeaux), northeast Italy (home of Valpolicella) and Germany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain styles are also worth exploring, such as sparkling wine, whose grapes tend to be harvested early, Australian semillon, vinho verde from Portugal and moscato d'Asti, a lightly sweet Italian white with about 5 to 6 per cent alcohol.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The accompanying sidebar lists a few selections I enjoyed recently. But don't take my word for the alcohol levels; I'm just going by the labels.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contrary to popular belief, these may not be the last days of Martin Brodeur's distinguished NHL career, in which he has recorded more wins and more shutouts than any goaltender in history, and every night he plays, he adds to that expansive body of work.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brodeur will turn 40 in May, and the prevailing wisdom going into the season was that with his contract expiring and his workload shrinking from its peak years, this may be his swan song as the New Jersey Devils' goalie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turns out Brodeur isn't thinking retirement thoughts at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I've asked a lot of people about that,” Brodeur said in an interview Tuesday, “and the common theme is: When you quit, it's over, there's no coming back, so if they want you and you feel you can do it, then go for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's funny, because I've asked a lot of players, a lot of who are enjoying their retirement, but you know what? They all say they wish they could have maybe played another season. That makes me think, maybe I can stick around, if they still want me. So we'll see.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, every win Brodeur clicks off – it was 637 and counting going into New Jersey's game against the Calgary Flames here on Tuesday night – just puts more distance between himself and Patrick Roy atop the NHL goalie career wins list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brodeur and Roy had the luxury of playing in an era in which there are no ties, which undermined the win totals of goalies from the Terry Sawchuk-Glenn Hall-Jacques Plante era.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Brodeur has been so good for so long and so healthy that however many victories he ends up with, it is hard to imagine anyone ever dislodging him from the top spot on the list. Among active goaltenders, Nikolai Khabibulin (327) of the Edmonton Oilers and Roberto Luongo (325) of the Vancouver Canucks are next, but miles behind. Luongo, who turns 32 in April, would need to average 37?1/2? wins a season for the next eight seasons to reel in Brodeur. Unlikely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The big thing with him, as with a lot of superstars, is consistency, year in and year out,” said Calgary Flames centre Brendan Morrison, who broke into the NHL with Brodeur in the Devils' organization. “When you look at the goaltending position, demeanour is such a key. With him, he has that cool, calm demeanour. He doesn't get rattled, and when you have that in your net, it filters through the whole team. When your goaltender is confident and he's feeling it and you know he's going to make the big saves, that just energizes the team.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brodeur said he's had to adjust his habits to account for more nights on the bench this season – backup Johan Hedberg is getting about 40 per cent of the playing time. In practices, Brodeur actually practises now. Sitting on the bench, when he gets a night off, he enjoys watching the Devils' Kiddie Corps play – Adam Henrique, Adam Larsson and all the pieces of the rebuilding puzzle that general manager Lou Lamoriello has added in the past 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Devils have missed the playoffs twice in Brodeur's career – in 1996, after their Stanley Cup win, and then again last season, when they dug themselves such an early hole that their extraordinary second-half push came up just short. It was no way to end a career, so Brodeur returned and said the difficulties might have been a blessing in disguise for New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Sometimes, it takes that, for an organization to kind of regroup,” Brodeur said. “We discovered players that maybe, if we'd had success, maybe they would never have had a chance to play with us.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At midseason, the Devils were sixth in the tightly bunched Eastern Conference standings and would draw the Florida Panthers in the opening round if the playoffs began now. New Jersey hasn't won a playoff series since 2007, the victims of multiple first-round upsets over that span. It gives Brodeur hope – that if they get in, anything can happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This year, you've got Vancouver, you've got Boston, you've got the Rangers right now playing really well, but it's really a coin toss,” he said. “You come to these towns now and you feel you can beat anybody, or you can get beat by anybody, too. You've got to go and play every night. That's what makes it fun.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What would make it even more fun would be to get a game against a genuinely bad NHL team. Brodeur has been playing long enough to remember when parity wasn't part of the NHL's vocabulary, and there really were soft touches on the schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brodeur laughed at the memory. “Yeah, that was fun. Without taking a day off, it was almost like getting a day off. The games of eight, 10 or 12 shots [against] are long gone for us.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For everybody else, too.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been rich, even comic, to listen to the Harper government blasting away at “foreign money,” “radical groups” and Hollywood movie stars for interfering in the environmental review of the Northern Gateway pipeline that's just starting.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, such people and their money have entered the fray in Canada. It isn't the first time (think of U.S. interventions against cutting old-growth forests in B.C.) and it won't be the last. We live in a global world, and we share a continent with the U.S. (and Mexico) where one country's decisions can affect the continent and planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think back to last year, and the ones before that. <span class="companylink">TransCanada Pipelines</span> sought U.S. approval for the Keystone XL pipeline to ship oil from Alberta's tar sands to Gulf of Mexico refineries. Regulatory hearings were required. Ultimately, the State Department (read: President Barack Obama's administration) had to decide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To influence U.S. opinion, both at the level of legislators and the general public, Canadian companies poured untold millions into the fray. They papered Washington with lobbyists, including someone who was once high up in Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's campaign for the Democratic nomination and two former U.S. ambassadors to Canada. The Harper government put Canada's entire diplomatic apparatus in the U.S. behind the Keystone campaign. The Prime Minister himself went to the U.S. and declared approval of Keystone a “no-brainer.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These “radicals” (that is, Canadian business-at-any-cost types) and their “foreign money” intervened directly in the U.S. regulatory and political processes, as “foreign” interests often do to further their economic advantage. So to hear Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver and Prime Minister Stephen Harper railing against “foreign” (read: American) intervention in the Gateway hearings is, shall we say, a bit rich. What's sauce for the goose really should be sauce for the gander.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Harper government also took great public offence at the Obama administration's decision to delay its verdict on Keystone pending further environmental studies in Nebraska, despite proponents changing the route. Mr. Harper hinted darkly that, if Americans didn't want Canada's oil, then someone else – presumably the Chinese – would.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration's decision was correctly interpreted by the Harper government as being all about U.S. presidential politics. Environmentalists had been very pro-Obama in the last election, and they'd been disappointed by his record. The Keystone delay was largely about appeasing them, however temporarily. How shocking!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About as shocking as the Harper government's rejection of <span class="companylink">BHP Billiton</span>'s proposed takeover of <span class="companylink">Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan</span>. For a government committed to an open-door policy for foreign investment, whose Foreign Investment Review Agency had been a paper tiger under the Conservatives, what could possibly have persuaded the Harper government to reject the BHP takeover, and at the last moment?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Politics, of course. The then-minority Conservatives, facing an election, feared losing up to half a dozen seats in Saskatchewan. To save them, the Harper government swallowed its principles and stiffed BHP. How shocking!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government rightly decries the length of some environmental hearings. But the opposition to the Gateway pipeline isn't largely foreign inspired. That argument is a hypocritical diversion – hypocritical, given Canadian interventions in U.S. decisions. The main opposition comes from the multiplicity of aboriginal groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Energy Board will eventually rubber-stamp the project. It always does, but not until years of hearings – unless the Harper government changes the legislation. Even then, legal challenges will go all the way to the Supreme Court. That court has issued an opaque ruling obliging governments and private interests to consult aboriginals before using land to which they've claimed title.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since B.C. aboriginals have claimed the entire province, sometimes with overlapping claims, and since the B.C. commission supposed to settle land claims has been almost a total bust, the Gateway pipeline has entered the impenetrable thickets of aboriginal politics, title and law – meaning it won't be built for a very long time, if at all.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's nothing like the salaries of hospital presidents to get the public riled, especially when there are perks such as cosmetic surgery, golf-club memberships, weight-loss programs and car allowances – and when medicare resources are perennially stretched. Hospital CEO salaries should not be capped, but they should be set according to a sensible framework.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, Ontario hospitals became subject to Freedom of Information laws. Most of them pre-emptively posted details on their websites. Though total compensation has been known for some time through a so-called sunshine list – with one CEO's package coming in at just over $750,000 – all sorts of new nuggets were revealed, including an annual $100,000 pension top-up.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the spring, the provincial government moved to ban some of these privileges, such as season's tickets to cultural and sporting events, access to private health clinics and tax planning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During this critical time when hospitals are being merged and exceptional change agents are needed to take them to the next level, salary caps would be a mistake. But Ontario is wrong-headed in letting each hospital's board determine compensation guidelines and standards for executives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, CEO pay in British Columbia, for example, is determined through a compensation plan administered by the Health Employers' Association of B.C. The government must approve any adjustments to the plan. The CEO of Fraser Health Authority is the highest paid, with total compensation of about $461,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario ought to develop a compensation framework, as an independent expert panel has recommended; the Ontario Hospital Association is moving toward such a system, expected in early March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A good framework would provide some consistency to compensation. It would require that a more significant portion of executive pay be dependent on attaining performance indicators – what is often called “at-risk pay.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think getting up to 30 per cent [of at-risk pay] is where you ultimately need to get,” says Tom Closson, the president of the Ontario Hospital Association. At some smaller hospitals, however, the amounts are as little as 3 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hospitals should move to tie a significant amount of CEO pay to performance. After all, patients and taxpayers deserve to know where their money is going.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The garage is a utilitarian wonder, a concrete box standing seven storeys tall on a downtown Vancouver street corner. An interior series of ramps winds to the rooftop, where painted stalls provide room for yet another 58 automobiles.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From that roof one can marvel at the neo-classical beauty of Waterfront Station across West Cordova Street, as well as the mixed art deco and Edwardian Baroque magnificence of the Sinclair Centre across Granville Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is much better to be in the garage looking out than to be outside looking in. The garage, built in 1969, is an ugly, dreary blot on the landscape. The garage's opened façade is like a grim stack of grey concrete pancakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site was not always so unwelcoming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once, a strip of mom-and-pop businesses operated on the block. A photograph taken during the war years depicts well-dressed couples strolling past businesses with opened doors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two images – the sterile parking garage and the vibrant street of shops – are paired in a fascinating new blog called Changing Vancouver. The site matches then and now photographs taken at the exact same location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launched on Christmas Day, the blog – at changingvancouver.wordpress.com – already has more than 50 entries complete with historical background and information on architects and builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is an irresistible time waster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blog is produced by Andy Coupland, a London-born city hall planner, and John Atkin, the historian and heritage advocate. It is a follow-up to The Changing City, their book of walking tours published last year by Stellar Press.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contemporary photographs are shot by Mr. Coupland (pronounced coop-land), who strolls city sidewalks armed with a digital camera, a tripod and a wallet of black-and-white prints as he seeks the precise spot where the historical photographs were taken. It is not as easy a task as it sounds and even somewhat hazardous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A lot of them were set up standing in the middle of traffic,” he said. “That is quite problematic.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, the before-and-after images are surprisingly similar. (A trio of buildings facing the northeast corner of Victory Square remains intact.) Other times, it is hard to imagine what has forever disappeared. That ordinary, ho-hum, never-give-it-a-second-glance Standard Life Building office tower at Howe and Dunsmuir? It stands on ground once occupied by the many-gabled Manor House Hotel, which boasted a wraparound porch on all three levels, as well as a bell tower overlooking the intersection. The Manor House was designed by William Blackmore, a British-born architect who skipped debts in Winnipeg and Minneapolis to set up practice in Vancouver a year after the city was founded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the blog's most shocking contrasts is the pairing of today's parking garage with yesterday's modest shops at the corner of Granville and Cordova.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That single storey is so much more interesting than the parking garage,” Mr. Coupland said. “It's interesting how busy that corner used to be, and how dead it is now.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that one block, now relegated to memory, can be told the story of a city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along Granville Street could be found a lunch counter and an office of the Railway Express Agency, which shipped parcels. There was also a barber shop operated by James Willows; the Wigwam novelty store offering native crafts and Japanese porcelain; and a furrier. The corner was occupied by Wilson's, described as the Post Office News Stand in the city directory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A star-shaped neon sign advertised the Star Weekly magazine, while other exterior signs promoted <span class="companylink">Coca-Cola</span> and Sweet Caporal cigarettes. The newsstand is open to both Granville and Cordova Streets, attracting customers from the train station (now Waterfront Station) and the post office (now Sinclair Centre).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The adjacent fur store was founded by the Lando family. Lou and Sara Lando's son, Esmond (Bud) Lando became a prominent lawyer and sportsman in the city, while his wife, Edith, was named to the Order of Canada as a “quintessential volunteer.” Their children are known for their own volunteer and philanthropic work. One of them, Barry Lando, worked for a quarter-century as a producer on CBS's 60 Minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of which is more interesting than a parking garage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the blog has so far used archival photos, Mr. Atkin is dipping into his extensive collection of private, never-before-seen photos dating from more recent decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among these is a 1962 shot of the Courtesy Kitchen, serving Chinese and Canadian food, at the corner of East Broadway and Scotia. Next door, a one-time foresters hall houses a shop selling foam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, both buildings have survived. The former Courtesy Kitchen is now home to the pleasant Rhizome Café, while the foam store, which has also been a confectionery, a print shop and a strip joint, is home to <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least it was the last time I checked. In Vancouver, you never know what's going to be there in the morning.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitt Romney survived damaging 11th-hour attacks on his business record to handily win the New Hampshire Republican primary Tuesday, solidifying his status as the candidate most likely to carry the party banner against President Barack Obama in November.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Provided Mr. Romney's eight-vote margin of victory in the Iowa caucuses holds, which now appears likely, he will have become the only non-incumbent Republican presidential candidate to have won both initial nomination contests in New Hampshire and Iowa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That piece of history becomes even more significant considering no candidate has lost both of those early contests and gone on to win the nomination, creating even more daunting odds for Mr. Romney's challengers as the pack heads for South Carolina.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Romney's margin of victory was narrower than polls had predicted only days ago, while libertarian Texas Congressman Ron Paul showed startling strength, about 24 per cent of all votes cast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paul, who draws much of his support among newly politicized college students, was favoured by the ability of independent voters to cast a ballot in the state's GOP primary. Most other states do not allow that, making it harder for Mr. Paul to do as well elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ex-Utah-governor Jon Huntsman came in third at 17 per cent, a respectable result, but likely not enough to give him the momentum to break through nationally. Former House speaker Newt Gingrich and ex-senator Rick Santorum each got only 10 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Romney's victory, with about 38 per cent of the vote, comes with caveats. He failed to crack the 40-per-cent mark despite holding every advantage in the Granite State, where he maintains a second home and moderate Republicans dominate the primary electorate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he ended the campaign defending himself against stinging attacks on his record as a corporate buy-out mogul. Suddenly, the core theme of his candidacy – that his business experience would make him a good president – also underscores his vulnerability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The clash in New Hampshire over Mr. Romney's business background presages an ugly battle in South Carolina, where Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Santorum and Texas Governor Rick Perry are all vying to become the anti-Romney candidate in the state's Jan. 21 primary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evangelical Christians account for more than half of likely Republican primary voters in South Carolina and Mr. Gingrich launched a television ad there on Tuesday arguing that Mr. Romney “can't be trusted” to stand up against abortion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, an independent group supporting Mr. Gingrich has started a massive $3.4-million ad campaign that savages Mr. Romney as a “predatory corporate raider,” drawing material from a devastating anti-Romney Web documentary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That dovetails with Mr. Gingrich's own accusation that Mr. Romney spent his career at <span class="companylink">Bain Capital</span> “looting” businesses without regard for the fate of their workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If we identify capitalism with rich guys looting companies, we're going to have a very hard time protecting it,” Mr. Gingrich told Fox News on Tuesday. “This is why you have this underlying anger about the financial class.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gingrich may have no greater goal than fratricide. But by putting modern capitalism on trial he may have also set off a civil war within the Republican Party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic populism has traditionally been the purview of Democrats, from Andrew Jackson's dismantling of the Second Bank of the United States in the 1830s to Mr. Obama's characterization of income inequality as the “defining issue of our time.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gingrich appears to want to make it a tenet of Republicanism, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purposely or not, he has aggravated an emerging fault line within the Republican Party that pits the economic populism of the Tea Party against the corporate capitalism of the GOP establishment and its Chamber of Commerce allies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This kind of existential conflict is hardly promising for a party eyeing the White House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the same Republican kingmakers who have been skeptical of Mr. Romney's moderation came to his defence on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Club for Growth, a free-market lobby group whose endorsement is coveted, called Mr. Gingrich's attacks “disgusting.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radio host Rush Limbaugh accused Mr. Gingrich of “using the language of the left,” while the National Review called the ex-speaker's outbursts “foolish and destructive.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Gingrich is not entirely in left field, so to speak. White working-class voters with little or no college education are the mainstay of the modern GOP, not Wall Street or Fortune 500 CEOs. Speaking to their economic fears is critical to the party's success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gingrich's outbursts should be a reminder to Mr. Romney's high-paid campaign consultants that their candidate needs a more effective rebuttal against a line of attack that, if it does not stop him from winning the nomination, could doom him in November.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are few things more satisfying than the aroma of a stew bubbling gently in the oven. The most soothing of foods, stews are also one of the easiest to prepare. Plus, they freeze well, reheat beautifully and are even better after a couple of days.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Braising and stewing are interchangeable terms; both mean long, slow cooking in liquid, usually in the oven, to ensure even heat. The result is rich, saucy and tender. The quintessential peasant food – the rich got the best cuts and roasted them, the poor ended up with the tough ones – stews are a staple in all cultures. Today, stews are considered comfort food at its finest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tips</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best cuts for stewing are the tougher ones, which have more flavour and texture than tender cuts. A long, slow cooking in liquid makes them tender and tasty. More expensive meat does not mean better stews (tender cuts will dry out more easily). The best cuts for stewing are beef chuck, shoulder, shanks, brisket and short ribs; veal shoulder and breast; pork shoulder; lamb shoulder, shank and breast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Choose the right pot. Too large a pot and the gravy will evaporate too quickly; too small and the meat will cook unevenly. Cubed stewing meat should be arranged in two layers, while one piece of meat should fit snugly inside the pot. A Dutch oven is perfect for braising as it goes from the top of the stove into the oven. If you don't have a Dutch oven, start in a skillet and transfer to an ovenproof casserole for baking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pat the meat dry with paper towels so that the cooking oil does not spatter. Trim off most of the fat from the meat and cut the meat into uniform pieces for even cooking. Vegetables should also be cut to uniform size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heat a film of vegetable or olive oil on high heat until smoking, salt and pepper the meat and add a few pieces at a time. Don't crowd the pot while browning – the heat will be lowered, causing the meat to release its juices and produce steam, resulting in a greyish, flat stew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remove the meat with a slotted spoon and reserve. If all the oil has been soaked up, add more and reheat before continuing to brown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the meat is browned, lower the heat to medium and add aromatic vegetables and herbs to the pot to sauté. Add liquid, making sure there is enough to come halfway up the meat. Do not immerse the meat totally in liquid, or the gravy will be thin and tasteless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liquid can vary from beef stock to tomato juice to wine. Different liquids give different flavoured gravies. Don't use water – it makes weak gravy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are various methods of thickening stews, such as adding flour to the oil after the vegetables are browned and cooked until pale gold. Arrowroot or potato starch can be mixed together with water, then stirred into the stew when it is finished cooking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other methods include boiling down the stewing liquid to thicken naturally, which works well if you have a low-sodium or homemade stock to control the salt. And finally by puréeing the original vegetables cooked with the meat, then stirring back into the liquid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Use gentle heat to cook the meat slowly; 300 F to 325 F is perfect for stews. Turning the heat up will not make the stew cook more quickly, and it will toughen the fibres of the meat. You'll know the meat is cooked when it can be pierced with a fork – usually about 2½ to three hours for beef, 1½ to two hours for lamb and pork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vegetables such as potatoes, carrots and whole pearl onions can be added about 45 minutes before the meat is cooked. More tender vegetables such as zucchini, cabbage, mushrooms or peas are added about 15 minutes before the end of cooking time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEEF à LA PROVENÇAL</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is similar to beef bourguignon, the classic beef stew cooked in red wine. It parts company with tradition when the garnish is whole cooked cloves of garlic and firm green olives instead of onions and mushrooms. Cook it the day before so that you can skim the fat. (The flavours deepen with the extra time as well.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Prep time: 45 minutes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Cooking time: 2½ to 3 hours</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Ready in: 3 hours, 45 minutes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ingredients</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2 cups red wine</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2 pounds (1 kilogram) stewing beef, cut into 2-inch cubes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Salt and freshly ground pepper</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3 tablespoons olive oil or vegetable oil</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 cup sliced carrot</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 cup sliced onion</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3 cups beef or chicken stock</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 tablespoon tomato paste</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 bay leaf</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">½ teaspoon dried thyme</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2 tablespoons butter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2 headsgarlic broken into cloves</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">¼ cup pitted green olives</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2 tablespoons chopped parsley</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Method</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preheat oven to 300 F degrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Place wine in pot on high heat. Bring to boil and reduce wine by about two-thirds. It should be slightly syrupy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dry the beef in paper towels. Season well with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons oil on high heat in ovenproof casserole dish. Sauté meat, a few pieces at a time, in the hot oil until nicely browned on all sides. Add more oil as needed. Remove to dish and reserve. Pour off all fat except for 2 tablespoons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reduce heat to medium, add carrot and onion and sauté until slightly golden, about 5 minutes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stir in the reduced wine and stock. Add tomato paste, bay leaf and thyme. Bring to simmer on top of the stove. Return meat. Cover the casserole dish and set in lower third of preheated oven. Regulate heat up or down so liquid simmers very slowly for about 3 hours. The meat is done when a fork pierces it easily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Place garlic cloves in pot of cold water. Bring to boil and boil for 3 minutes or until garlic is softened slightly. Remove garlic and slip off skins. Add garlic to stew after it has cooked for 2 hours. When meat is tender, cool and chill overnight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remove fat and bring to boil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If sauce is not thick enough simmer for a few minutes while it reduces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Add olives and boil for 2 to 3 minutes, or until well flavoured and slightly thickened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garnish with parsley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Serves 4 to 6</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEPPI'S PICKS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saline green olives bobbing in a savoury, aromatic liquid – the combination reminds me of a martini, and I like that. But if you're keen to serve guests a cocktail before sitting down to eat, consider an aperitif more popular in southern France, pastis – anise-flavoured liqueur, such as Pernod or Ricard, on ice with a splash of water. The clear yellow liquid goes cloudy and stimulates the palate for a hearty meal. As an accompaniment to the stew, there could be no better wine than a gutsy, herbal red from southern France, such as Minervois, Saint Chinian or Corbières, all affordable at roughly $12 to $18. Côtes du Rhône, also full-bodied and often with a herbal nuance, works well, too. From the New World, peppery, plummy syrah would add aromatic lift.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What can the federal Conservatives, Canada's governing party, learn from the decline of the federal Liberals from “natural governing party” to third-party status?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One lesson worth considering is this: When you're the governing party, especially for a long time, you begin to rely more and more on the civil service and taxpayer dollars for everything – including the key elements required to keep your party vigorous, strong and relevant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does your party need intellectual capital – a steady stream of policy analysis and ideas? As the governing party, you can always expropriate some of it from your political opponents. But the longer you are in office, the more likely you are to get an increasing proportion of your intellectual capital from the civil service or by the use of taxpayer dollars to fund research projects and policy studies on any subject.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does your party need trained human resources to help guide and run your political machinery as well as the government? You can get and maintain those resources by placing persons sympathetic to your partisan cause in political staff positions within the government and funded by the taxpayer. You can upgrade their knowledge and skills from time to time by sending them on courses or bringing in training consultants, again at taxpayer expense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can even use the civil service itself as a reservoir of potential candidates for elected office – the Liberal Party of Canada, for example, drawing two of its most prominent leaders, Mackenzie King and Lester Pearson, from the civil service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does your party need ever-expanding communications capacity to get out its messages? The party itself will have a small communications staff, but, if you're the governing party, you can increasingly draw on the communications offices of 30 government departments and dozens of Crown corporations and agencies to help craft and deliver your key messages, again all at taxpayer expense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then, alas, the fateful day comes – as it did for the Liberal Party of Canada – when you're no longer the governing party. No longer do you have access to the intellectual capital-generating capacities of the civil service. No longer do you have access to the human resources and training budgets of a $265-billion-a-year taxpayer-funded enterprise. No longer do you have access to the hundreds of communications personnel and vehicles that were once at your beck and call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make matters worse, during the long years as government, most of the alternative sources of these resources were neglected and allowed to atrophy. Thus, the Liberals now find their party intellectually bankrupt, lacking in the ability to attract and nourish talented people, and its once-loud voice reduced to a whimper because of drastically reduced communications capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our advice to our political friends? Build and maintain your “democratic political infrastructure” – the intellectual capital generators for politicians, the training programs for political activists, and the political communications vehicles – when in opposition but continue to build and maintain it, outside of the civil service and through private donations, even after becoming the governing party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To fail to do so is to court eventual political collapse and impotence from which it may take years, even decades, to recover – witness the current state of the federal Liberals.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PASADENA, CALIF. -- jdoyle@globeandmail.com</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We, the gathered TV critics, are here to talk about TV shows and the TV racket, not celebrities. But sometimes the celebrity thing gets in the way. Let me explain.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in the summer when this TV-critics-on-tour thing took place in the environs of Beverly Hills, Calif., I was kinda smitten. This sort of thing happens all the time in the 90212, as the whole world knows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was smitten with New Girl and the show's star, Zooey Deschanel. Yeah, me and millions of other people. The pilot episode was a small masterpiece of silliness. Deschanel played Jess, a gal with a broken heart who moved into an apartment with three guys and everybody tried to be nice to each other. If you didn't see it, no point in explaining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, stuff happened. New Girl debuted to great ratings. An instant hit. Lots of people fell for it and a small handful of ridiculously grumpy critics hated it. The show quickly evolved. It became less about Jess and more about the guys she lived with – Schmidt (Max Greenfield) the guy who thinks he's hot and keeps taking off his shirt; Nick (Jake Johnson) who is all brokenhearted and sweet, and Winston (Lamorne Morris) the athlete who is easily bored. All hilarious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other stuff that happened included Deschanel separating from her husband of two years, filing for divorce and having her finances splashed all over the entertainment news. Oh, and several Golden Globe nominations for New Girl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On this TV-critics-on-tour thing we are ensconced in the more sedate environs of Pasadena. No matter where we are, the central rule holds – we talk to the stars about the show, not about their personal lives. And they talk to us about the shows, not their lives, messy or otherwise. It's don't ask, don't tell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus it was peculiar to watch things unfold over a 24-hour period on Sunday and Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zooey Deschanel turned up three times in that period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, Fox organized a panel of people from three sitcoms: New Girl, Raising Hope and Breaking In. Actors and creators sat and joshed for an hour. Deschanel and New Girl creator Liz Meriwether, who appear to be joined at the hip, talked about the Golden Globe nomination. Deschanel said she had slept in and missed the news. But she's looking forward to Sunday's awards event and has no fear of zingers from host Ricky Gervais. “I can't wait. I worship Ricky Gervais, and I can't wait to hear any insults that he might have. Him insulting me is the best problem I could possibly get.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday evening Deschanel was at the Fox party along with several of her co-stars. She had her photo taken on the red carpet. “Zooey Deschanel Doing Well Post Divorce” was the caption on one celebrity-obsessed website. “Zooey Looks Adorable” said another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the party, Deschanel talked to the critics for a few minutes and essentially said she was totally enjoying New Girl. That's it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday afternoon most of the critics got on a bus and went to the sprawling Fox lot where we visited the set of New Girl. Deschanel wielded a microphone and showed us around. She took us into Jess's room and showed us the unfinished knitting project that Jess was working on. She told us she does some knitting too and sympathized with Jess for not getting it finished. Everybody thought that was way cute. Which it was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about how much she and other actors contribute to the show's script and humour, Deschanel said, “We're allowed to be actors and contribute. And I think it's not always that way. I think a lot of actors feel, you know, stifled. And this is such an open atmosphere. We have so much freedom. We're allowed to play and have fun. And it's a wonderful atmosphere to work in.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While all of these press events unfolded for the critics, Deschanel's personal life was the subject of fevered discussion in other media. Apparently when her lawyer filed for her divorce from husband Ben Gibbard (from the band Death Cab for Cutie), he included papers that revealed her finances and expenses for the world to see. So anyone who is curious – and many are, judging by the copious coverage – knows that the actor makes about $95,000 (U.S.) a month, has expenses averaging $22,550 a month. And she has three credit cards, AmEx, Visa and Mastercard, all of which have a zero balance. In her bank account she has $1,578,000. She has stocks and bonds worth $1,645,000 and personal property valued at $693,300. She drops $1,000 on groceries and household supplies a month, spends $500 eating out and $800 on utilities. Her monthly phone bill is $300. She also donates $1,500 a month to charity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The detail is highly unusual and her lawyer probably made the document public entirely by accident. But the info is out there. Deschanel is being called “thrifty” all over the place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet over those 24 hours and all the encounters with us, nobody asked her about the divorce or her personal finances. Nobody.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the visit to the set, the bus was stuck in traffic. It took hours to get back to Pasadena. Some of us chatted. A fellow critic told me that after that comedy panel on Sunday he'd been waiting for a word with Deschanel. Another reporter got there first. After asking something about the Jess character, the reporter also asked, bizarrely, if Deschanel had “dating tips” she wished to impart. Deschanel stared at her, said nothing, turned around and walked away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's fine. That's the way it should be. Don't ask, don't tell on Zooey Deschanel. There might be an elephant in the room as far as some media are concerned, but we are, after all, critics.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INSIDE THE TV RACKET</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Truth</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Lawrence, co-creator and producer of the ABC show Cougar Town, is miffed that ABC has put the show on hiatus, reduced the number of episodes airing this season and been vague about a return date. So he crashed the TV Critics Tour. Lawrence threw a cocktail part for critics in the hotel bar the night before ABC's presentation, bringing cast members Courteney Cox, Busy Philipps and Christa Miller. Asked if he might be annoying ABC, Lawrence said he didn't care – “I think you could run over someone's dog, but if you have something that's worth money they'll put it on [the air] the next day.”</p>

But the regulatory process should go ahead and hear all concerns in an evenhanded way, as that process was designed to do. The federal government's warnings about foreign influences and “environmental and other radical groups” are exaggerated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada needs to trade with diverse markets, and China will have a huge appetite for oil for a long time to come. The pipeline, transporting petroleum from the Alberta oil sands to Kitimat, B.C., where it can be loaded on to ocean tankers, would serve the Asian market. Better access to international markets (not only through Gateway) could add $131-billion to this country's gross domestic product between 2016 and 2030, and $27-billion in tax revenues, a paper published by the University of Calgary's School of Policy studies argues.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver was circumspect when he spoke with this newspaper's editorial board in late October. He did not specifically endorse the pipeline, but said he would respect the regulatory process evaluating the project. Now, though, as that evaluation is beginning in B.C., he denounced “environmental and other radical groups” who “threaten to hijack our regulatory system to achieve their radical ideological agenda.” They “use funding from foreign special interest groups to undermine Canada's national economic interest,” he said in an open letter. They even, if all else fails, “will take a quintessential American approach: sue everyone and anyone to delay the project even further.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this noise about foreign money, U.S. special interests and the U.S. approach of using the courts – it almost sounds like anti-Americanism. It's a bogeyman, though not terribly frightening. There is no reason to think the independent panel reviewing the pipeline will be hijacked. In fact, any sign that people are not given a fair chance to be heard would make court action all the more likely to succeed. There are legitimate concerns about oil tankers and the possibility of a spill. The government should respect the process enough not to heap scorn on the participants.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Darryl Sutter is on the phone from Los Angeles, in advance of his big homecoming this weekend, talking about cows. Sutter is a rancher, whenever he can take time away from hockey, and on Sunday night, he and brother Brent were discussing their herds and how it's calving season. Worryingly, there are some calcium deficiencies in the stock.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was just one part of the conversation between the two Sutter brothers, as they touched base to compare notes on hockey, family, ranching and other matters. That they will be coaching against each other for the first time in their respective careers on Saturday, when Darryl's Los Angeles Kings visit Brent's Calgary Flames, seemed to be an afterthought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Darryl's primary motivation in calling was to congratulate Brent on Calgary's big win over the Minnesota Wild, which came two days after a monstrously bad 9-0 loss to the Boston Bruins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I said to him, ‘Geez you go from getting pounded by Boston to having a 3-0 lead with just a few minutes left – that's a testament to good coaching.'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, the much-anticipated Sutter vs. Sutter match-up Saturday will be the 32nd time in his life that Darryl has coached against one of his brothers, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Twenty-nine came against Brian, two against Duane. In 1997, almost 15 years ago, it happened under oddly similar circumstances – Darryl coming to Calgary for the first time with a California-based team (the San Jose Sharks), with Brian behind the Flames' bench.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Darryl last coached in the NHL with the Flames, before becoming the full-time general manager in 2007. He left the organization just a little more than a year ago, officially resigning so that Jay Feaster could take over. When the Kings fired coach Terry Murray last December, general manager Dean Lombardi asked Sutter, with whom he worked before in San Jose, to take over. The Kings are 6-1-3 in Darryl's first 10 games behind the bench, and has crept back into a playoff position in the tightly bunched Western Conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sutter never did speak publicly about his departure from Calgary, but on Wednesday, he said the perception that he bore a grudge against the organization was untrue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Absolutely not,” Sutter said. “You know what? I almost feel today exactly as I did when I first went there – that it's a privilege for a guy, being from Alberta, to coach and manage one of those teams. It's awesome.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a family with seven boys, six of whom made it to the NHL, the Sutters have long ago figured out how to separate family matters from the inherent competitive fires that run through them all, according to Darryl. It'll be the same this weekend, too. “We were always like that,” Sutter said. “As players, we could see each other the night before, but the day of, we never even looked at each other. Usually, we were captains. It was just too hard, so that was the unwritten rule – stay away from each other on the day of the game. That was always the best way to do it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so this weekend's Kings-Flames match-up, which is a big moment on the NHL's January calendar, is a smaller deal for Sutter, just because he's done this before. Multiple times. Over and over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Quite honestly, I'm used to this,” said Sutter, who also coached the Chicago Blackhawks and Sharks. “We've already been to Chicago and San Jose since I've been to L.A. Calgary's the only other place left [among his former teams].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm glad we get in the day before. I only wish we had a day in between the back-to-backs, but that's just the way it is. The schedule is still really tough.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some things, it seems, never change.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't a week after Barack Obama put the Keystone XL oil pipeline on ice for a couple of years that the project's Canadian proponent made a somewhat surprising announcement.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TransCanada offered to reroute the pipeline around the ecologically sensitive Sand Hills area of Nebraska that had become the epicentre of opposition to the proposal. TransCanada's new position left many perplexed; why hadn't the company made that offer from the beginning?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer is money. Changing the path would mean adding an extra 65 kilometres of pipe and tens of millions of dollars to the bottom line. TransCanada decided to go direct – and cheap – and, in the process, badly miscalculated the environmental conflict its proposed route would generate. And by gambling that it could overcome any protests, TransCanada may now have lost the opportunity altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I mention this as the National Energy Board hearings into Enbridge's Northern Gateway pipeline get under way near Kitimat, B.C. The project is Canada's own Keystone, and the hostility toward it is being framed in the same grandiose terms: the biggest environmental showdown Canada has witnessed in generations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the outset, concern has centred on Enbridge's plans to take the pipeline across northern B.C. to Kitimat, where gargantuan oil tankers would come to collect the Alberta crude and then take it out through the narrow Douglas Channel before hitting the open ocean and the far-off Asian markets for which the oil is primarily intended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This plan has conjured up images of an Exxon Valdez-scale disaster in one of B.C.'s most pristine areas. The channel adjoins the Great Bear Rainforest, a 64,000-square-kilometre stretch of wilderness considered one of the most ecologically sacred on Earth. This is why both aboriginals and environmentalists are preparing such a fierce fight to kill the project. Right now, the odds are in their favour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is why, in the end, a new Gateway route may have to be found. Some believe that it already exists and that Enbridge is bracing for this possibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many ways, building the pipeline so it finishes at Prince Rupert makes more sense, anyway. You already have a world-class port capable of handling large tankers. And once they're loaded, it's a shorter journey to Asia than it will be from Kitimat. And there aren't nearly the same environmental concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enbridge is obviously aware of this. But it rejected this scenario because the pipeline would have to traverse parts of the Skeena Valley, a particularly complex and technically challenging stretch of terrain. There's a high risk of avalanche throughout this area, and the spring runoffs can often be fierce, churning up river beds in dramatic fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This type of environment can be particularly troublesome for, say, a pipeline running underground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason we know this is because there's already a pipeline that runs through much of this same area. It's a natural gas line that was built in 1968 and is operated by <span class="companylink">Pacific Northern Gas</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greg Weeres, Pacific's vice-president of operations and engineering, confirmed that the Skeena Valley is taxing mountain topography. Over the years, the gas line has been affected by avalanches and land movement created by runoffs. Access is difficult; crews have to be flown in by helicopter to do repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, the line has been operating for more than 40 years. And it will likely be running for another 40 and beyond that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given a challenge, engineers can do almost anything. Advancements in theory and design have addressed many of the problems early pipeline builders in Canada encountered. There's no question we have the minds to construct an oil pipeline to Prince Rupert that would be safe, reliable and efficient.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would certainly be more costly for Enbridge. But when you're talking about a project worth tens of billions in revenue, it seems like a small price to pay. I wouldn't be surprised if this is ultimately where the company ends up. But like TransCanada, it probably will have to be forced into the move. And that comes with risks all of their own.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Salt reduction is off the table as a federal public-health campaign. The federal government hasn't said so publicly. In fact, it boasts of a goal to reduce salt consumption from the gluttonous 3,400 mg a day to a more moderate 2,300 mg a day by 2016. But it has no plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was only last New Year's Day – in 2011 – that Prime Minister Stephen Harper called this goal-setting one of his major accomplishments of the previous year. But the proof is in the salty pudding.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada has talked a good game on salt. Five years ago, the Conservative government established a working group of health experts, industry members and senior officials to develop a plan. That plan, three years in the making, centred around the drafting of voluntary targets for salt reduction in prepared foods such as waffles and cookies. Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq then disbanded the working group, and Health Canada floated a more timid idea – sales-weighted averages for salt-reduction (some products could be high in salt if others were low). Now, even that idea seems to have floated away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new answer appears to dispense with a serious strategy. “We believe that by working with industry and other organizations we can ultimately achieve better results that will provide low-sodium options for Canadians,” Ms. Aglukkaq's official spokesman, Steve Outhouse, said in an e-mail to The Globe. Nineteen health groups, including the Canadian Medical Association, have urged Ottawa to take the issue more seriously. Low-sodium options don't sound like a way to achieve a population-wide reduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reducing salt in prepared foods could save thousands of lives and billions of dollars. Most cardiovascular disease is preventable through reduced consumption of salt, the Public Health Agency of Canada says. Salt reduction is as important for the heart as reducing obesity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Britain has had success with a gradual and voluntary approach that enlists the food industry's co-operation – the public's palate accepted incremental reductions. Keeping an eye on a voluntary system need not be a “bureaucratic nightmare,” as Mr. Outhouse puts it. Canada has a voluntary system in place for trans fat reductions in prepared foods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Canadian government has allowed the industry's reluctance to rule. As long as Canadians continue to die because they consume too much salt, it is not too late for the government to show leadership.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• I'm friends with a woman through the local mommy circle. When I mentioned that we were about to embark on a home renovation, she suggested that her contractor husband could quote on the job. He seemed knowledgeable and fair, so we hired him without much due diligence. Everything started swimmingly; he showed up every day with a great crew and we even socialized en famille a few times. Then things fell apart. He began asking for payments early, which we naively gave him. Then, we started catching him making scary mistakes. Finally, after telling us that he'd lost money on the job, he basically stopped showing up. I still see his wife, and the way she talks about him and his work, I swear she has no idea. She's still reaching out to us socially, and I recently heard her recommending him to a mutual acquaintance. What do I do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, this type of thing happens all the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've been through a few contractors. One guy – ugh, finding out he wasn't a good “fit” was a slow, agonizing process. Took years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We liked him because he was cheap and would often find less expensive ways around problems. For example, our garage was so decrepit the roof was literally falling in. Other contractors would stand around, thumbs in tool belt, hem and haw, eyeball from all angles, and then, finally: “Yeah, you gotta tear the whole thing down, build a new one.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Me: “How much?” Them, with gunslinger squint: “Why don't we go inside?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tap tap on calculator, scritch scratch on paper: Twenty grand, minimum. Each thousand like a separate knife in my heart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This guy figured out a way to rebuild it from the inside. Three grand!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he was slo-o-o-o-o-w. Too chatty. An ex-hippie, what he really wanted to do was not sand drywall or drill screws but fill the air with “philosophical” palaver, and hammer home various points about our political system. The result: Jobs would take forever and cost us way more than originally projected. Not to mention the wear and tear on the household of having an extra dude in it pretty much perpetually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, we had to let him go. That was rough, and he probably still hates our guts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was another guy, recommended by my friend to build a bookshelf. Let's call my friend “Fred” and the guy he recommended “Bob.” Bob never showed up when he said he would, avoided phone calls, wanted money, etc. When very mildly called out by my wife Pam, in the manner of screw-ups throughout history, he chewed her out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I told my friend Fred about it, he revealed that Bob's last five clients were furious with him, and one was planning to sue! “So why'd you recommend him?” I asked. Fred admitted, with an embarrassed chuckle, that he was friends with Bob's wife and felt sorry for him, and her. Thanks a lot, Fred!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Happy ending: We've got a guy we love now. I don't even want to talk about him. Me to him is like Gollum to the ring. If anyone asks me about him, I get all secretive and shifty: “They want to hire away my precioussss.”)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any case, do as I say, not as I do, people: Do not hire contractors just because they (and you) are cheap; and do not rely on recommendations from friends or relatives or people in your mommy circle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Get every prospective contractor to provide you with references. And sit down and punch in the digits and check up on the mofo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, it's a pain. Yes, it takes time. Yes, it's a bore. But, as you found out the hard way, it could save you a world of grief and a pantload of cash in the long run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And pantloads of cash are what home renovation's all about, as anyone who's been through the process knows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One more rule of thumb: Unless it's someone you know and trust, don't cough up more than a third of what you owe – at most a half – until the job's done. Or you run the risk of your contractor just melting into the crowd before he's finished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As to your case, and whether you should mention the whole shabby situation to the wife, I would have to say: Hell yeah! It's business not personal, and she was the one who took it from the realm of the personal to the sphere of business by putting up her husband for the job.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We had a recession back in 2008-09, but you might not have known it by the way people kept spending and borrowing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the economy is growing modestly, and yet a recent national poll has suggested that 70 per cent of Canadians believe the country is in recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is progress. You're much more likely to have your financial priorities straight if you're worried right now about the future. Here are 10 money rules to prepare you for any tough times ahead:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 You have to save more because fat investment returns won't be there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock markets have certainly started the year nicely, and that sometimes indicates a good year ahead. Then again, the S&amp;P/TSX composite index started well last year but lost 11 per cent overall. As for interest rates, do you see any sign ahead that bonds and guaranteed investment certificates will suddenly start paying much more? Me neither.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2Quality dividend growth stocks rule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial writers like me have been pushing dividend stocks on you since forever. Want to know why? Because we believe that in an uncertain world, a company that can afford to pay cash to shareholders four times annually, and increase those payments from year to year, is the best deal going. Dividend stocks can fall in price, but the good ones keep paying cash all the while.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3Forget early retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You likely can't afford it, given our increasingly long lifespans and spotty commitment to saving. A recent <span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion Bank</span> poll showed the average age at which people hope to retire is 61. Talk about a rich fantasy life. Do these people also believe in the lost city of Atlantis and unicorns? Note: Some of the happiest seniors I come across are the ones who are still working to some extent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4Have a job-loss strategy in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An emergency fund with three months living expenses is great, but even a fund that can carry the mortgage for a few payments is better than nothing. Keep your money in a high-rate savings account. Oh, and a line of credit can be helpful to bridge you over a period of money troubles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5Housing wealth won't get you through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Counting on getting a big whack of money from the sale of your home to help pay for your retirement? Consider two things: There's more downside risk than upside potential for home prices in the near to medium term, and the price of buying a condo or bungalow is higher than you think.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6An economic slowdown, if we get one, will be worse than the last time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you didn't live in the auto-industry-dependent Ontario cities of Windsor and Oshawa, the last economic dip went by in a flash. Low interest rates helped us spend our way out of that setback, and low borrowing costs persist. But how much spending room is there without adding to our already huge debt loads?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">7Keep an eye on your company pension plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you have a defined benefit plan, where your employer commits to paying you a set amount per month based on your earnings, and years of service, keep a close watch on both the financial health of your plan and your company. Once you're in retirement, it's too late to supplement your pension benefits with your own savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8 Taking on student debt has to pay off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To begin with, youth unemployment rates are about double the national rate. Next, add generational competition between 20-somethings trying to break into the work force and 60-somethings who want to continue working instead of retiring. It doesn't make sense to rack up giant debts on courses that won't give you an edge in this competitive work world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9It's go-to time for financial planners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planners, people have never needed your help more. Rampant debt, low levels of retirement saving, guesswork investing – couldn't a comprehensive financial plan offer a big fix? Of course, you'll have to first sort out whether your business model is selling advice or selling investment products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10The financial industry is hungry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What do banks, fund companies and investment firms do when profits are harder to come by? They get clients to pay higher fees and borrowing costs. Be vigilant about these extra costs. Complain to your firm or bank and then see whether you can get out of paying them because you're a great catch as a customer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the contrary, if the Syrian government's security forces had restrained themselves from shooting at unarmed demonstrators, there would probably not have any violent opposition in the first place. The Baathist regime's whole response has shown its bad conscience; Mr. al-Assad and his followers appear to have been afraid that the demonstrations would keep getting larger.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The armed insurgents in Syria will have a hard time attaining outright military victory, but they have a good chance of carrying on a long-term war of attrition, in which the eventual advantage will not be in the regime's favour – its narrow support base in the Alawite minority is a fragile one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the conflict is taking on international dimensions, with Turkey giving haven to refugees, and at least tolerating the presence of some of the Syrian insurgents. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish Prime Minister, has made clear that civil war in neighbouring Syria is an unacceptable threat to Turkey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Qatar, with its highly idiosyncratic foreign policy (being an absolute monarchy that selectively promotes democracy abroad) has been one of the main forces behind the Arab League's willingness to take on an activist role in the internal affairs of a few of its members. But the reluctance of some Arab states to take up an unfamiliar task has resulted in a mission that is too small to observe effectively what is really going on in the streets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. al-Assad spoke to Barbara Walters of ABC News in December, he almost admitted he was fully in control of his own security forces. This week, he looked much more confident when he spoke for 100 minutes about Syria being the heart of the Arab world – as well as the victim of a conspiracy. That sense of assurance is a dangerous delusion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you see a familiar face – a sibling or a close friend – is there any uncertainty prior to that moment of recognition? What about an old schoolmate or someone you've only met once or twice before? Do you sometimes need a few seconds or more to figure out who the person is? Have you ever drawn a complete blank when looking at the face of someone you should otherwise know quite well?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most people can distinguish one face from another, but the results of a growing number of studies suggest that the ability to visually process and recognize faces is not universal and can vary tremendously from one person to the next. Some may rarely forget a face. But at the other end of the continuum are individuals who may be unable to identify any face, even if it's one of their kids, their spouse or their own reflection in a mirror. This face blindness is formally called prosopagnosia, a term that combines the Greek words for “face” and “lack of knowledge.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prosopagnosia has long been known to occur as a result of stroke or other brain damage. But scientists now recognize that it can occur even in the absence of any disease or injury. This congenital or developmental form of face blindness can run in families, and occurs with varying degrees of severity in an estimated 2 per cent of the population. Thus, in Canada alone there may be over 650,000 individuals who are seriously impaired in their ability to tell one face from another. And many more may find remembering faces a challenge, even if the problems they experience are not as severe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A large proportion of the human brain is devoted to processing visual information. Neuroimaging studies have revealed that specific regions within the occipital and temporal lobes are especially responsive to faces. Researchers have yet to fully explain how these areas contribute to face perception. Nevertheless, the occipital face area, near the lower back and side of the brain, appears to be critical for the initial analysis of a face and its specific features. A bit ahead of this is a region in the temporal lobe called the fusiform face area, which seems to be more heavily involved in processing the overall configuration of facial features – the nose in relation to the eyes and mouth – and otherwise representing the identity of a face as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent research suggests that this more holistic processing – seeing the forest instead of a bunch of trees, so to speak – is particularly important when considering individual differences in face-recognition abilities. A growing number of studies have revealed that face blindness is associated with a deficit in holistic processing. And superior face perception and recognition in a more general population has also been shown to be correlated with how strongly an individual displays holistic face processing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately there may be hope for those who struggle to figure out if they've met someone before. Researchers have used computerized training over the course of several days to enhance individuals' attention to the overall configuration of facial features. Results suggest that such training in individuals with congenital face blindness can subsequently improve face perception, and enhance the co-ordination of activity between the occipital and fusiform areas.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's one thing on which we can all agree. The Liberal Party of Canada is right when it says it needs “radical change.” Today's Liberals are essentially the party of Toronto's Annex class, and not much else. Unless they can resuscitate themselves, the Conservatives will run Canada until the seas run dry. (The NDP will never run Canada. Trust me on this.)</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sadly, radical change is not in sight – not this weekend, as the party's tattered remnants gather in Ottawa to map out their Road to Renewal – and not any time soon. No party that's ready to elect Sheila Copps as president is sincerely interested in renewal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there's the matter of what they stand for. “The Liberals have shown they're only capable of coming up with old ideas, tired ideas and bad ideas,” says a cynical friend, and on the evidence, he's right. As the Western world is buffeted by economic storms, rising inequality and unsustainable entitlements, the Liberals are preparing to debate such urgent matters as legalizing marijuana, bringing back the Wheat Board, expanding hate-propaganda laws to include gender hatred, and abolishing the monarchy (a task that's almost constitutionally impossible).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These ideas – so slight, so silly and so distracting – are a sign of intellectual exhaustion. Even Liberals know that, if they want to reconnect with the “soul” of Canada, as one party stalwart put it, they'll have to come up with something better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But maybe you can't blame them too much. The progressive left is floundering everywhere. Their best ideas are used up. The postwar institutions they worked so successfully to build are in big trouble. And they have no idea what to do about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Francis Fukuyama writes in a powerful new essay, The Future of History, “it has been several decades since anyone on the left has been able to articulate, first, a coherent analysis of what happens to the structure of advanced societies as they undergo economic change and, second, a realistic agenda that has any hope of protecting a middle-class society.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The liberal democracies are at the end of the welfare-state road, and all of them are looking for a map. Their aging demographics mean that entitlement spending is exploding just as economic growth has slowed dramatically. Raising taxes on the rich won't solve this problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, our barnacle-encrusted public institutions have shown they are too expensive, too unresponsive, too inflexible and too captive to their own interest groups to deliver services in effective and efficient ways. Both health care and public education are weighed down by excessive bureaucracy, lack of competition and rule-bound work practices that belong to the age of the medieval guilds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fixing the public sector will be among the top priorities of governments for the next generation. But as Mr. Fukuyama points out, the mainstream left remains obsessed with defending the status quo. “Thus, when existing social democratic parties come to power, they no longer aspire to be more than custodians of a welfare state that was created decades ago.” The Liberals also need to stop assuming that most Canadians trust and respect the wisdom of government as much as they do. Hint: They don't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble with the Liberals is, they know what they're against (anything attached to Stephen Harper) but have no idea what they're for. Although the age of ever-expanding entitlements is at an end, they can't help themselves from thinking up some more. The worst part is that, despite their accusations that Mr. Harper is a dangerous right-wing radical, on most substantive matters (such as fiscal policy, immigration policy and free trade), they basically agree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deeper question posed by Mr. Fukuyama is whether liberal democracy can survive the decline of the middle class. Hardly anyone predicted that technology and globalization would have such dramatically disparate effects – enriching some people, dislocating so many others. It's these factors, rather than Wall Street robber-bankers, that are driving the growth in inequality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How might society mitigate these flaws in capitalism in ways that are politically acceptable? Perhaps the Liberals could get around to thinking about this one of these days. I'd like them to prove my cynical friend wrong. I'd like the Tories not to be the only game in town.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other day I was standing outside, trying to warm up for a while after being in a heavily air-conditioned conference room for two hours. About 10 feet away, an ABC employee was making a call on his cellphone. “He wants a large black coffee with two shots of espresso,” he roared into the phone. “He wants it right now. You better get on it right now. And I said right now!” Then he hung up and glared at me because yes, I was staring at him.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TV racket is utterly ridiculous. Many of those who work in it are decent people and many are barking mad. Others are narcissistic nitwits. The right-now coffee was probably for some network exec or showrunner. The sort of person who believes that the intricacies of developing a copycat comedy are as important as the intricacies of creating peace in the Middle East. Pomposity is rampant. Arrogance is everywhere. On the critics' tour, you see it up close and see that the TV racket is as crazy as its impact is vast. Herewith, a list of 10 stoopid things about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. The lingo. Paul Lee, ABC's head honcho, talking about some show he likes, says, “It's sexy, it's sticky, it's more-ish, as the British say – you just want more of it.” So “more-ish” means you want more of it and “sticky” means you want it to stick around. Seriously, that is real TV exec lingo. An exact quote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. The look. It's cookie-cutter. A lot of TV actors look the same. They're short with big heads. Big heads work for the camera. Wednesday night after the ABC party I was outside gawking. The ABC stars were leaving, the CBS stars arriving. It looked like a giant family reunion in the lobby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. The thin thing. All the female actors from Desperate Housewives could sit together on the same bar stool. This is totally true. I measured. The bar stool, that is. And eyeballed the Wives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. The lies. “To be honest with you, it's hard to imagine the network without House,” Fox network boss Kevin Reilly said on Sunday. This is nonsense. The contracts of everybody on House are finishing this year. Of course Fox can imagine life without House. It is furiously developing a cheaper replacement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Darnell, president of Alternative Entertainment for Fox, also said of American Idol host Ryan Seacrest, “It's very hard to imagine the show without Ryan.” Right. Seacrest's contract, worth $15-million (U.S.) a year, is also finishing. In this economy, you give $15-mil to a guy who merely hosts a show for five months?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. The money. See Ryan Seacrest's salary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. Kevin O'Leary. He's on ABC's Shark Tank, its version of Dragons' Den, as well as CBC's Dragons' Den thing. He was at the ABC party on Tuesday night, I was told. Couldn't miss him, in an electric pink tie. I spent 40 minutes looking for the blustering guy, to thank him for providing me with such a wealth of material. Never found him. If TV didn't make stars of such people I wouldn't be wasting my time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">7. The American Dream thing. Apparently Fox's American Idol is “all about making the American Dream come true,” according to judge Randy Jackson. So the “American Dream” involves mocking weird-looking people who can't sing for weeks on TV before the competent karaoke singers arrive?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8. The fear of offending. The show GCB, based on the satirical novel called Good Christian Bitches, is described by ABC boss Lee as “actually very pro-religion,” and the show's executive producer insists that “the church is sacred” in the show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh come on. It's better to just admit that, yeah, some viewers might be offended. Because somebody always is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9. The phony wars between shows. American Idol's Jackson says NBC's The Voice features “second-chance people” and its use of rotating chairs on set is a “rip-off of Star Trek.” Street fight! Smackdown! Oh for heaven's sake, they're all just silly singing shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10. The lack of originality. A lot of TV comedy and drama is simply derived from other TV comedy and drama, not the real world. Steve Levitan, who runs Modern Family, said here, “I actually tell the writers not to watch TV so it doesn't kill story ideas.” Good move. A reason why his show is good.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INSIDE THE TV RACKET</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Truth</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ashley Judd has studied at Harvard and does most of her own stunts in the upcoming ABC action-drama Missing. She's proud of that. She also has to deliver this line in the first episode: “I'm not CIA! I'm a mother looking for her son.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hype</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ABC's Paul Lee says of political drama Scandal, by the creator of Grey's Anatomy, “Shonda Rhimes took an eight-episode arc and … built it into a fabulous piece of television.” Actually, eight minutes in, it looks phony and dated.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who would expect Stephen Harper's cry of injustice in the oil sands to be about the colour of foreign money?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harper made the complaint, then Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver followed in an open letter: Foreign money is interfering with Canadian decisions about the Northern Gateway Pipeline, which would transport Alberta oil to a B.C. port so it could be shipped overseas. It came after some foreigner-fearmongering from oil-sands advocacy group ethicaloil.org, which, working as Ottawa's cat's paw, asked Mr. Oliver to “ban foreigners” from public hearings on the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is economically dependent on trade, seeking to attract investors and aspiring to influence the world. The pipeline is partly financed by foreign investors to sell oil to Asia, and it's opposed (among others) by those who fear it will speed global warming. This is international business and geopolitics, and the front lines of global debate, the crossing of Canada and the world. Canada's whining about some foreign funding of activists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There really is, as Mr. Harper says, a big issue of national strategy around selling energy to Asia, rather than just the U.S., which requires pipelines to the West Coast. There really are environmental groups that oppose developing the oil sands at all. But to pretend what matters is preventing foreign money from influencing Canadian resource decisions is parochial and disingenuous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heaven forfend that foreign interests try to influence Canadian pipeline policy by funding organizations here. Like the Canadian Energy Pipelines Association. Three out of 10 of their member companies are subsidiaries of American ones : Spectra Energy, Kinder Morgan Canada, and <span class="companylink">Plains Midstream Canada</span>, controlled by Plains All American.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over four days in November, CEPA lobbyists met with 30 MPs (28 Tories including two ministers), six deputy ministers, and a dozen other senior officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Conoco Phillips</span>, developing an Alaskan gas pipeline that would cut through Canada, also lobbies. On other issues, like Chinese takeovers of Canadian oil firms, companies like <span class="companylink">China National Offshore Oil Corporation</span> get meetings, as they did in November, with senior Canadian officials and Mr. Oliver. Foreign governments care, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harper announced Wednesday that he'll make his second trip to China in February. His new priority, selling oil to Asia, will surely be a hot topic, as well as adding to $10-billion in Chinese oil investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't wrong for foreign oil companies to discuss projects with Canadian officials, or for foreign backers of Northern Gateway, like France's Total and China's Sinopec, to support it at hearings. Or for environmental groups to take American sums to oppose it. The panel's reviewing evidence, not taking a poll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Oliver's letter complained that environmentalists with foreign money will slow the review, and the process should be changed. For a government in power six years to say that on the eve of hearings they deem crucial is like admitting to sleeping on the job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They woke up after losing another pipeline battle last fall to environmentalists, when U.S. President Barack Obama delayed a decision on the Keystone XL pipeline to the Gulf Coast. They went looking for an opponent here, because it's better to be on offence. So Mr. Oliver caricatured the funders as “billionaire socialists from the United States” – who would sympathize with those?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a nervy response that looks like browbeating a panel, shutting down critics, and whiny, selective xenophobia. This is a serious issue, and Ottawa's busy cutting targets out of cardboard.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TORONTO -- jblair@globeandmail.com</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DeMar DeRozan became the face of the Toronto Raptors the second Chris Bosh left town and he was not very good during this stretch of three games in as many nights.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet for all the talk about how Raptors head coach Dwane Casey will find out some things about his new team in this compressed NBA season, there is a wisdom in not viewing the past five games as a referendum on DeRozan. Because when it comes to offence, the NBA has shown a distinctly and predictably ugly face. Not yet 1998-99 ugly – when the NBA came out of a lockout with a jerry-rigged season that turned into the lowest-scoring season since the shot clock was introduced in 1954 – but ugly nonetheless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You'd expect teams to improve offensively as the season goes on. Still, going into Wednesday's slate of games, including the Raptors' 98-91 loss to the Sacramento Kings, a total of 15 teams were averaging more than 15 turnovers a game, compared to four at the end of last season. Fourteen teams shot .460 or better from the field last season; this season, seven teams had done so. In the 2010-11 season, 11 teams averaged more than 100 points a game. Through Tuesday, just five teams were averaging 100 points. Using offensive efficiency – number of points per 100 possessions – as a measure, half the league (15 teams) was under 100 points going into Wednesday. Three teams finished the season under 100 in 2010-11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Offensive efficiency is down,” Casey said. “You watch some teams and you can see they're making the same mistakes we make. It's ugly – and we're ugly, offensively, in spurts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But I'd rather get bad shots than turnovers, because at least you can get back into your defence.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Casey's comments were made before the game. Then, one night after losing 93-78 to the previously winless Washington Wizards, in which the Raptors had a season-high 23 turnovers, they had 18 more on Wednesday in finishing their only back-to-back-to-back run of games with a 1-2 record. The Raptors have 73 turnovers in four games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DeRozan was once again something of a passenger – 13 points in 29 minutes 5 seconds, giving him 44 points in five games since hitting a season-high 25 points in a 92-77 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Jan. 4. Thank goodness his replacement at two-guard off the bench, Leandro Barbosa, was 11-for-18 with 24 points. Linas Kleiza made his first appearance since in 11 months after undergoing microfracture surgery on Feb. 1 to repair both a torn meniscus and chondral defect in his right knee, and had 10 points and three rebounds. Yet while celebrating the return of Kleiza, the Raptors were forced to play down the stretch without Andrea Bargnani, who strained his left calf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a game against the Indiana Pacers on Friday followed by a three-game trip to Chicago, Atlanta and Boston in a five-day span, the ugliness could get uglier for DeRozan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If he was not working on his shot every day, I'd be concerned,” Casey said. “He's still 21. There's still a lot of growth. I had Rashard Lewis in Seattle and it was the same type of thing: three of four games he couldn't hit the broad side of a barn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My thing is, if you miss a shot get your butt back defensively and don't make the same mistake on the defensive end,” Casey said. “Don't just wait for your next shot to come around.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a flash of what DeRozan needs to do down the stretch when he drove the lane and spun a lay-up in to make it 80-75. Go to the hoop. Play with abandon. This is a season to get knee-deep in the muck and mire, because there's plenty of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JEFF BLAIR'S MORNING SHOT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agent Scott Boras may not be the master of the universe after all. Ryan Madson settled for a one-year, $8.5-million contract with the Cincinnati Reds on Wednesday after Boras mishandled a four-year, $44-million offer from the Philadelphia Phillies in November and Francisco Rodriguez, who in midseason fired Paul Kinzer as his agent in favour of Boras, accepted salary arbitration to set up for the Milwaukee Brewers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This from a guy who had a $17.5-million vesting option as the New York Mets' closer before Boras waived the clause for $500,000, freeing up his client for middle-reliever purgatory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And five weeks away from pitchers and catchers reporting, Prince Fielder still doesn't have a team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could all be posturing, of course, but the Washington Nationals told MLB.com that there was a “90-per-cent chance” that they wouldn't sign Fielder, and they've been considered the front-runners for weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boras has even sent out signals about accepting a shorter-termed contract with a higher annual average value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Baseball people who suggested the absence of market drivers such as the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox created a new free-agent dynamic were right: Fielder will have waited longer to sign than just about any other big-name free agent of recent vintage, surpassing Vladimir Guerrero's wait for a seven-year deal from the Baltimore Orioles (Jan. 11, 2004) – and taking aim at Carlos Delgado's signing date of Jan. 26, 2005, when he inked a four-year, $52-million deal with the then-Florida Marlins.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I first went to Haiti, before the earthquake, I was surprised by the faint whiff of optimism in the air. Despite the billion-dollar hurricane damage in 2008, there was a sense that maybe the poorest country in our half of the world might be getting itself on track. There was a long way to go, but maybe something good could happen here.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then came the earthquake – more than 200,000 people killed in 45 seconds. Port-au-Prince was shaken to its foundations as every other building was damaged or destroyed. Friends, neighbours, colleagues – killed in an instant. The Ministry of Education – destroyed. The national nursing school – destroyed. The Supreme Court building – destroyed. Block after city block reduced to rubble. In less than a minute, Haiti lost the equivalent of a year's GDP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the two years since the quake, a million people have left their temporary shelters. But that means 500,000 people are still living in tents. They don't have the money to build a new place and they can't afford rent, so they stay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the streets still appear chaotic, half the rubble has been removed. The Haitian relief effort is clearing up the mess at the same pace the rubble of the World Trade Center was cleared away. There's just a lot more of it in Haiti.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The schools that were open before the quake are functioning again. It's not enough that only 50 per cent of Haiti's children go to school, but it's significant progress compared with the shattered education system two years ago. Haitian President Michel Martelly and Unicef are working on a five-year plan to make primary education free and accessible to all children – a revolution this country needs. Two taxes are being considered to make this sustainable, one on incoming long-distance calls and another on remittances from abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2010, child protection services have been strengthened. For the first time in Haiti, there are standards of care for children, and half of the country's orphanages are registered. Haiti also signed the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption in 2011, making orderly and secure international adoptions possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the alleys and byways of Port-au-Prince, social services are being driven by countless community groups. Schools, clinics, sports clubs and daycare centres knit together the fabric of community as the city begins to heal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With more than half of the country under 24 years old, young people must take the lead. Gilet Maxcène is one of them. He lives in one of the tent cities, but almost four years ago, he and his friends started an after-school group for youngsters “because this is our way to help build our country.” Around the country, local groups provide programs for 120,000 children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's still too much rubble in the streets, too many people without permanent shelter and too many people without jobs. But when we compare Haiti today with two years ago, victories are easily found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent business forum announced $8-billion in private investment pledges, and government ministries are starting to function again after 18 months of paralysis. International donors have released almost half of the money they had pledged to reconstruction, and there's hope this will pick up now there's a government in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After two years of hard work, the country is getting back to where it was before the earthquake – it isn't good enough yet, but maybe, just maybe, reconstruction efforts are finally getting on track and the pre-quake whiff of optimism can blossom into real hope for Haiti's future.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicotine patches don't apparently work for their intended purpose, which is to help smokers butt out. But they may give a memory boost to people suffering from early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Those are the conclusions of two separate studies that explored different aspects of nicotine replacement therapy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one study, Harvard and University of Massachusetts researchers recruited 787 adults who had recently quit smoking. At the outset, the participants were asked what, if any, aids they had used to help them kick the habit, including nicotine replacement therapy (such as patches, gum and inhalers), got advice from a doctor, or joined a smoking-cessation program. The researchers then followed the subjects over a period of five years to see who resumed smoking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings, published in the journal Tobacco Control, revealed that one-third of those who quit eventually succumbed to their old vice. What's more, there was no significant difference in the relapse rate among people who used nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) and those who didn't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This study shows that NRT is no more effective in helping people stop smoking cigarettes in the long-term than trying to quit on one's own,” said the lead author, Hillel Alpert, a research scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He noted that nicotine is indeed a key addictive ingredient in cigarettes. But, unfortunately, the urge to keep smoking comes from more than just a nicotine craving. A lot of psycho-social factors must be overcome to beat the habit once and for all, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the second study, the nicotine patch produced far better results – although the researchers used the product in a rather unorthodox way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trial involved 74 people who had mild cognitive impairment, which is the stage between normal aging and dementia when people have mild memory or thinking problems but no significant disability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers, led by Paul Newhouse of Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, treated half the subjects with nicotine patches, while the other half was given placebos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After six months of treatment, the nicotine group regained 46 per cent of normal performance for their age on long-term memory tests, while the placebo group actually got worse by 26 per cent, according to the results published in the journal Neurology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Newhouse said previous studies have suggested nicotine stimulates brain receptors, which play a role in memory and thinking: “So what we are trying to do is help that system work a little more effectively by providing [extra] stimulus with this drug.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he acknowledged, “we do not know whether benefits persist over long periods of time and provide meaningful improvement.” But he hopes additional research will show that “this could be one part of a comprehensive treatment approach” for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although nicotine patches may have a new future as a memory aid, Dr. Newhouse isn't surprised they don't seem to help current smokers. In recent decades, he noted, smoking rates have plummeted. “People who could easily stop smoking have already done so. And what you have left is the most treatment-resistant group.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why some like a lot of booze</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new study has provided fresh insights into why some people drink to excess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using high-tech scanning equipment, researchers demonstrated that alcohol causes the brain to release opiate-like molecules called endorphins. The endorphins, in turn, bind to brain receptors which produce feelings of pleasure and reward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a series of experiments, the researchers compared the release of these molecules in 13 heavy drinkers and 12 “control” subjects. The findings, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, revealed that a drink produced a greater release of endorphins among the heavy drinkers. That suggests they likely get more pleasure out of each drink, which may contribute to their excessive drinking, said lead author Jennifer Mitchell of the Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research Center at the University of California, San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Mitchell and her colleagues are trying to develop new ways to prevent alcohol dependency. She noted that an existing anti-drinking medication, called naltrexone, locks up the opioid receptors so alcohol can't produce a pleasurable effect. But the drug blocks too many receptors and that makes a lot of patients feel miserable so they won't take it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Mitchell hopes that this study, and additional research, will lead to a new drug that can bind to specific brain receptors without producing unwanted side effects. “I think alcohol abuse is a treatable problem and we are inching ever closer to a much more amenable solution.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The safest surgeons</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Call it the Goldilocks Effect in the operating room. Not too young and not too old, surgeons who are between the ages of 35 and 50 provide the safest care, suggests a new study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers at the University of Lyon, in France, examined the relationship between the work experience of surgeons and the chances that patients would suffer from postoperative complications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, they looked at 3,574 thyroidectomies (the removal of the thyroid gland) preformed by 28 surgeons at five French hospitals over the course of a year. Patient records were checked for evidence of permanent hoarseness and damage to surrounding tissues – problems that can result from poor surgical techniques.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings showed that surgeons who had been practising for five to 20 years (which put them in the age range of 35 to 50) had better patient outcomes than their younger or older peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study, published online by the British Medical Journal, indicates that young surgeons improve with more experience. But it raises a troubling question about how to keep older surgeons performing at top capacity. Continuous monitoring and targeted retraining may be necessary to maintain patient safety, the researchers suggest.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outgoing president, Liberal Party of Canada</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This weekend, Liberals face some big choices about their party's future. The debate over primaries is really just a sideshow.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What are the key questions? Will the Liberal Party remain a tightly controlled club or transform itself into a modern, mass political movement? Are Liberals ready to convert top-down control of party processes into bottom-up empowerment of their supporters? Will they vote for an open party, accessible to all Canadians? Or a closed party, where membership has its privileges and insiders call the plays?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberal Party sees itself as the party of progress and reform, the voice of the people. Too long preoccupied with internal battles and games, it's now estranged from its base. Voters have grown weary and disconnected, while insider elites, obsessively hoping for a saviour, have watched their vote fall for more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than ever, Liberals need to revisit the darkest moments of their history, when creativity and courage were all they had.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians have sent Liberals to the political woodshed on three occasions – 1930, 1958 and 1984. Each time, the party was seen as arrogant, out of touch and out of date. Liberals bounced back by reaching out to new people with new ideas, and modernizing their organization. Renewed, the party earned its way back to governing – for 22 consecutive years the first time, 21 almost continuous years the second time, and 13 years in a row the last time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In each generation, the party's modernization proposals were thought by some to be radical and fraught with risk. But reformers carried the day each time because they were inspired by the vision of a more open, democratic, transparent, accountable party and because Liberals had the courage to embrace change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This weekend, Liberals consider a series of bold proposals to bring their party into the 21st century and vault it past opponents – including a much-mooted primary-style leader selection process. But primaries make no sense unless three other “radical” proposals are adopted first:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. A national riding-based fundraising appeal for a major investment in a National Call Centre to optimize the party's technology backbone in support of the party's outreach, organization and fundraising activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. A national person-to-person organizational drive to register “supporters” so Liberals can overcome their “data” deficiency, rebuild the party's relationships with the millions of Canadians who want to vote Liberal, and create a robust database of supporters from which to quickly expand membership, worker and donor lists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Widening participation in selecting the next permanent leader and the next generation of Liberal candidates beyond the paid membership to all registered party “supporters.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These proposals, if adopted, would revolutionize democratic engagement in Canada, changing the very nature of political power and how it's exercised. But will Liberals have the courage to lead? Will they vote to open up their party, by committing to building a data-driven political communications technology platform and by offering ordinary Canadians a say in choosing the faces and voices of the next Liberal generation?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Primaries could easily become just another gimmick. But if Liberals have courage to do first things first and do them well, Canadian-style leadership primaries will matter, the party will rise again and Canadian politics will be transformed for the better.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the depths of his pipeline-free riding in the heart of Toronto, National Resources Minister Joe Oliver has lashed out at “environmental and other radical groups” for “[threatening] to hijack our regulatory system to achieve their radical ideological agenda.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gosh, I haven't heard environmental activists smeared like that since Glen Clark labelled Greenpeace campaigners against old-growth logging “enemies of British Columbia.” Guess who won that round?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, the activists' great sin is to oppose the proposed Gateway pipeline from Alberta's oil sands – across B.C. and the territory of scores of native groups battling the project – to Kitimat, where tankers the size of 3.5 football fields will load up with crude and head for Asia through the province's narrow, pristine, coastal waterways. Who could be opposed to that but radicals? Never mind that B.C. will bear most of the ecological risk, without much permanent economic benefit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Oliver's diatribe also included outrage that funds from non-Canadians are being used in the fight against a project fuelled by the interests of foreign-based oil companies, including authoritarian China's huge, state-owned energy company, Sinopec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ethical oil, indeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And who's behind this ideologically driven, outside cash, Mr. Oliver was asked. “Billionaire socialists from the United States – people like George Soros,” he replied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sounds like someone itching to get into those wacky Republican debates and show up Mitt Romney for the socialist he really is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No, they're not booing. Nor are they celebrating “great save, Luongo!” with “Looooo …” It's China, and it's “Huuuu … ” You know, as in Hu's the president of China. That's right. Still, the Prime Minister's pending February visit seems an odd time to make Valentine's Day koochie koo in the People's Republic of China with the country's drab successor to Mao Zedong's legacy, Hu Jintao.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mirthless Mr. Hu is to be replaced later this year by China's next dear leader, Xi Jinping, cleverly headlined by The Economist as “Xi who must be obeyed.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, sadly, this means Mr. Harper's clear desire to talk tough on human rights, strongly support the Nobel Prize awarded to jailed Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo and forcefully defend the right of Tibetans to worship as they wish will be wasted on someone with not many more months in the top job. Might as well say nothing at all. Oh, well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The geezer on the $10 bill celebrated his 197th birthday this week by undoubtedly rolling over in his grave that a certain Muskoka cabinet minister from his governing Conservative Party apologized for telling a teen on twitter that he was a “jack ass.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sir John Eh Macdonald was made of sterner stuff. Once, having overly partaken of the grape, he threw up during a public election debate. Apologize? Pshaw. The great man merely wiped himself off and told the cringing crowd that he always feels sick when he hears his opponent speak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor should we forget his singular definition of political optimism: “When fortune empties her chamber pot on your head, smile, and say, ‘We are going to have a summer shower.'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those fine sentiments were still in play 125 years later for a fella named David Emerson, whose run for the Liberals in 2006 received an electoral urn of urine from the voters of Vancouver-Kingsway. Cue the summer shower. Two weeks later, Mr. Emerson was in Stephen Harper's cabinet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a pity so little is taught about Canada's first prime minister in the schools these days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the hanging of Louis Riel is hard to forgive, without Sir John Eh's vision and drive to forge the Dominion of Canada, we might well be participants in the risible political circus south of us, choosing a presidential candidate from among a plastic man named Mitt, an adulterer named Newt, and a bunch of guys from the phonebook. For that alone, thank you, Sir John.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I find it hard to believe I'm writing this, so full of life was he. But rest in peace, sweet, wonderful Allan Dowd, the long-time, Vancouver-based correspondent for Reuters who passed away this week after a short, tough battle with lymphoma. There was no better colleague on the beat, imbued, as he was, with whimsy, perception, grace and an enviable ability to ask tough, pertinent questions with a smile. No matter how mundane the event, it was always more pleasurable to cover when Allan was there. No airs, no territorial turf, no cynicism, yet ever ready with a quip or sly aside. Fun to work with, fun to share a beer with afterwards. Now, at 52, his voice and pen are stilled, and we are all the poorer for it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if Afghanistan is to become a country that can stop relying on outsiders for help, these killings need to end. If and when peace talks begin, Canada must push this issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian International Development Agency allocated $206-million from 2003 to 2011 to set up a functioning government. Some of the money paid the salaries of civil servants and teachers – who are among those being assassinated.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both projects are bound for the port of Kitimat – the Gateway to be loaded with crude oil from Alberta; the Pacific Trails carrying natural gas from northeast B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Gateway proposal has generated an incendiary debate, with concerns about potential oil spill disasters – whether from leaky pipes or from the coastal tanker traffic – running smack up against a nationalist fervor to free Canada's resource industries from unfavourable dependence on the U.S. market. Pacific Trails, by comparison, has sailed through the approval process. Opposition New Democrats support the project. It has broad first nations buy-in, and the Clark government sees it as the key to developing a liquefied natural gas industry. It is a fossil fuel business that, relative to the oil sands, comes with a green seal of approval. But both developments bring environmental impacts to Kitimat's doorstep, and the province has little idea what the cumulative result of all this industry packed into the community will be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are 13 regions in B.C. with an air quality management plan, but none for Kitimat which, despite the massive aluminum smelter perched on a hill to the west of town, is regarded by the province as having excellent air quality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between the Premier's ambitions and those of the Prime Minister, that could change. The pipelines are meant to end at Kitimat's port. The oil would be pumped into supertankers. Natural gas will be processed into LNG before moving on to the busy tanker port for transport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. Environment Minister Terry Lake is expecting to have on his desk this spring a technical review of the Gateway project. It's not meant for public consumption, but it will guide his government in forming an opinion on the oil pipeline that would cross the province, and the oil tankers that would traverse the treacherous B.C. coastline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with that information, the B.C. government probably won't come out clearly for or against the Gateway proposal. To say “no” would infuriate the conservative wing of the B.C. Liberal Party, which is being assiduously courted by the new B.C. Conservative Party. A “yes” would drive the influential green vote into the arms of the opposition New Democrats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It may sound like waffling,” Mr. Lake said in an interview. “But we want to listen to all of that information so that we understand all the possible ramifications and then decide how we react.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. has forfeited its opportunity to say no to Gateway formally, having signed a pact years ago giving the federal government control over projects that cross provincial borders. So the only aspect of development it can control is the LNG side. And there is growing uncertainty about what that will look like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province is expected to unwrap its natural gas strategy later this month. The Premier wants the jobs associated with an LNG industry, but there are complicating factors. Creating LNG is an energy-intensive process, and <span class="companylink">BC Hydro</span> doesn't have enough clean, green hydroelectricity for the three facilities Ms. Clark wants to see there. That means some will likely be burning natural gas to provide their own energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it turns out all this industrial development can't safely be sustained by Kitimat's air shed, will the province have to scale back its own objectives? Mr. Lake said there is no point studying the issue now, since the Gateway hasn't been approved yet and the extent of the LNG industry is still uncertain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We can say ‘these are the things we would like to see happen,' but we can't know for sure all of those things will happen, or can be done in a way that makes sense from an environmental point of view,” Mr. Lake said. “We're not saying these will happen come hell or high water.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AIR QUALITY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The B.C. government has not studied what will happen to the air if Kitimat becomes the epicentre of a new liquefied natural gas industry plus the marine terminal for the Gateway oil pipeline. But Enbridge, the pipeline proponent, has done some modelling. The Kitimat Terminal “has the potential to measurably affect air quality … during the construction and operations phases,” states a study filed by Enbridge as part of its massive application to the National Energy Board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each year, approximately 220 tankers are expected to call at the marine terminal. Three tugs would assist each tanker in the three-hour process of berthing. After that, each tanker would be on standby for approximately 16 hours, all the while running steam and auxiliary boilers to keep the bunker oil hot and pumps running. Add just one LNG plant and, at maximum levels, the result would exceed air-quality objectives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karen Campbell, a lawyer at Ecojustice, said the report underscores the need for the province to look at air quality before signing off on any more industrial development in Kitimat. “At some point in time you are going to have some serious issues with the air quality in that air shed,” Ms. Campbell said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are in the lead-up to an election in the United States, but you wouldn't know it from reading USA Today or The New York Times. The country's media is obsessed instead with a left-handed devout Christian – the ambiguously soft-spoken, elusive-running, aw-shucks dramatis personae named Tim Tebow, quarterback of the Denver Broncos.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How deep is America's psychosis? On Thursday, ESPN's SportsCenter devoted an entire hour to the former Heisman Trophy winner in advance of Saturday's AFC semi-final against the New England Patriots. He set a Twitter.com record last Sunday, as the subject of 9,429 tweets per second after beating the Pittsburgh Steelers in overtime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The image of his patented prayer stance after wins has been sent around the globe. Saturday Night Live did a skit in which Jesus visits Tebow to ask him to play better in the first half of games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American media has always fixated on star athletes. What sets Tebow apart is how many reporters and columnists seem to devoutly wish his complete failure as an NFL quarterback. It might be said that, never on the field of gridiron conflict, have so many wished so ill on so few.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a while, it seemed the media was going to be proven correct. After his improbable six-game winning streak, the Broncos were obliterated by New England, the Buffalo Bills and Kansas City Chiefs. Tebow looked mortal. MSM smiled the inner smile of contentment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It remained only for the mighty Steelers to cremate Tebow in the first round of the playoffs and spread his ashes around the ESPN parking lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except, it was Tebow who did the incinerating, burning the Steelers with 10 (count 'em) precision completions, culminating in an 80-yard overtime toss. Suddenly, the sluice gates reopened, and Tebowmania was unleashed once more upon America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why does the media resent Tebow so, even as he trends big time on Twitter?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly, the Jesus-is-my-Lord-and-saviour talk wears thin with the secular sorts in the fourth estate. Draft experts are heavily invested in the NFL stereotypes of the ideal athlete, and Tebow flies in the face of their perceived wisdom. ESPN's total absorption of the story has grated on competitors and social media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result? Tebow might be the first athlete to be massively underrated and overrated at the same time. A media miracle.</p>

If foreign gays and lesbians who received marriage licences in this country could not be married back home, they are not legally married, the Justice Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is an untenable, mechanistic argument – that the “law of domicile,” in effect, defeats the Canadian Constitution. Impossible. And unjust. And it is good to hear Justice Minister Rob Nicholson promise to fix this injustice.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The case involves a woman from Florida and one from the United Kingdom. They could not be married in either jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario granted them a marriage licence in 2005. Yet Canada said in a Toronto court that they can't divorce, because no marriage exists between them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thousands of years of laws and traditions did not stop this country's courts, and ultimately its federal Parliament, from legalizing gay marriage. What is the “law of domicile” (the legal capacity to marry in the place where one lives) next to the mighty and seemingly timeless law of man and woman in matrimony? Yet that law – of marriage reserved for man and woman – fell in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The higher law, of equality and human dignity, as protected by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, has changed the basic rules of marriage in Canada. Marriage presupposes a right to divorce, so couples may move on with their lives. And there are sound policy reasons for extending those rights to those from foreign jurisdictions who got married in Canada – to protect the interests of any children involved, for instance. It would also be the just thing to do to continue allowing gay marriage of foreign visitors, and to facilitate divorce, where necessary, by waiving one-year residency requirements in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Justice Department has an obligation to fix the anomalous situation facing many of the 5,000 gay couples who came to Canada to marry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is more than an anomaly – it's a humiliation, for the couples and the jurisdictions, such as Ontario, that welcomed them here, accepted their tourist dollars and gave them the marriage licences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This country legalized gay marriage to end exclusion – without ifs, ands or anomalies. Within Canadian borders, all rules on marriage and divorce should start from the premise of inclusion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On that January day when Anaheim Ducks general manager Bob Murray said that everybody on his team except Teemu Selanne and Saku Koivu were available for trade if things didn't improve, Ryan Getzlaf was immediately trending on Twitter in Canada.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It happened instantly. One minute the not-so-veiled warning escaped from Murray's mouth; in the next, Getzlaf had been traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs – in cyberspace, if not in the real NHL world, where deals are occasionally harder to manufacture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sadly, it has become clear – to Getzlaf, to Leaf Nation and more importantly to general managers around the league – that Murray's threat was mostly just that, designed to get everybody's attention, but not a serious attempt to move a 6-foot-4 centre who at 26, is just approaching his prime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I know how this business goes, and the pressure Bob's under, and I wasn't doing him any favours,” Getzlaf said in a moment of sober self-analysis Thursday. “That's the way things go. He's showed a lot of faith in me in years past and I'll continue to show that faith back to him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don't want to go anywhere,” continued Getzlaf, with emphasis. “Anaheim, the city itself, has been unbelievable for me. My wife is from there. It's definitely where we've laid our roots and plan to stay as long as we can.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anaheim was carrying a three-game win streak into Thursday night's date with the Calgary Flames, and even though its playoff hopes remain bleak, it looks as though the message was received. The Big 3 – consisting of Getzlaf, reigning NHL MVP Corey Perry and shifty winger Bobby Ryan – were finally starting to find the offensive range after a glacially slow offensive start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getzlaf has spoken to Murray about his intentions and says he doesn't need to. He “didn't take it personally.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getzlaf interpreted Murray's message as “more of a kick in the ass than anything; that I needed to get going – and I knew it as much as anybody.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It wasn't that I wanted to play that way. It was a frustrating time we were going through. I planned on working hard and getting back to where I needed to be and I think I'm there. Hopefully, we'll continue this into the second half and not have to worry about those rumours again.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getzlaf was 14th in league scoring last season, with 76 points in only 67 games after he missed a month with multiple facial fractures. On a points-per-game basis, that put him in the top five alongside Perry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year? He has just 27 points in 41 games, which prorated over a full season, would be his lowest total since his rookie year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an offensively challenged league, Getzlaf is one of a handful of NHL players who averaged more than a point a game in each of the past four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Ducks head coach Bruce Boudreau says he didn't see Getzlaf's line much live and in person, in his Washington Capitals days, but thought they were “as good as any line we've faced in the league – big and strong and powerful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When you can get a big, strong, powerful centre man, that's a want on a wish-list for every team.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getzlaf, according to Boudreau, hasn't scored at the rate he would like to, but noted: “For the most part, everybody has statistically some year they wish they could do over again – and he's still got half a year left. It wouldn't surprise me if, all of a sudden, he turned it on and got 50 to 60 points in the last half of the year and then everybody would say, it's a good year.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ducks have made the playoffs in five of the past six years and won the Stanley Cup in 2007, just as Getzlaf was emerging as an above-average NHL player.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, they will need an exceptional second-half push to make up the 17-point disadvantage on eighth place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the sense Thursday was that they would get a chance to do it together, rather than see the team dismantled because of a poor first half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what Getzlaf, as the captain, wants to see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a frustrating thing because we have the tools, we just couldn't put it all together,” Getzlaf said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A couple of our guys were struggling, myself included, and we can't have that to win in this league.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout the long salad days of the Liberal Party of Canada, it stood for many important things. It still stands for these things, but they're either less important now or have been adopted by other parties, leaving the Liberals as only one voice among many.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the time of Clifford Sifton in Wilfrid Laurier's government, Liberals were the immigrants' party. They backed a more open immigration policy than the Conservatives, who tended to be the party of white Protestants with a few Irish Catholics. Now there's an all-party consensus on immigration, and the Conservatives, having starting driving up immigration levels under Brian Mulroney, fight for immigrant votes even more forcefully than Liberals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liberals were the bridging party between Quebec and the rest of Canada, and between francophones and anglophones. Quebec has now faded from the consciousness of other Canadians, and vice versa. The relationship is so distant as to have become more mutually tolerable, so there's neither a crisis nor much interest in bridges, which means not much interest in a party that usually stood for a strong central government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals were the classic middle-class party, although they had plenty of wealthy supporters and used to win more trade union votes than the NDP. The middle class, however, has been under tremendous financial squeeze. Its numbers are shrinking as income inequalities widen. The pressures on middle-class families make them want to keep more of what they earn, precisely the pitch Conservatives have successfully made to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liberals were always the party of Canadian nationalism, but Conservatives are busy creating their own identification with historic, national symbols: the military, the monarchy, old wars and former Conservative prime ministers. And Canadian nationalism, which seemed to need nurturing for so long, has become ubiquitous, boisterous and self-confident, the property of no party any more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All these, and other, trends have been eating at the Liberal Party for a long time. Think of the chunks that have fallen away from the once-formidable Liberal coalition: francophones outside Quebec, many multicultural Canadians, blue-collar workers in the industrial cities of Ontario, federalist francophones in Quebec, Jews, Atlantic Canadians in cities such as St. John's, Halifax, Moncton and Saint John, the “business” Liberals from Toronto. It was an impressive coalition, malleable when necessary, mobilized around the broad ideas for which Liberals stood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's early days since the shellacking of the last election for the remains of the party to gather in convention, as will happen this weekend in Ottawa. Everything remains temporary about the Liberals: its “interim” leader, Bob Rae; its sense of policy direction; its building up (if possible) of a better fundraising machine; its national executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's easy to be critical of this state of suspended uncertainty, but what else would one reasonably expect from a party trying to pick itself up from the mat? The country is four years from an election, and all speculation about the political future is futile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A pessimist would say that the country has passed the Liberals by; that the West is ascendant and the Liberals have not spoken to that region for several generations; that Quebec no longer cares; that the lower middle class is largely lost; that the Liberals have become, as the British Liberals once were, a collection of intellectuals and individualists who get elected here and there and raise intriguing ideas but have neither the cohesion nor rootedness in any one place to contend for power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And all this might be true, save for the possibilities of hope to which Liberals might cling – that the NDP leadership candidates are deeply traditionalist in their thinking, with none offering a broadening of the party's appeal; that the Harper government, despite its huge advantages, can't break above 40 per cent in the polls and seems determined to govern in the most polarizing ways possible; that Canada remains a fundamentally pragmatic, non-ideological kind of political entity; that the Liberals have served up two less-than-inspiring leaders in succession and can't do worse the next time; and that, at the next election, the Conservatives will have been in office for roughly 10 years, when the democratic instincts for change can imperil any party's grip on power.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some days, honestly, I feel like a feminist version of Rip Van Winkle (Wrinkle?) or maybe it's Ripley's Believe It Or Not, waking up in a world that would have once been unthinkable after so many battles fought and won for contraception on demand, reproductive freedom, women's equality and gay rights.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here we are in 2012, and it's been a big week for “family values,” a politically loaded phrase that brings to mind the now legendary Newt Gingrich kiss-off – “pious baloney” – that he used in another context.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have inveighed against this loathsome phrase since the late 1980s, even though, in the eyes of those who promulgate it, I might look like a member in good standing within that particular gated ideological community – a straight woman, happily married to the same man for 28 years, with two grown children. Of course, when I open my mouth and support reproductive freedom, gay rights and same-sex marriage, all bets are off, no matter what pretty family picture we make.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Republican presidential contenders have been breathing new life into the family-values franchise. After yet another defeat, former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum intoned on CNN, “We need someone to stand up and fight for the family” – by which he arrogantly means the “sanctity” of a strictly defined nuclear family: one man, one woman, and many offspring, hopefully none of them gay. Mr. Santorum has likened homosexuality to bestiality, and thinks even the African proverb, “It takes a village to raise a child” is morally seditious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pope Benedict XVI has been busy too, warning that “liberal family values” are threatening the future of humanity, which news reports suggested was a “veiled reference to homosexual marriage and adoptions by gay couples.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Pope, presiding over a church that undermined the family worldwide by covering up the sexual abuse of young children by its priests, spawning cycles of suicide, abuse and post-traumatic stress, has even less moral authority on the subject of family values than that member of his flock, Rick Santorum, who at least appears to walk his virulent talk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And let's not feel morally superior here in Canada. We legalized same-sex marriage way back in 2004, and regularly elect “out” officials who don't conform to a rigid definition of family values. But as the headlines this week suggest, our federal government may be moving to nullify the same-sex marriages of people who came to Canada to marry, from jurisdictions where such marriages are illegal. If the Justice Department's legal opinion is upheld, it could throw thousands of lives into chaos. (God, I hope they don't go on a rampage on another kind of technicality, say marriages where women hold forth on Gloria Steinem at the dinner table, and nullify mine.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once again, Prime Minister Stephen Harper is saying he has “no intention” of reopening the same-sex marriage debate, just as he doesn't wish to disturb the sleeping lion of abortion. (Justice Minister Rob Nicholson said Thursday he will move to clarify the situation.) But the Harper government's actions, and those of his backbenchers – one of whom is fighting for a “personhood” law, which would challenge the right to abortion – tell another story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this scary new world, which is starting to resemble the dystopia of Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel The Handmaid's Tale, not only do most U.S. Republican candidates swear they will ban any access to abortion under any circumstances, they are even challenging the right to birth control. As legal reporter Jeffrey Toobin recently wrote in The New Yorker: “It is chilling to believe that the Constitution could allow a state to ban married couples from buying birth control” – yet that law was precisely what was discussed during a recent Republican presidential candidates debate in one pinch-me-is-this-really-2012? moment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have no idea why we have to keep saying this but we do: The so-called “family values” espoused by these decriers of modernity are, above all, exclusionist values – they want to keep people out, not bring people in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the case in the 1980s when the phrase gained traction, and it's still the case now as family values continues, in the 21st century, to be an ideological domestic fortress, built by an unsavoury alliance of bewildered but essentially well-meaning people who can't cope with the societal changes, especially within their own families, joined with bigots, religious extremists and reactionary politicians, who understand all too well that people reject what they fear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among Canada's family-values advocates is Charles McVety, a leading evangelical mover and shaker, who is spearheading a campaign against Dalton McGuinty's sex education agenda in Ontario: “PLEASE! I'm a boy, don't confuse me” implores one ad on Mr. McVety's Institute for Canadian Values website decrying “Ontario's new state-decreed morality – homosexuality.” Mr. McVety and others like him clearly hope that society can be returned to, well, the way it was, once upon a time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But guess what? The barbarians are already well inside the gates. Even in the conservative United States, a growing number of its citizens are either actively supporting same-sex marriage (like former U.S. first lady Laura Bush) or shrugging their shoulders. Who cares who can marry anyway, when you don't even have a job or a roof over your head?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And families everywhere are adjusting to their children being gay or “other,” realizing their emotional ties only get stronger when they support and accept and love each other and each other's partners, with all their differences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We need to deep-six that hoary phrase “family values” or make it so inclusive it refers to anyone – gay, straight or other – who yearns to be part of a family, with or without children, and works hard to make one happen. That's the only family “value” that matters.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sitcom Mike &amp; Molly (Mondays, CBS, 9:30 p.m.) is a hit and a rare one. Rare in two ways – it features two large people as lead characters and, perhaps most rare of all these days, it's a show that viewers feel affectionate about. It's not a cool show, it's not one that people feel fanatical about – it's a show that people cozy up with.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The leads, Billy Gardell and Melissa McCarthy, came here to talk up the show, and what ensued was a strange combination of showbiz blather and real honesty, a bit like the series itself in tone and content.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the show began airing in September, 2010, the focus was on the two characters being overweight and much of the humour was about weight and eating. Set in Chicago, the series chronicled the lives of two obese people, Mike Biggs (Gardell), a police officer who's trying to lose weight, and Molly Flynn (McCarthy), a teacher. They meet at an Overeaters Anonymous group and rather awkwardly become a couple.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That weight issue has since diminished a lot, and the show is now emphatically about people who simply look real and have something bordering on an authentic romantic relationship that seems true to life. Oh yes – they are getting married in a May sweeps episode.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a very good thing the weight issue faded on the show. The fact that a network sitcom featured large people in the main roles for the first time since NBC's Roseanne seemed to distract and irritate some commentators. The L.A. Times called the series “a potentially fine show, struggling to be free of its fat suit.” A writer for Marie Claire magazine wrote that she would be “grossed out if I had to watch two characters with rolls and rolls of fat kissing each other.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sparked an avalanche of derision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Producer Don Foster told us here: “Part of what we really wanted to do with this show is have a romantic comedy of full-grown adults, people in their mid-30s, which we thought was rare on television, who had lives that were spread wide – you know, they had co-workers, each had family.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And working-class family life plays a significant role in the show. It's true the Biggs and Flynn families are not characters who turn up occasionally. They're always there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melissa McCarthy admitted she was just hoping to get an acting job – any job – when she landed the Molly role. Since then, she has won an Emmy for her work and starred in the movie Bridesmaids, for which there's talk of an Oscar nomination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McCarthy gushed about her good fortune, and joked that she's had so much success in a short time, she thinks she's used it up. “It's all been wonderful. It's like now I'm going to be hit by a bus.” She also talked about loving going to work and about the cast and crew “just being crazy about each other.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billy Gardell was more blunt about the show, and brutally honest about his own sudden stardom. “I never went into the show thinking that the overweight thing was what it was about. It's just an element of it. But we were coming into a world where, you know, everybody on TV is 78½ pounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was really scared to do this. I mean, a 300-pound guy is going to be a romantic lead. I went, ‘Are you guys crazy?' And they convinced me that I could take this journey. And then they found Melissa, and it got better and better. Now this is a story, beyond anything else, about two people falling in love who thought they were never going to get to fall in love, and if you can't root for that, you're a little dead inside.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gardell had a career as a standup comic before Mike &amp; Molly. It wasn't thriving, but he was getting work. He was asked how Mike &amp; Molly had changed his routine, and whether he had any upcoming appearances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Same jokes cost more money now,” he wisecracked. And when the laughter stopped, he continued, “I'm very blessed in a way that when I go out to do a standup gig – I have one Saturday night in Minneapolis if you want to put that in – when I see our crowd, it's a thousand people, and 890 of them are there because of Mike &amp; Molly, not because of me. There's, like, 22 people that know I'm a standup. I know that because the last time I played in a casino before this show started, it was 65 people who had gotten a coupon to get off the floor for a little while.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that rings true, like the show itself.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a third of the way into David Cronenberg's new film A Dangerous Method, Michael Fassbender – as Swiss psychologist Carl Jung – recoils after Keira Knightley lunges to kiss him.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is generally the man who takes the initiative,” he tells Ms. Knightley's character, Jung's sex-starved, sado-masochistic patient Sabina Spielrein. Jung delivers this rebuke with an air of propriety and, as Freud might say, repression (which came off as unintentionally funny given that, the last time we saw Mr. Fassbender, in Shame, he was having sex with everything that moved).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fraulein Spielrein pauses for a moment, then responds: “Or do you think there's something male in every female and something female in every man? Or should be?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Maybe,” Jung answers. “I suppose you're right.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The film is based on a true story, which suggests that Sabina Spielrein inspired Jung's later conception of the “anima” and the “animus,” the names he gave to the feminine side of a man and vice versa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A century later, while these terms have not gained wide currency, the idea that a woman can possess “male” qualities is firmly part of Western culture. Women like Sabina Spielrein – who not only lunged toward men, but later became one of the first female psychoanalysts – and the feminists who followed took back much more than the night. They took back the right to own all sides of their personalities, even the ones only men were supposed to get.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Men haven't exactly followed suit, have we?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe we were too busy worrying about how the change in women would affect us, but it's time we caught up. Men embracing their feminine side is the natural next step of human psychological evolution. Sure, we're already parenting much more actively and one-arm hugging each other more often, but I still feel we've only half-embraced the idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deep down, are we as comfortable putting on ballet shoes as we are swinging a hammer? Are we okay hammering in ballet shoes while putting lotions on our big biceps and weeping? No, we are not. Okay, I realize that hammering while dancing will be difficult, but you get my point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Women want us to be sensitive and in tune with our feelings but also still be strong and protective and be able to work hard,” I often hear men complain. “They should make up their minds!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is silly. It's true women may be asking for two things, but it's only two things. Last time I checked, men have dominated the field of higher mathematics for decades, so we're certainly capable of figuring out how to combine two sides of our personality. Shouldn't the one-dimensional man be a relic of the 20th century?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I guess I'm biased, because Jung's concept of the anima did once get me laid. My stepfather, who met my mother at a seminar for Jungians, advised me in my late teens that I would have better luck with the ladies if I embraced my inner woman. This would, he explained, transform me from a guy lusting out of a feeling of lacking something – I was still a virgin – into a man made whole, empowered not only by my own sexuality, but by the female side of my nature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He suggested I try an exercise to see what he meant: “Pretend to be the woman that you are attracted to and see how you'll feel different.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One night, I told a close female friend about this assignment and then, half joking and half drunk, vamped it up on her balcony, role-playing the foxy women I observed on the streets of Montreal. It may not be true for all men, but it turned out my anima was comical and into disco. Acting it out helped me lose my sense of something missing. A few hours later, I lost it in the sack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the late Christopher Hitchens has said, simply making a girl laugh – as I did that night – will get you laid plenty, but I also came to realize that there is an alluring quality to a man who can be a man and also be a woman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even a man who can simply laugh at the idea of “being a man” is more attractive than one who can't. (Those who disagree are clearly incapable of doing it.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the opposite sex, I've always been most attracted to tomboy princesses like Leia in the third Star Wars, who changes out of her gold bikini and into camo to ride her hover-motorcycle. The first girl I fell in love with at summer camp had a short haircut and rode horses like a cowboy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some spiritual types – including latter-day Jungians – claim that the rumoured 2012 apocalypse is actually going to be a massive shift in consciousness. If these sages are correct, it could very well mean more men will be willing to let out their inner disco bunny, as they wipe their tears away with a hammer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the showbiz world discovered Junie Hoang, née Huong Hoang, an actress who launched a suit against the Internet Movie Database and its parent company, Amazon, for more than a million dollars. Hoang says the company revealed her age (40) without her permission on its “IMDbPro” subscription service.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suit is an amended version of an early suit from last October, which Hoang tried to do anonymously, fearing backlash from the entertainment industry. The defendants' lawyers called her case “selfish, contrary to the public interest and a frivolous abuse of this court's resources.” IMDb offered no apologies for getting her age from credit-card data when she paid for a subscription.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story of the anonymous actress and her lawsuit sounded like a terrific publicity stunt. Gawker.com turned the attempts to guess her identity into an online game, working with these details – an Asian-American woman, from Texas, aged 40, using an Americanized version of her name. But nobody got it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a judge threatened to throw out her case unless she used her real name, Hoang finally stepped into the spotlight. According to IMDbPro, she was born in Saigon in 1971, though her resumé lists her age range as between 26 and 33.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with a lot of minor TV work and modelling in the last two decades, she's been in some silly-sounding movies such as the recent Gingerdead Man III: Saturday Night Cleaver. What can't be laughed off so easily is how much her charge has resonated with actors' groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two heavyweight unions, the 200,000-member Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the 80,000-member American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) came to the then-unnamed actress's defence in October, denouncing IMDb's policy: “An actor's actual age is irrelevant to casting. What matters is the age range that an actor can portray. For the entire history of professional acting, this has been true, but that reality has been upended by the development of IMDb as an industry standard used in casting offices across America.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Friday, SAG issued another statement praising Hoang for her courage in “standing up to fight the unfair and abusive practice of publishing actors' private information online without their consent.” The organization says thousands of actors have been hurt by IMDb's unauthorized publication of their ages, particularly women. According to the union, women over 40 make up 24.3 per cent of the U.S. population, but actresses over 40 get just 12.5 per cent of movie and television roles, while men are proportionally represented. Using legal remedies against age discrimination has become increasingly popular in the United States. Two years ago, a class action by writers over 40 ended in a $70-million settlement paid out by 17 networks and production studios, putting an end to a practice of hiring young writers for television to capture young viewers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if Hoang's suit fails, she's both drawn attention to the issue and done wonders for her profile. The Hollywood Reporter said that Today, Good Morning America, E! and other TV outlets, as well as Peoplemagazine have all been clamouring for interviews. Hoang has declined, insisting she's not in this for publicity. Still, some sharpie at HBO or Showtime must be drafting the script for her story already. We start way back in 1971, during the wind-down of the Vietnam War, also the year Ms. Magazine first appeared as an insert in New York magazine. Huang can easily play herself as a struggling actress through her 20s and 30s, but then there's that perceived age-range problem: Judging by her IMDb photograph, she looks far too young to play 40.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reader writes: After 28 years of marriage, my wife told me a year ago she no longer loved me and wanted me to leave. After months of trying to get her into counselling (she suffers from intermittent explosive disorder), and tired of years of being assaulted and belittled in front of our three daughters, I finally left. I was a hard-working and loving husband, with no issues with substance abuse or anything that would provoke such outbursts. Now I am starting a new life in a new relationship. When I mentioned this to one of my daughters, I was accused of moving on too soon. All three of my daughters, who grew up witnessing my wife's treatment of me and have begun to emulate it, now refuse to speak to me. How can I find closure?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remain a loving father</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think you should point out that their mother got exactly what she asked for. Also point out the things you had to endure. And then state that perhaps you should have moved on even sooner than you did. Regarding closure, nothing you do will change the fact that you are their father. They may not be talking to you now, but leave the door open. And don't forget to tell them that you love them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– Peter Stern, Toronto</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't shame their mother</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't believe closure is the goal; rather it should be helping your daughters understand adult behaviour by being consistent, considerate and kind. Hoping they take into account your ex's treatment of you is not the way to go. That shames their mother in their eyes and that's a losing proposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– Bryan Fader, Halifax</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Move past being a doormat</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your female kin have stamped and wiped their feet on someone quite tolerant and resilient. Closure is usually embedded in what opens up ahead of us. You risk replicating the maltreatment theme unless you get help learning to identify, expect and evaluate healthy ways in which influence and control are played out. As you welcome a new relationship into your life and heart, ensure you don't put out the same doormat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– Bob Burgoyne, Montreal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE FINAL WORD</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Peter says, you gave your wife precisely what she asked for, and it sounds like this is all you've ever tried to do. But trashing your wife to win the favour of your daughters is not exactly the high road. In your wife's case, of course, character assassination amounts to no more than an honest recounting of how she has behaved throughout your marriage. Still, don't go there. Moving forward means accepting whatever part you played in those 28 miserable years and refusing to dwell or lay blame. You did your best, your best wasn't enough, and now it's over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As to your daughters. Keep in mind, they've spent their whole lives watching you sacrifice your own happiness. When you set people up to expect a certain type of behaviour – “doormat” in Bob's coinage – they tend not to respond well to sudden deviations. No one expects the doormat to stand upright, shake itself off and amble down the street to seek its own happiness. “But we liked it where it was!” exclaim your outraged daughters. “Why is the doormat being such a jerk?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not exactly their fault that they've come to view you this way, but now that you've repudiated the martyr role, the ladies need to grow up and recognize not everything is about them. You have to stand firm, upright doormat! Say you did the best you could, but by mutual agreement, you and your ex are just that. Tell them you haven't been happy for a long time, and now at last you are. Say you love them and you hope they can be happy for you. Call and e-mail them every week, whether they respond or not. And never apologize. Make it clear you are their father and you have every intention of remaining in their lives – just not under their feet.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEXT WEEK'S QUESTION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A close friend of 20 years abruptly told me two years ago (via e-mail!) that she was doing some “deep soul searching” and asked me to stop contacting her. She said she “valued our friendship” and would be in touch. Stunned, I said I'd be here when she was ready – but there's been no contact. Now I learn that she has put our mutual friends in the middle, refusing to attend functions if I'm to be there. Should I contact her before all my friendships are compromised?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where and when is equality realized? What steps are required to make it concrete? Those are the bigger questions I draw from Thursday's wild ride over the federal government's position on foreign gay and lesbian couples who wed in Canada.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It began with a story in The Globe and Mail about a new position advanced by the federal government. It arose in a case concerning a challenge to the rule requiring 12 months of residency before divorce proceedings can be launched in a Canadian province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawyers and scholars have known for years that the residency requirement would cause headaches for foreign couples. Thousands of them have flocked to Canada to marry since the first legal weddings at Toronto City Hall in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What nobody expected was that the federal government would deploy rules from a highly complex body of law called conflict of laws in order to undercut the equal-marriage provisions of which many Canadians, gay or straight, are rightly proud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no need for divorce, the government's lawyer suggested – there isn't any marriage to begin with if the parties couldn't have married in their home country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A firestorm of outrage greeted the story and, by afternoon, Justice Minister Rob Nicholson felt the need to respond, insisting that the government has no intention of reopening the marriage debate. He promised to investigate options to clarify the law so marriages done in Canada can be undone in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Stephen Harper said on Thursday he was unaware of what his lawyers were doing in this case. The charitable reading is that someone in the Department of Justice simply made a gaffe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those of us outraged by the initial news story in this matter may be heaving a sigh of relief, warily. But the need for caution remains. For one thing, it remains unknown what options the minister will consider and what will result.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For another, what's plain is that, even after a big victory such as same-sex marriage, equality can be eroded in incremental, bureaucratic ways. The big idea of equal marriage in Canada, associated with legal victories several years ago, needs to be sustained and protected over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Parliament passed the Civil Marriage Act in 2005, the federal government of the day didn't systematically review all the laws and policies that might need adjustment. The result is that legal problems for married gays and lesbians have persisted in administrative areas, such as immigration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parliament may have passed a law, but its intent is thwarted if changes aren't also made in the policy manuals by which laws are made real. Equality is also thwarted if government lawyers don't absorb the principles underlying that law into their conduct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's worth noting that the Harper government's lawyers are also involved in another matter that risks passing under the radar as a technicality. It concerns same-sex relationships formalized abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, Britain legislated for gay equality by creating the civil partnership. The government there says a civil partnership is equal to marriage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Canadian citizen who had a civil partnership in Britain is seeking recognition of his relationship under Canadian law. The Ontario government raises no objection, but the federal government is intervening, at taxpayers' expense, to oppose recognizing the civil partnership as equivalent to a same-sex marriage performed in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's action undermines Britain's efforts to recognize the equality of same-sex relationships, but the Justice Minister has issued no public justification for his policy in that case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As other groups have learned, equality is not something achieved in a moment of legal victory. It needs to be fought for repeatedly, in many contexts, over time. It requires vigilance and persistence, and all Canadians have a stake in making sure that our government doesn't use technicalities to undermine it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's good fun but just once you'd like Brian Burke to stow the righteous indignation and stop picking fights with shadows. As the much-discussed recent Sports Illustrated players poll shows, his sacred duty to turn the Toronto Maple Leafs into the most hated team in the NHL, as opposed to the most pitied, is proceeding apace.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not necessarily mission accomplished, because hate alone won't get you into the playoffs, let alone through the first round. It's one thing to be hated because people respect your players and don't particularly like playing your team, another because your team has spent a decade punching under its weight, your coach was voted in another poll as the coach players would least like to play for – and because there are unborn generations who will go to their graves believing there is an inherent bias toward you on the part of every national broadcaster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's a start, no?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burke made it fairly clear when he took over as general manager of the Maple Leafs that one of the signs of a turnaround would be when the Leafs stopped making people collapse to the floor in spasms of laughter and instead had them scowling and raging. And it must seem achingly close: The Edmonton Oilers are a sexy, young team stuck in neutral, the Calgary Flames are maybe one step in front of the Grim Reaper and coached by a Sutter, the Winnipeg Jets disappear on the road and the Montreal Canadiens have imploded and are a theatre of dysfunction in two languages. Cover your eyes, Leafs haters, (the fingers cramp up at the very thought of typing the following words), but other than the Vancouver Canucks … could it be that the Leafs are just maybe, possibly … you know … the second-best team in the country?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You'll get a fight in Ottawa from Senators fans, and fair play to them. Truthfully, both Senators and Leafs fans have more reason for optimism than usual because let's face it: Other than the Boston Bruins, is there a team in the Eastern Conference that you'd be deathly afraid of facing in the playoffs? Not right now there isn't; not even the New York Rangers. The nightmare scenario for Ontario's teams might be facing each other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It sets up beautifully for the all-star game in Ottawa in two weeks time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dion Phaneuf, No. 1 among overrated players on the aforementioned poll, has been voted on as a starter. Joffrey Lupul and Phil Kessel will be there with him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burke was on Sportsnet 590 The Fan's Prime Time Sports on Wednesday (full disclosure: I'm the host of a show on the same station) and he was in full Irish, dropping goodies about being willing to trade his first-round pick at the deadline if it will expedite the acquisition of a big forward (the guess here is he'll get a deal before the deadline, and that when it's done, one of either Luke Schenn or Nazem Kadri will be gone). He also suggested he wants to have a mano-a-mano discussion with Alex Ovechkin about the way he picked on Kessel during the player draft at the all-star game last year and suggested he likes Toronto enough to stick around after he's finished his GM's gig. Burke is leading with his chin as always, and if you're already sick of the sound and fury, wait and see what happens if his team follows. Enjoy the Leafs hatred, but know it means Burke has you exactly where he wants you.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Brad Pitt needs a valentine for Angelina Jolie, I have just the idea: a bound copy of the first draft of her screenplay for her debut film as a writer-director, In the Land of Blood and Honey (which opens in Canada on Friday). It would be a touching, romantic gesture, because the script is a mess – typographically, that is.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm bad with computers,” Jolie said in a recent phone interview. “I didn't even have [screenwriting program] Final Draft when I was writing it. So to do dialogue I was typing space-space-space. It took me a really long time, until somebody explained to me I could get a writing program. So the first draft is all over the place.” She laughs. “It's so unprofessional.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her laugh is warm, self-deprecating, and not unusual in the course of our call. And disarming, since I'd expected Jolie to be a bit aloof, and her answers canned. After all, she's Angelina freakin' Jolie – at 36, an Oscar-winning movie star (for Girl, Interrupted), tattooed mother of six, United Nations Goodwill Ambassador, and one of the most famous (and hounded) women on the planet. Reams have been written about her sex life, her knife play and the his-and-hers blood vials she and Billy Bob Thornton once sported. Lately, Jolie's more regal side has emerged, all emerald drop earrings, sightseeing in Venice with her brood, and lounging in Louis Vuitton ads modelling luxury camo-mufti in Cambodia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of a she-devil or ice queen, however, Jolie sounded friendly and eager to communicate, almost as if she were still parsing out the film's issues for herself. In the Land of Blood and Honey, a tortured love story set during the Bosnian war, and up for best foreign-language film at Sunday's Golden Globes, is a tough sell, and Jolie has been chatting it up for months already – including to Barack Obama, during a visit to the White House with Pitt on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bound script would be a good companion, Jolie agrees – “when I feel more confident and I'm not as embarrassed” – to the writing present Pitt has already given her: an antique typewriter. “Brad is the first person who read the script,” she says, “and the first person to tell me that it was good. And believe in me. He produces films, and he's such a solid man and solid actor.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, she admits, there was a “slight adjustment” in their household as she added writer and director to her résumé. “I would sit up writing late into the night,” Jolie says. “It wasn't a joke in our house, but it was this odd experiment I was doing that seemed so unusual for both of us. I'd written op-ed pieces and in journals, but nothing like this. But like anybody who loves you, they're happy when you're happy. I think Brad's happy that there's something that brings me some peace.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she started writing, Jolie wasn't planning to make a film, or even to show anyone her work. “I wrote out of a quiet meditation with myself, about my own frustrations with violence against women, lack of intervention in crises, and trying to understand what happens to people in war.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vuitton ads aside, Jolie does walk the walk: She uses that army of reporters who trail her to shed light on war-torn regions, where she sleeps in tents, cradles babies and advocates for women's and children's safety, not unlike Audrey Hepburn before her (though fewer people questioned Hepburn's sincerity). Yes, not many first-time directors can include the White House on their promotional tour. But not many screen their films at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The more I read about the Balkan conflict, the more I felt compelled to learn,” Jolie goes on. “It slowly formed into a project.” She made a wager with herself: If she could pull together a cast and crew from all sides of the conflict, and they thought her story rang true, she would make the film. In it, a budding relationship between Ajla (Zana Marjanovic), a Muslim artist, and Danijel (Goran Kostic), a Serbian soldier, is literally blown asunder by the civil war in 1992 Yugoslavia. She becomes a captive in a women's prison camp that he runs, and their relationship mutates against a backdrop of rape, murder and brutality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project was nearly swamped early on when misreports of the plot – suggesting that the leads fell in love after Danijel raped Ajla – led female victims of war to protest the film. But Jolie persevered, financing much of the $13-million (U.S.) budget with her and Pitt's own funds. She shot two full versions, one in English (so it can be used as an educational tool, and for those who dislike subtitles) and the other in Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian. (That's the version she prefers.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a universal and human story, not a political statement,” Jolie says. “There are so many wonderful artists in that part of the world, and none want to be divided. Their coming together to do this” – she earns extra points for good grammar there – “was such a beautiful thing. I felt responsible to them to try to protect that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the script is light on dialogue, Jolie had her reasons: “I'm a big believer in behaviour and what's not said. It is sparse, but part of that is because of how careful especially Ajla had to be with what she said. And it was important to me to show humanity on Danijel's side, too. To try to understand that most people aren't born hateful and violent – that they both become something unrecognizable by the end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They both had to make a decision that so many did in that war,” she continues, very earnest now. “This nationalism rose up, and people changed. People who were neighbours, friends, family. The two leads were born in the same hospital, they went to the same school, they were taught the same history. Now he has to check the box ‘Serb' and she has to check the box ‘Other,' because her parents are a mixed marriage. And their children would now go to separate schools, with separate histories.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On-set, Jolie tried to encourage an open, familial atmosphere where everyone was invited to contribute. “I don't want to walk on-set and be The Director,” she says. “I want to walk on-set and be Angie, who's coming in with strong ideas and will keep things moving. But I'm going to be a friend that anybody can be honest with. Even if it's ‘I hate this line.' The directors that I've had bad experiences with are the ones who separate themselves and don't listen. Or only listen to the lead actor.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She depicts the near-constant scenes of violence unflinchingly, but shot them apologetically. “We had this running thing where I'd say, ‘Let's try to have an easy scene on Monday,' and everybody would say, ‘What easy scene? You don't have any of those,' ” Jolie remembers. Asking an actress to run through Sniper Alley in Sarajevo, Jolie knew that in real life, the actress had made that very run, and been shot at, regularly. And the rape scenes were tough on both actors in the equation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the hardest scene for Jolie to helm was one in which soldiers force elderly women to dance naked. Her research had taught her it was a true occurrence, and she planned to shoot just one take, with two cameras. But on shooting day, “it felt like I was personally torturing people,” Jolie says. “I was so uncomfortable and so apologetic. But the women were strong for me – they told me they wanted to show this, they wanted people to understand what women in war go through.” Still, Jolie endured a lot of sleepless nights – “many,” she says. “I'm still not sleeping.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now she's in the throes of full-scale awards-season stumping. But Jolie is hardly unfamiliar with being dissected publicly. I tell her I can't imagine what it would feel like if millions of strangers had opinions about me. “Well, thank you,” she replies. “I've felt that for so long – since I've been working with the UN, which is 11 years – I guess I'm just used to it. It's not that it doesn't bother me, but it's so par for the course that there's no way around it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think it keeps me extra centred on doing things from the heart and for the right reasons,” she continues. “If you do that, you have the strength to stay straight. Nobody's opinion of you affects you or unnerves you, because you just know. So maybe in some way it has strengthened me, to clarify my own sense of who I am, no matter how somebody sees me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She laughs again, but not at herself this time. “People say to me, ‘Growing up, you were this kind of woman, and now you're that kind of woman.' I think, ‘God, if you knew anything about women, you'd know we're all things.' That's what makes a woman, truly.” Jolie pauses for a nanosecond, and when she drops her final line, I can hear her grin. “It's usually not women who ask me that.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years back, I published a novel that had some bad words in it. It wasn't an X-rated book, but the characters spoke the way people in real life do, which is to say they occasionally dropped the f-bomb and the s-bomb. In the months after publication I received many reactions. These ranged from “I couldn't put it down” to “Give me my money back,” but most bafflingly common were the people who felt the need to ask me, in a slightly wincing tone, “Exactly why did you feel it was necessary to put the f-word on page 73?”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I soon gave up literary justifications and took to engaging in that most Canadian of social responses: the profuse, if mildly disingenuous, apology. Sometimes, if the complainant happened to have the book handy, I'd even scratch out the bad word. It's not that I believe in censorship, just that I dislike offending people. “There,” I'd say, handing the book back, “now it's perfectly safe for your 11-year-old daughter.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The issue of what sort of language and imagery is appropriate for children (and the general public) was at the U.S. Supreme Court this week. The case centres around multimillion-dollar FCC fines against Fox and ABC for, respectively, prime-time swearing and nudity. The first instance involved Cher, and later Nicole Richie, dropping the f-word on Fox during the live broadcast of the Billboard Music Awards Show; the second was in response to a bare bum shot on the then-hit ABC series NYPD Blue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broadcasters' lawyers argued that the FCC's current no-naughtiness-in-prime-time policy is vague and unfairly prevents them from competing with unregulated cable and satellite TV. While the court isn't expected to rule until June, the debate made for interesting reading. Chief Justice John Roberts, the only judge with small children, argued vehemently in favour of upholding the FCC ruling: “What the government is asking for, is a few channels where… they are not going to hear the s-word, the f-word, they are not going to see nudity.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here in Canada we like a good wardrobe malfunction, by which I mean getting our knickers in a knot over foul language. Last year, rock fans were outraged when the CRTC banned Dire Straits'Money For Nothing from radio because a listener noticed (presumably for the first time since the song was released in 1985) that the lyrics contained another f-word, a derogatory term for gay men. Several months later, NDP Pat Martin caused a furor when he sent out several obscenity-laden tweets about the Harper government. When CBC.ca later asked site visitors whether they thought Martin was out of line, a whopping 69 per cent of respondents said no. Despite this, the Ceeb (like this newspaper and others), did not print the words in question for fear of causing offence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to whom? In censoring themselves, broadcasters and newspapers seem to respect some universal standard of propriety. Likewise in the United States, the FCC is tasked with protecting “community standards.” Yet by the time the Supreme Court defines those standards, the issue will be all but moot. Today, nearly nine out of ten American households subscribe to cable or satellite television; the case applies only to over-the-air transmissions. In the digital landscape, there is no censor – self-regulation is the only way to avoid infinite possibilities to be offended. Unlike the days when we all sat down and watched what was “on,” today we actively connect to entertainment and choose – and un-choose – all manner of uncomfortable or titillating material.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I actually find it sweetly quaint that in an era of free on-demand digital porn, Kardashians and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> suicides, most of the mainstream media (this newspaper included) censors itself to the extent that we do. This self-repression, for the most part, comes from a genuine unwillingness to offend rather than any kind of deep-seated cultural repression. I see the need for a good cuss word in real life as much as the next gal, but, as I learned with my book, it's often hardly worth the trouble. Unfortunately for Fox, Cher and Nicole Richie can't eat their words, but as a novelist I still have my trusty pen. It's not efficient, but I'll continue to scribble out my swearwords one offended reader and retroactive bleep at a time.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The source of Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver's ideas – of a conspiracy between “environmental and other radical groups” that are working with “foreign special-interest groups” and “jet-setting celebrities” to prevent Canada from completing “any major project” – appears to be our Prime Minister.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking in Vancouver last November, Stephen Harper said, “I think we'll see significant American interests trying to line up against the Northern Gateway project, precisely because it's not in the interests of the United States. It's in the interests of Canada. … They'll funnel money through environmental groups and others in order to try to slow it down.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Oliver's addition of the threat of “jet-setting celebrities” is a charmingly anachronistic touch, as if the rest of us still travel by boat or biplane. Unless of course he means actual jet-setting celebrities, from the age of the jet set. They are mostly dead now. Does the minister fear that Canada's industries are under attack by Zombie Sammy Davis Jr.? Even if that is what Mr. Oliver means, Mr. Harper's is still the more paranoid suggestion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harper insists that international environmental groups are working together, targeting individual projects, specifically to undermine our national sovereignty. Which is bizarre enough because, honestly, when has the left ever reached a consensus on anything? Is nobody infiltrating these groups?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They do some fine work, but I wouldn't want to be the one forced to organize the United Groups of the Left Potluck. It would take 122 votes just to agree on who was going to bring the tabbouleh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, more strangely, Mr. Harper also wants us to trust him that these environmentalists are working hand in hand with American politicians and businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are we meant to believe that the environmental groups' massive outcry against the Keystone XL pipeline (which apparently led U.S. President Barack Obama to delay the project) was an elaborately staged ploy? That environmentalists defeated the Keystone pipeline that their secret masters wanted, because it would have brought oil to the United States, only so that later they would have the credibility to defeat the Gateway pipeline their secret masters oppose, because it threatens to take Canadian oil elsewhere?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That seems unlikely. But perhaps that conflict is when these two once-opposing parties met.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the distant past of the past few years, when the Canadian government was not as delicate about foreign intervention as they're claiming to be now, they lobbied hard for the approval of Keystone, as did the American oil industry, both against the environmental groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Really, you would have thought these last two had nothing in common. You would have thought that they hated each other! Why, I'll bet that when that free-spirited, winsome creature (with a touch of fire about her) that is the Environmental Movement met that staid, goal-oriented, grey-suited entity that is American Big Oil, you could have cut the tension with a knife.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then I'll bet the Environmental Movement did something maddeningly endearing with her pen in a meeting, before she spilled the contents of her purse, and then while American Big Oil helped her pick up her things, he said something witty and self-deprecating – perhaps about the mess he made in the Gulf of Mexico. And then they had a moment, and then they had a fight, and then eventually they had sex on the desk and the Canadian lobbyists walked in on them in the middle of it, which was kind of hilarious, and you guessed it – yes, it's worse than we imagined: This whole thing is just another crappy American romcom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They fell in love, American Big Oil and the Environmental Movement, and apparently they've decided that, as different as they are, they both really hate Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's right, Canada. They hate the “Canadian families” that Joe Oliver has vowed to protect – all those families sitting on shovel-ready oil wells in their backyards, under the skating rink that dad makes every winter – families being prevented from realizing their dream by the entire cast of the Gillette Cavalcade of Stars, who now eat brains because they were brought back to life by the unlikely pairing of American Big Oil and the Environmental Movement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Help us, Mr. Oliver! Help us, Mr. Harper! Do something! We've seen the road-trip segment and the missing-each-other montage. Now do something before we have to see the bit where she helps him reconnect with his dad.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conservative government defended that institution – promptly and unequivocally. As a result, same-sex marriage cannot be diminished or sent to the back of the bus by this party or that party. It is the law of Canada, from here on to be staunchly defended by the government of Canada. (Including the Justice Department.)</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justice Minister Rob Nicholson did the right and necessary thing in making absolutely clear that gay marriages of foreigners in Canada are legal – including the thousands already married here, and those who may marry in the future. Also important, he said he understood the pain and confusion that have been caused. And he will not let legal technicalities, even long-standing legal principles, whether residency requirements or the “law of domicile,” stand in the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The message, then, is not that gay marriage has to fit into the pre-existing framework of laws, but that the legal framework has to be made to fit gay marriage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Justice Department, for reasons still obscure, did not understand this when it argued, in a lesbian divorce case, that the marriage itself did not exist because, in the places the two women came from (Florida and England), gay marriage was not legal. Although Mr. Nicholson blamed a “legislative gap” left by the Liberal prime minister Paul Martin, who rewrote the Civil Marriage Act to include same-sex marriage, the Justice Department's response to that gap was grossly unfair and, in its effect, discriminatory. (The department, not Mr. Martin, caused the pain and confusion.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, gay marriage didn't fit the existing international framework. Most countries have never contemplated gay marriage. Some observers in the legal community actually argued that the “law of domicile” (the ability to marry where one lives) and one-year residency requirements for divorce treat heterosexuals and homosexuals equally. Mr. Nicholson, thankfully, did not ignore the real-world context that made nonsense of this mechanistic view of equality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada, more sturdily than ever after this topsy-turvy week, gay marriage is the law of the land.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Desperate Housewives (Sunday, ABC, CTV, 9 p.m.) has never exactly explored the darkest areas of human experience. But the show did strike a chord, and an emphatic one.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, it begat an entire cultural phenomenon – one focusing on housewives real and imagined. And well, catfights, shenanigans and shopping. That is not to dismiss Desperate Housewives or all that followed it. All those Real Housewives shows owe their existence to it. At the core of the phenomenon was the recognition that middle-class housewives are often repressed; inevitably, what is repressed bursts forth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I remember well the pilot episode. It was the summer of 2004. And when I was about to write the guide to upcoming new shows, an editor suggested the return of The Apprentice would be the big event. I countered with an assertion that this new series would be the biggest thing in years. It was. And now the end is nigh. The sun will set on Wisteria Lane. The current and eighth season of Desperate Housewives will be its last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The entire cast and the show's creator, Marc Cherry, came here to meet the critics, reminisce and say goodbye. The stage was full: Ricardo Chavira (Carlos Solis), Eva Longoria (his wife, Gabrielle), James Denton (Mike Delfino), Teri Hatcher (his sometimes-wife, Susan), Felicity Huffman (Lynette Scavo), Doug Savant (her husband, Tom), Marcia Cross (Bree Van De Kamp), Vanessa Williams (Renée Perry) and producer Bob Daily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All knew they had been involved in something significant. All were grateful for the success and attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most grateful was Cherry. A roly-poly man who talks in a kind of gosh-golly style, he talked about the writing of the original pilot. He'd worked as a writer on Golden Girls in the 1980s and then fell on hard times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was a hundred thousand dollars in debt to my mother. I went through years without an interview for a job. No one thought I was anything. People who were friends didn't even call for a while. And then, like, I write this script because it was my attempt to show people that I was a better writer than maybe they thought, and all hell broke loose.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the subject of the Real Housewives shows came up, he joked, “I want residuals!” But, of course, Cherry is now a very wealthy man. In 2007, it was estimated that his creation was the most-watched U.S. network show in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“At the end of the first season,” recalled Cherry, “I went to London on vacation, where I kind of just collapsed in a hotel room. And they delivered my paper, and I opened it up. And the play Hedda Gabler was playing, and the first line of the review was ‘The original desperate housewife.' I'm like, ‘Oh, my God.' Now I hope that whatever impact it has had socially, for the most part, it's a positive one.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show had outrageous soap-opera plot twists. As Denton said about his plumber character, “I've been in jail. I've been out of jail. I was run over by a car. I was in a coma. I was married and divorced and married.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's been a lot of death, lust and silliness, but always a psychological truth to the show. This season has shown the strain on the marriage of Tom and Lynette Scavo. Always the most solidly married of couples, their separation has come about organically and logically. “I didn't think we were ever going to be able to split Tom and Lynette up, because that relationship was so treasured, and so a lot of the fans really related to it,” Cherry said. “That was one that I didn't expect, didn't think we could get away with. And the fans have gone with it this year, which has been nice.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There wasn't time for every actor to name a favourite scene, but Hatcher got in a mention of the time her scatterbrained Susan got locked out of her house, naked. “It's really hard to beat the ‘naked in the bushes' scene. … There was a new wardrobe girl on-set. Her name was Susan. It's six in the morning. She says, ‘Can we please take some gaffer's tape and cover your nipples and your crotch?'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And we walk to the set, and I was in a robe, and it was going to be six hours of shooting this from every angle. So I just took off my robe in front of the 60 crew and said, ‘Everyone, take a good look.' And then we just moved on. It was so bonding.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cherry said he will make a Hitchcock-style cameo appearance in the final episode. But he dismissed the idea of a Desperate Housewives movie, citing the Sex and the City movies as a reason for not doing it. That's wise. Desperate Housewives arrived just as Sex and the City stopped airing. “After eight years, boy, I think we're done,” Cherry concluded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">True, but well done to him and all involved.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INSIDE THE TV RACKET</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Truth</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cable is where the action is. “I think House of Lies is incredibly timely,” says David Nevins, head of Showtime. “It's about everything that's messed up with American capitalism.” The show, a corrosive satire of management companies, which airs Mondays on TMN, last week achieved astonishing ratings for a hardnosed cable series – which suggests cable viewers are willing to question capitalism. Later the same day, producer John Wells said the major broadcast networks would now be too timid to buy some of his previous hits: “It took us a long time to sell West Wing at the time, and I think it would be completely impossible to sell it now to network television.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hype</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Old ideas die hard. The CW is the little network that relies on shows aimed at young women – Gossip Girl, Vampire Diaries, Hart of Dixie and others. It also seems to hold firm to the idea that young women will always fall for a bad boy. Or a “badass guy,” as they call such figures. On Thursday, there was a panel called Badass Boys of the CW. Actor Wilson Bethel, who takes his shirt off very often on Hart of Dixie, was asked about a previous report which said he writes poetry. He was outraged: “I only write poetry when I'm riding my motorcycle smoking weed, chasing rattlesnakes.” He was kidding, but only a little.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vancouver city councillor Tim Stevenson is hoping to fulfill one of his campaign promises next week with a motion to create a database that will shine a spotlight on the city's worst landlords.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stevenson first floated the idea during the civic election campaign in October.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The online database will allow renters to easily look up an apartment building's history and check work orders, property violations and maintenance records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea is borrowed from a bad-landlord watch list compiled by New York City's public advocate, Bill de Blasio. In a news release last month, Mr. de Blasio noted, “The innovative website will soon be adopted as a model by the City of Vancouver, British Columbia to hold landlords there more accountable.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's most astonishing about this is not the fact that four months after a campaign promise, Mr. Stevenson's motion is on council's agenda. It's not even that Vancouver was mentioned in a news release issued by the second-most powerful official in New York City (making us officially world class).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No, even more astonishing is the fact that New York City has a public advocate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I want one of these.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. de Blasio is New York City's third public advocate since the position was created in 1993. He served previously as a city councillor and as a school-board member. He also managed Hillary Rodham Clinton's successful campaign for the U.S. Senate in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not an apolitical position, such as the Vancouver city manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is elected and along with the mayor and the city's comptroller occupies one of three positions elected by all five boroughs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is a Democrat who once received a shout out on The West Wing when Rob Lowe's character could be seen standing in front of a whiteboard on which the words “Call B. De Blasio” were written.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His official job description: The public advocate serves as an ombudsman for city government, providing oversight for city agencies, investigating citizens' complaints about city services and making proposals to address perceived shortcomings or failures of those services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond sniffing out the city's worst landlords, Mr. de Blasio has a lot on his plate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week alone he has commented on the Iranian nuclear threat, the anniversary of the earthquake in Haiti; he has denounced the sale of swastika earrings at a jewellery store in Brooklyn and urged New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to adopt a living-wage bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, he clashed with Mr. Bloomberg over the mayor's refusal to end a program that required the fingerprinting of people who receive food stamps. “This is an inhumane and ineffective policy, which is why every jurisdiction besides New York City and Arizona has dropped it as a requirement,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Iran, he applauded the passing of the Iran Divestment Act of 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the swastika earrings, he wrote: “It is absolutely abhorrent that any New York business would seek to profit off of hate, anti-Semitism, and intolerance. There are no excuses for this brand of ignorance.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report on small businesses and job creation released in November, he criticized the city's heavy-handedness when it came to levying fines against shopkeepers for minor bylaw violations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there is the housing issue. Along with shaming landlords into repairing their buildings, Mr. de Blasio has proposed minimum fines for landlords who fail to address serious issues, such as peeling lead paint or a lack of heat in buildings. The measures are part of his eight-point plan to make rental housing safer. At the same time, he contended landlords need to be made aware of government-sponsored programs that could help them carry out repairs. He also said they should be rewarded when they make improvements. The reward, in version 2.0 of the “Worst Landlords” registry, is that they get special mention as owners who have earned their way off the list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back here at home, Mr. Stevenson said he wants to be less confrontational. His list of bad landlords won't include single-room occupancy hotels or rental suites in private homes, which make up a substantial portion of Vancouver's rental stock, along with rented condos. The list will be limited to, for now, the city's 4,900 purpose-built rental buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowhere in Mr. Stevenson's motion is there a reference to penalties for offending landlords, and history shows the city has been shy to use its standards-of-maintenance bylaw when it comes to compelling landlords to make repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, this may be nothing more than a feel-good exercise, and as long as the rental apartment market remains as tight as it is, renters may look past the minor, or even major, sins to put a roof over their heads.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's say you decide to host a dinner party with some of the world's most powerful and eloquent urban thinkers and designers. On the table for discussion: urban poverty, sustainability and exploding populations, along with questions like what provokes the architectural magic that can zap a city, and what qualities make people reject public space or stay to luxuriate for hours in it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Organizing an epic dinner party is how New York filmmaker Gary Hustwit first conceived of his enlightening and sumptuous film Urbanized, which premiered last fall at the Toronto International Film Festival, and which returns (in a newly re-edited version) to the TIFF Bell Lightbox this weekend along with the other films in Hustwit's trilogy of design documentaries, Helvetica (2007) and Objectified (2009). Naturally, every politician in Canada should attend, especially Rob Ford, who runs the nation's largest city as if it were a dollar store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Urbanized is an intellectual breaking of bread that takes place in dozens of cities, in which more than 30 experts reveal their inner, mostly optimistic thoughts about the state of 21st-century urbanity, their voices providing the narrative for gorgeous visuals of London's skyline, the veil of smog obscuring Beijing and Rio de Janeiro's clearing house of urban data with more screens than Nasdaq. Even Toronto is captured in the film's opening sequence, with a helicopter buzzing a path in front of the dense mass of waterfront condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike a raucous dinner party with its soundtrack of competing voices, Urbanized allows us to tune into carefully articulated declarations and some fighting words. Among the speakers, there are the likely suspects, such as British starchitect Norman Foster (the brains behind the gherkin-shaped <span class="companylink">Swiss Re</span> tower in London and the University of Toronto's Leslie Dan Pharmacy Building), who clearly enjoys his mellifluous voice though he doesn't really manage to say much, and Copenhagen's Jan Gehl, the gentle knight crusading for a softer, more sensory public space that embraces pedestrians and bicycles. Dutch superstar architect Rem Koolhaas blows off steam about the energy-draining scourge of design competitions. And there's also comic relief about actor Brad Pitt's attempts at healing New Orleans, dismissed by a local architect as design that resembles his best friend's mother's place in Malibu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shooting some 300 hours of urban footage and interviews with the help of director of photography, Luke Geissbühler, Hustwit lands some shimmering views of the epic city. He ignores lots that shapes cities, such as the Bilbao effect – named for Frank Gehry's 1990s design of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao that launched a global reinvention of cultural and academic institutions in cities that could afford it. But it's a pleasure to see the great Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer being interviewed, still lucid at 103: “I think architecture is invention. In architecture, it isn't enough to just have a building that functions. It can be beautiful. It can create surprise.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hustwit skips over the really bad architecture that does just the opposite, oppressing the human spirit in most cities around the world. Instead, Urbanized bounces often to happy instances of citizen engagement: the designers in Brighton, England, who sweetly chart the energy usage of residents on a little street, or the architects in Khayelitsha, South Africa, who design bold red buildings as safe havens for locals walking home late at night. Citizens can make a difference. But, sadly, their opinions matter not nearly as much as the real-estate developers and meddlesome politicians in, say, Toronto, where the bargain-basement vision of Mayor Rob Ford and his store-clerk minions is capable of undoing years of hard-fought citizen triumphs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, Urbanized soars when it allows people on the street and in their polished offices to speak simple truths about humanity and the urban condition. Ricky Burdett, director of LSE Cities, points out that, for better or worse, the 21st century is inextricably defined by cities: “By the 20th century, 20 per cent of the world's population was living in cities. Only two years ago, it was 50 per cent. If we continue at this pace, it'll be 75 per cent in 40 years time.” People are arriving in droves to city states with economic promise: Mexico City, Mumbai, Lagos and Sao Paulo. The Greater Toronto area can expect to absorb about one million newcomers within the next 30 years. That's daunting enough to imagine, but consider that many cities around the world are labouring under the weight of informal settlements containing hundreds of thousands of people. In fact, much of the important footage in Urbanized scans the flimsy makeshift shacks of the favelas in South America and India. “Thirty-three per cent of new urban dwellers today live in slums,” adds Burdett. “That's a third of the world's population without sewers, without water, without sanitation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In Mumbai,” says Sheela Patel, an advocate for that city's pavement dwellers and chair of Shack/Slum Dwellers International, “what you have in the city are real-estate developers and slum dwellers who are carving out the design of the city. The poor people are doing it because the plan has no space for them.” Meanwhile, the sad reality is that there are 600 people for every toilet seat. It makes the woes of Canadian cities seen trivial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a time highways looping like noodles around cities like Los Angeles, Montreal and Cairo were applauded as emblems of postwar progress. It seems unthinkable now but planners were paid to sever the workplace from housing. “We've been getting more and more of these massive developments by large home builders where every house is cookie-cutter and all of the big-box stores look exactly the same,” says Ellen Dunham-Jones, a professor of architecture at Georgia Tech. “More and more cars are required to drive much longer distances. This is now sprawl. This is not just suburbia.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we've come full circle, and what matters now is creating intimacy and exquisite detail within the city. “The eye can't command an area more than about 100 metres by 100 metres,” notes the erudite observer of public space Jan Gehl. That's why Amanda Burden, chair of New York's Planning Commission, obsessed along with activist citizens to create the High Line public park on a historic elevated rail line above Manhattan's West End. That's why she speaks about the magic of the movable chair as a tool to engage people, whether they be in the Jardin du Luxembourg in Paris or a newly pedestrianized section of NYC's Broadway Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Urbanized reminds politicians they must use fresh thinking. Subways, for example, may be only part of the solution for expanding public transit, especially as they're expensive and their construction can lag badly behind newly erupting city centres. The charismatic Enrique Penalosa, former mayor of Bogota, describes his approach: “The only way to restrict traffic jams is to restrict car use and the most obvious way to restrict car use is to restrict parking. … In our constitution, there's the right to housing, the right to education, the right to health – but I don't see the right to park. When I was elected mayor, we started investing in people. We started investing in sidewalks and schools and great parks and libraries. And … we started to create a bus-based public transport system called the TransMilenio. … For the same cost as a 25-kilometre subway, it's possible to build 400 kilometres of TransMilenio.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Urbanized makes city building a thrilling, if daunting project. It takes knowledge and guts, which is why seeing this doc is not only cool for urbanites, it's a necessary primer for any leaders who dare to call themselves urban.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Hustwit's Design Trilogy screens at TIFF Bell Lightbox Saturday through Tuesday (with the filmmaker introducing some screenings): Helvetica, Saturday, 12:30 p.m.; Objectified Saturday, 3 p.m.; Urbanized, Sunday, 8:30 p.m.; Tuesday, 6:30 p.m., 9 p.m.;</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the next federal election, perhaps in 2015, Bob Rae will have been gone from being the NDP premier of Ontario for two decades. By that time, a large swath of the Canadian voting public, especially those under 40, will remember nothing of those tumultuous times. Outside Ontario, chances are that voters would know nothing about those years, just as Ontarians wouldn't have clear opinions about Mike Harcourt's years as premier of B.C. or Don Getty's as premier of Alberta.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the Harper Conservatives will try to remind people of Mr. Rae's time as premier and paint it with the blackest of colours. That's how the Conservatives do politics: Tear down opposition leaders. The Conservative campaign against Mr. Rae has already begun. It will continue through the next election because, barring unexpected developments, Mr. Rae will lead the Liberals in that campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rae is the “interim” Liberal leader. In theory, the leadership race is supposed to start late next winter; in practice, it has begun with only one candidate, Mr. Rae. There is, frankly, no one else. If there were, Mr. Rae could leave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liberals can dream of Justin Trudeau, except he has ruled out a leadership bid. They can think of New Brunswick MP Dominic LeBlanc, who might be ready for prime time some years from now. They can ponder Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty. But the more they ponder, the more they'll realize that the last man standing will be Bob Rae.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twice, the Liberals passed over Mr. Rae – once for Stéphane Dion, once for Michael Ignatieff. Mr. Rae was the most experienced, the best speaker, the more natural politician – yet, he lost twice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, his time as NDP premier counted against him with some Liberals, either because they couldn't forget his lacerating attacks on their party before he switched sides, or because they feared those years would be used against him to telling effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were other, deeper reasons. Mr. Rae never gave the Liberals a clear enough narrative why he wanted to be leader and where he wanted to go. He offered the party himself and his talents, and they weren't enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When dealing with his time as NDP premier, Mr. Rae can't find the right narrative even now. Being a proud man, he defends those years, talking correctly about the difficulties of the recession Ontario faced, the challenges he overcame, the progress he made – although the generalized historical view is that of a buffeted and unsuccessful government. Ontarians apparently thought so. They decisively dumped the NDP at the first opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having poured his reflections into books and speeches, Mr. Rae left the NDP. Here's where the narrative failed. In appealing to Liberals for their votes, he never explained why he and the Liberal Party could achieve objectives (other than taking power) that the NDP couldn't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rae never told Canadians why liberalism trumped social democracy, or why the Liberals reflected better than the NDP what he came to believe in. Now, the party desperately needs that narrative to bring at least some of those former Liberals back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rae can seek the leadership again as a way of personal vindication: At his age, and with his innate love of politics, it's hard to imagine him preferring a law firm to leading the Liberal Party. Politics was injected into his blood early – first at university, then as a young NDP MP. It still courses in his veins. He's a man of many interests beyond family, but one trumps all: politics.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billy Ding wrote me a letter. He is by no means the first restaurateur to try to capture my attention, but this guy tugged at my heartstrings pretty efficiently. He wrote: “I was a flight professional in Hong Kong. My ramen noodle master for three years taught me to hand-make good quality of ramen without putting any chemical and preservatives into it. … I am still bearing in mind that my Japanese master told me that ‘if I came and visit you and find out that you use chemical and MSG, I will be absolutely disgrace.'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So every day Billy only makes a certain amount of ramen, just enough for that day, and when he sells out, he closes the door to Jyuban Ramen House, which is in a quite large strip mall in Markham. A very special strip mall in that it also houses about a dozen Chinese restaurants, from which emanate the most wonderful smells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am, as faithful readers of this column will recall, mad for ramen. I have rarely met a noodle I didn't love, and the combo of noodles with rich chicken or pork broth is enough to make my day. Especially in the winter. Could there be a better comfort food?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the problem with ramen is that most of it is so loaded with preservatives and MSG that we're getting a truckload of artificially jumped-up flavours. Which may be okay, depending on your feelings about chemicals in your food. Here's the thing: I prefer my food chemical-free. Billy's ramen is for sure purer than most of the other ramen in town. And the flavour buzz is … quieter. Which just serves to remind how addicted we've all become to chemically jacked-up tastes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billy makes three different kinds of ramen: For the pale-green spinach noodles, he grinds spinach into juice and mixes it into unbleached flour, which is then kneaded. Same deal for squid-ink pasta, and egg noodles get real eggs as opposed to the more common powdered eggs. The results are noodles with good strong flavour. Billy also eschews potassium sorbate, the noodle “strengthener” commonly used to give ramen both smoother texture and longer shelf life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jyuban's menu is small, as befits the maven of fresh-made daily noodles. The room is a standard ramen shop – unadorned, a variation on the fast-food theme. The pale green and cream walls and high ceiling are plain but soothing. It is a place of calm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But avoid the apps, which I find nasty. The menu says shrimps kinpura are “absolutely different texture from tempura.” The server calls them tempura when she delivers them, and they taste and feel like lousy tempura, both greasy and mushy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the ramen is impeccable. Number 9 super-bowl ramen refers not to a football game but to the plethora of stuff in the bowl. There are all three kinds of noodles – spinach, squid ink and egg, each with its own characteristic taste. There is barely cooked bok choy, sweet pickled egg with properly oozing yolk, corn, green onions, fresh scallops in the shell, New Zealand mussels, sweet-cooked pork and diverse unidentifiable cuts of beef that are also sweet and almost tender. The broth is lighter than the usual ramen broth, with vegetable undertones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The classic Japanese favourite ramen, tonkotsu, is pork-bone soup (pork bones simmered for many hours so that the stock catches all the flavour of meat and marrow and becomes milky) with egg noodles, corn, sweet pickled egg, boy choy, sweet pork and green onion, with crisp nori on top. The tonkotsu broth we're accustomed to is stronger than this, but it leaves me wondering: Have our taste buds become so addicted to chemical flavours and the artificial taste sensation of MSG that we don't like the real thing as much when we meet it? This is sort of like the problem I have with deep-fried food, which I know is not good for me. Offer me a choice between a shrimp tempura and a naked shrimp and I would rather eat the one in batter. I know it's not the right choice, but my palate has been trained to love crunch and grease, so I crave it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Same deal with Jyuban's chemical-free broths. They feel almost too light on the tongue, and yet I know they're intrinsically better than the chemical-ridden standards of the ramen world. Is one to re-train one's palate to appreciate (and one hopes, eventually prefer) more pure food? I can't instruct you on that. I can tell you that Jyuban Ramen is a good place to start.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The go-to word this week for people seeking to demonize their opponents is “radical.” It's a handy way of saying a person is going too far, in the wrong direction, in the speaker's opinion.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver flung the word at opponents of the proposed Northern Gateway pipeline, which would carry oil from Alberta to the British Columbia port of Kitimat. “Unfortunately, there are environmental and other radical groups that would seek to block this opportunity to diversify our trade,” he said in an open letter, referring to aboriginal leaders and others who fear the pipeline will result in calamitous oil spills on the B.C. coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Toronto, columnist Marcus Gee noted that some city councillors had lobbed the word at Mayor Rob Ford. He quoted Adam Vaughan: “What we have here is a radical conservative agenda to shrink our capacity to pay for things and as a result force us into making cuts.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radical is not the root of all evil, but it started with a root. The word derives from the Latin radix, root, also the source of radish. When radical entered English in the 1300s, it meant concerned with the essentials of life. Only in the 1600s did it acquire the sense of going to the root of things, as in the medical sense of radical surgery. The political sense of cutting a system back to its roots emerged in the late 1700s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radical is in the eye of the beholder – one person's reformer is another's revolutionary menace – and fashions change. Ambrose Bierce wrote in The Devil's Dictionary that radicalism is “the conservatism of tomorrow injected into the affairs of today.” Gilbert Seldes, in his 1961 compilation The Great Quotations, described a then-recent poll that asked people to comment on paragraphs from the U.S. Bill of Rights. “Several were so frightened by the ‘radical' ideas that they refused to go on record, and the majority of those who did declared them dangerous, un-American, even ‘red.'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radical (or rad) even enjoyed a stretch as a synonym for excellent and cool. California surfers used it in the 1960s, the San Fernando Valley picked it up in the 1970s and it entered general slang, flaring up in 1990 with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, for whom “radical” and “awesome” were mantras.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who see radical as a positive word are in the same camp as 19th-century religious leader Phillips Brooks (“In the best sense of the word, Jesus was a radical”), U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt (“I am in every fibre of my body a radical”) and president Woodrow Wilson, whose words a century ago have an ironic ring in the context of an oil pipeline: “I tell you the so-called radicalism of our times is simply the effort of nature to release the generous energies of our people.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who see radical as a dirty word are in bed with president Franklin D. Roosevelt (“A radical is a man with both feet firmly planted in the air”) and, um, gangster Al Capone, who said in 1929, “Don't get the idea that I'm one of these goddam radicals. Don't get the idea that I'm knocking the American system.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Joe Oliver grows too fond of bandying about the word “radical,” he might consider that it has been interpreted in ways that would not flatter the governing Conservatives or the cause of the pipeline. U.S. historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr., whose son of the same name advised John F. Kennedy, defined a radical as “a person who, in contrast to the conservative, favours a larger participation of the people in the control of government and society and in the benefits accruing from such control.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But let us end on a philosophical note, from 19th-century humorist Henry Wheeler Shaw, pen name Josh Billings. “If a man is right, he can't be too radical; if he is wrong, he can't be too conservative.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having now had time to analyze the impact that the federal government's take-it-or- leave-it funding offer will have on the delivery of health care, Canada's premiers gather this week in an attempt to forge a united response to Ottawa's plan.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will not be easy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the eve of the talks, conference host B.C. Premier Christy Clark is demanding changes to a federal proposal she says does not factor in the higher costs of health care for seniors. And while her demographically weighted solution to the problem will be music to the ears of some provinces, it is certain to be met with fierce resistance by jurisdictions such as Alberta that would pay a steep price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Ms. Clark's position certainly threatens any hope of the premiers emerging from their meetings with a consolidated position on the new funding formula, it is not the only area in which there is expected to be deep disagreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some provinces regard the payment scheme that Finance Minister Jim Flaherty presented the provinces in December as merely the starting point for negotiations on a new health-care funding model, others accept Ottawa's view that it is a non-negotiable offer and that the best that can be hoped for is some tweaking to address unintended problems of the nature Ms. Clark has outlined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The talks are certain to highlight just how radically health-care policy in Canada is about to change under the Conservative government. After decades of complaining about the strings that Ottawa has attached to health-care funding, the provinces will now be able to do what they want with that money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with that freedom comes more responsibility and the ever-increasing pressure that rising health-care costs are putting on budgets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To that end, the premiers are expected to talk about joint strategies they can undertake to help slow some of those cost drivers. Those discussions will centre around initiatives that individual provinces have taken to reduce expenditures (innovation success stories), new funding models that are helping to shrink outlays, and ways to improve quality in the system that are also leading to savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall and Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty intend to press for an innovation fund that would help underwrite initiatives that would produce efficiencies in the system, such as electronic health records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But before the first ministers get there, there will be more talk, some of it no doubt heated, about the funding model Mr. Flaherty unveiled to the premiers as a fait accompli.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current health accord with Ottawa expires in 2014. Mr. Flaherty presented the premiers with a plan in which annual increases from the federal government stay at the current 6 per cent until 2017 and thereafter are tied to inflation and economic growth until the pact expires in 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost immediately, the new deal that allocated funds on a per-capita basis rather than giving poorer provinces a disproportionate share of federal health dollars was hailed by growing and economically robust jurisdictions like Alberta, which will be the biggest winner under the revised formula. Provinces such as Quebec and Ontario, among others, were not as thrilled as they are likely to receive proportionately less money than they do now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Clark, who will chair the first ministers' meeting, concedes that there are varying views among the premiers about Ottawa's offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Some think of it as a starting point for negotiations, and others look at it and see it as a position that can be shaped and improved but not through a full-blown many-year-long negotiation,” Ms. Clark said in an interview. “Personally, I think we need to be focusing on a decision that we can shape.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On that note, the B.C. Premier is going to table a proposal that seems fair on the surface but is certain to engender resistance from some of her colleagues, mostly notably Alberta Premier Alison Redford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While B.C. is pleased the new funding model leaves all decision-making on how it will be spent up to the provinces, Ms. Clark says it does not recognize demographics, which are a huge cost driver in the health-care system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think the consequences of the new model, unintended as they are, are going to be severe for seniors all across the country,” Ms. Clark said. “The decision to go to straight per capita regardless of age represents a massive shift in health-care dollars away from senior citizens. We can't sustain a health-care system across the country under those circumstances.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As such, B.C. would like to see the funding weighted to take into account senior citizens leaving snowbound outposts in Alberta in retirement for milder locations in its province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada, people between the ages of 65 and 75 cost the health-care system nearly triple what those under 65 do. Seniors 75 and over, meantime, are twice as expensive as those between the ages of 65 and 75.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Straight per capita means you're giving a lot less money to provinces where seniors reside and a lot more to provinces where they don't,” Ms. Clark said. “So in B.C. where a lot of people move as they age we're going to see a growth in our allocation under the Canadian Health Transfer (CHT) of .05 per cent. In Alberta, they're going to see a growth in CHT of about 50 per cent.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials in the B.C. Ministry of Health have run numbers of what a new health funding formula might look like if it was weighted for demographics. Not surprisingly, B.C. (along with Quebec and New Brunswick, among others) would do much better, and provinces such as Ontario and Alberta would be worse off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is why Ms. Clark's proposal is likely to be one of many difficult discussions Canada's premiers are going to have at this meeting.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When officials announced this month that Toronto was posting an unexpectedly big budget surplus of $154-million for 2011, critics of Mayor Rob Ford let out a triumphant “aha.” Here, they crowed, was proof of what they had been saying all along. The city was not in such bad financial shape after all. Mr. Ford had manufactured a crisis to justify spending cuts that were simply not needed.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It proved nothing of the sort. The city often finds itself with sudden windfalls at year-end when tax revenues come in higher or spending lower than expected. Because Toronto is required by law to have a balanced budget, officials are careful to make conservative projections at the start of the year, giving themselves some leeway when the bills come due. The result is often a tidy, and tempting, year-end surplus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, the city has been using part of this money to cover expenses for the year to come. It is like relying on sofa-cushion money to pay the mortgage. It is not part of the household budget and you can't count on it. It means that the city is paying its bills with unsustainable, unpredictable revenue, leaving it to begin each annual budget struggle from behind the eight ball.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a sloppy, unwise practice and Mr. Ford is right to want to end it. City finance officials have been saying for years that Toronto should quit relying on windfall money to plug its annual budget gap. Using the temporary surpluses and dipping into reserves only masks the fact that, in truth, the city's spending chronically exceeds its permanent revenue. This “structural deficit” has dogged the city's books for years, making it hard to find the wherewithal to pay for critical needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, at long last, the city is moving to close that chasm. This year, instead of using its windfall to pay for current programs its income won't support, it plans to put aside the extra $154-million for future needs. A proposal from the city's executive committee, which will go to city council next week, would see the money go toward a fund for TTC capital projects like the purchase of new streetcars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief financial officer Cam Weldon said this week that by preserving rather than spending the windfall, the new budget approach “takes us a long way to fiscal sustainability.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, if predictably, the mayor's critics are not listening. No sooner did city officials announce their new surplus numbers than city council's left erupted in outrage at the mayor. How dare he try to cut services when he had all that extra cash to pay for them? Why would he put away money for a rainy day with $154-million in hand?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As if it isn't a rainy day when even wading pools are deemed unaffordable,” huffed the Toronto Star, referring to the unspeakably cruel decision to close five city wading pools that are underused and in need of repair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In truth, the Ford administration has shown itself quite willing to use new-found resources to save services that face the chop. Mr. Ford is backing a staff proposal to save threatened student-nutrition programs and community centres by dipping into an extra $8.8-million income from the property tax.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have long been fascinated with the way the world will end, whether it happens with a bang or, as T.S. Eliot thought more likely, a whimper. The Victorians could not get enough of lurid, boiling clouds that parted to reveal an angry finger pointing at the luckless damned down on Earth. A painter who knew how to handle turbulent red skies and the shrieking faces of unbelievers bound for their fiery reward was a painter who could fill his pockets from then till doomsday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such a painter was the Victorian polymath John Martin, whose apocalyptic paintings are currently the subject of a popular exhibit at London's Tate Britain gallery. However, they're not as popular as they were 150 years ago, when Martin's great triptych The Last Judgment embarked on an international tour, thrilling and horrifying audiences around the world for years. A frenzy greeted the paintings' arrival in each city: While lights flashed and dramatic music played, audiences gathered to marvel at Martin's cities tumbling into the abyss, sinners turning into sinner bacon, and Jesus presiding over it all with a smile just this side of smug. It was the theatre of Armageddon more than a century before Bruce Willis saved the world from certain doom in a film of that name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contemporary critics loathed Martin's overcooked, finely observed scenes of suffering (the damned might as well have had “aaaiiieee” coming out of their mouths) much in the same way that critics tend to loathe the apocalyptic blockbusters that erupt (or flood, or land like a plague of locusts) on our screens every summer. Yet those Hollywood visions of the apocalypse, like Martin's, are highly popular, with one difference: Martin lived in an age of Christian inevitability, and there was no Bruce Willis around to take Jesus and Satan aside and get them to work out their differences. Martin's paintings contain no happy endings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our fixation with apocalyptic myths hasn't abated in the least, judging by the overwhelming attention paid to the end-times cult that predicted the world would end last May because, as its billboards said, “the Bible guarantees it.” Alas, there was no money-back guarantee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And you might have heard, if you fell into the orbit of the wrong bore at a dinner party, that many residents of Looneytown think the world will end on Dec. 21 this year, thanks to various ancient calculations the Mayan civilization left behind. (I imagine the Maya in the afterlife, yelling down: “Thanks for massacring all of us and screwing with our math!”)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps this preoccupation is understandable: Fear, says the historian Joanna Bourke in a book of that title, “is the most pervasive emotion of modern society.” But we allow our attention to be captured by the cartoonish, improbable visions of our end, while pretty much ignoring the rather more frightening facts staring us in the face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How many people noticed that the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists this week moved its doomsday clock one minute closer to midnight (i.e., doom), so that now it sits at five minutes to? A couple of years ago they'd moved it back to six minutes, buoyed by the efforts of U.S. and Russian presidents Barack Obama and Dmitri Medvedev to make cuts in their nuclear arsenals. Unfortunately, they haven't seen much progress since then, and in fact have seen troubling signs of regression on the nuclear-weapon and global-warming fronts. Even more insidious (and irksome for a bunch of high-level scientists), they detected a growing trend in policymaking to ignore scientific evidence in favour of political expediency. “The world's in a pickle,” said one of the scientists involved in the decision, Princeton's Robert Socolow. “Many people want to live better than they do now on a planet of finite size.” He added that the group was effectively giving Earth a bond rating, “and it strikes us as more dangerous than two years ago.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But people don't want to hear that message, it seems. They'd rather go see a thriller where post-apocalyptic zombies do war with a ragtag army led by Oscar Wilde and Emily Dickinson. For a true horror movie, though, you can't beat Lucy Walker's excellent documentary Countdown to Zero, in which a procession of scientists and politicians inform us that we're bound for the incinerator unless we rid the world of nuclear weapons. I was too scared to get up for popcorn when Jimmy Carter came on screen, estimating that as president, he would have had 26 minutes to respond to a report of a Soviet nuclear strike – to decide the fate of the world, essentially. Nyet, said Mikhail Gorbachev, appearing next. That estimate was too generous, and in truth, the leaders had “only a few minutes.” (There have been false alarms in which the decision was imminent, most notably with Boris Yeltsin in 1995. Fortunately, Mr. Yeltsin was sober and didn't push the button.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Never mind Mayan soothsayers and biblical ranters – this is the real stuff of nightmares. And unlike God's wrath, there is actually something to be done about it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE QUESTION</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is organic produce more expensive than non-organic, when its growers don't have to pay for the purchase and application of costly pesticides? Tokey Ryan of Harrow, Ont., wants to know.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ANSWER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pesticides aren't really so costly, and controlling pests such as insects and weeds allows farmers to achieve much higher yields on their crops, writes Brian J. Lowry, chair of the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton. And higher yields mean lower prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Genetically modified crops,” he adds, “take this one step further and achieve higher yields by modifying the genes of the crop plants themselves.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In buying organic, he writes, people show that they are willing to pay more to avoid any possible side effects of these scientific advances. And, “since retailers know that people who buy organic are willing to pay more, prices are set at what the market will bear.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paula Johanson of Victoria, who operated an organic market garden north of Edmonton for 15 years, adds that a significant cost the organic farmer faces is weeding. While non-organic farmers add pesticides to cut down on the number of weeds, organic farmers spend a lot more of their time hoeing and weeding. “The increased labour costs lead to a higher price for organic produce,” she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE QUESTION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jackie Phillips of Toronto wonders when and where wallpaper was first used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ANSWER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collected Wisdom looked into this and discovered the answer in the book Panati's Extraordinary Origins of Everyday Things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wallpaper, it says, originated in France in the 15th century as a relatively inexpensive alternative to the costly tapestries that adorned the walls of the well-to-do. It came into its own after the rise of paper mills in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Because the Chinese had developed papermaking centuries earlier,” the book says, “it was long assumed that wallpaper was an Oriental invention, but its actual birthplace was France.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FURTHER NOTICE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, we looked at why we clink wine glasses at the dinner table and concluded that the custom began after we stopped drinking from a communal bowl. As we no longer shared a bowl, clinking glasses became a way of preserving contact with our fellow diners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harris D. Gulko of Winnipeg, however, offers a different theory: “While I was sitting with Allan Bronfman in his office in the Seagram Building in Montreal many years ago (drinking VO, his personal favourite), he told me why one clinks glasses. Without the clinking, we could enjoy our drink with only four of our senses – taste, smell, touch and sight. Clinking glasses adds the fifth – sound.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not a constitutional crisis yet, but Britain and Scotland are inching toward one. At stake is not just the future of a nation but the political careers of two powerful men.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alex Salmond began with the Modified Lévesque Opening. The Scottish separatist leader said he will produce a referendum ballot in late 2014, shortly before the next British election, that will contain two or three questions. The first will ask if “they'd like the Scottish government to enter into negotiations with the U.K. government” toward national sovereignty. The additional questions would offer some lesser form of semi-sovereignty, including “devo max” (an expansion of the current devolution, which gives Scotland its own Parliament and some legal autonomy).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Salmond has told me he's fully aware of the phrase “sovereignty-association,” and he appears to be well-studied in René Lévesque's use of deliberate ambiguity as a tactic for maximizing the Yes vote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, Prime Minister David Cameron fired back with the Dion Gambit. Scotland, he declared, will be granted the authority to hold a referendum, as long as Westminster's conditions are met. And there should be only one question, a strict Yes or No one in which a clear Yes majority will result in certain and immediate separation from Britain. Only this question, whose possibility is contained in the Scotland Act, would be constitutionally allowable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was a politically bold and sensible move, probably inspired by Mr. Cameron's readings of Stéphane Dion's Clarity Act: By turning the referendum into a brick-wall question of secession, London gave Scots a sense of clarity, and also rendered a Yes vote as dangerous and unlikely as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Cameron, possibly overplaying his hand, added another condition: The referendum must be held by the end of 2013. Otherwise, Westminster could organize its own referendum on Scotland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This allowed Mr. Salmond to respond with the Lucien Bouchard Defence. He will hold the referendum, he said, in 2014. Scotland has the right to hold one, he said – not to declare separation but to give its government a mandate to enter into negotiations with Westminster. Mr. Cameron is not quite in checkmate, but it will require a bold sacrifice. A London-organized secession referendum would be unprecedented. A sequence of court challenges and political gambits is more likely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beneath this political brinkmanship are some harsh realities. If Scotland became independent tomorrow, it would immediately become one of the European leaders in homicides, hard-drug abuse, obesity, cancer deaths and alcoholism, and would have rates of poverty and chronic disease far higher than any of its neighbours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, Scotland is a very expensive place to administer. The British Treasury spends $16,000 a year on every Scottish man, woman and child, $2,500 more than it spends on their English neighbours; if Scotland's share of tax revenue and expenditure are added up, an independent Scotland would wind up with a $23-billion annual deficit, or 13.4 per cent of GDP (or worse, if separation hurt that GDP).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Salmond says Scotland would gain control of the 81 per cent of North Sea oil in its territory, whose revenue could theoretically lower that deficit to a more manageable 6.8 per cent of GDP. But that doesn't leave room for surprises – such as the billions Britain spent bailing out Scotland's huge banks. And independence would make Scotland a single-resource nation that would be spending all its resource revenue within its own economy. This is not a recipe for prosperity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the morning after secession would not be an easy one for Mr. Salmond. It would mark the end of a spectacular two decades during which he has led Scotland boldly and often impressively. His political and fiscal fortunes would be hurt: He has no reason to desire any secession that would be soon or easy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His best tactic is to hold the referendum as close as possible to his re-election vote, and to make the question so vague that it will produce something he can call a Yes, however meaningless.

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash is a good place to start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The party is being dramatically outstripped on the fundraising front by Stephen Harper's Tories, who are on track to add $24-million to their war chest in 2012, according an analysis by the Liberal Party's outgoing president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is in addition to $80-million the Conservatives have raised since 2008, which is about 40 per cent more than the $32-million the Grits have been able to attract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report notes that the Liberal Party has about 40,000 donors, which is estimated to be about one-third of the number contributing to Tory coffers. And that gap is widening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Saturday, Don Tapscott, an outsider and total stranger to Liberals and their politics, will attempt to launch them on their adventure to find a way back to power. His message? Innovate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A visionary and renowned business thinker, Mr. Tapscott is the keynote speaker at the Liberals' three-day policy convention. His presence indicates what the Liberals are hoping to achieve this weekend: to get rid of vested interests, open up the party to outsiders and find policies to engage Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Tapscott, the question facing Liberals is whether they can bring about fundamental change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The leaders of the old have great difficulty embracing the new,” he says. “Your success in the old becomes your inertia. I suppose that is the big challenge facing the Liberal Party – that, more than any party, it's kind of like Canada's most successful ruling party if you look at history since Confederation. So more than any other party they are the leader of the old paradigm.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reduced to a 34-seat rump in last May's election, Liberals are trying to plot a recovery that doesn't involve falling back into familiar patterns, such as pointing fingers or the infighting that has defined the party since the John Turner years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Party officials say about 3,000 delegates, 1,000 of whom are under age 30, are attending the convention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing less than blowing up the leadership selection process and adopting a wide-open primary system – as well as other measures to make the party more transparent and wrest power from MPs and the leader – will be voted on this weekend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on Day 1, it was the party's ability to raise money that came under the microscope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Liberals are to be viable, outgoing president Alfred Apps says, they must replace the few hundred corporate and wealthy donors who used to finance the party with thousands of small donations from individuals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, at this convention, he and his executive team are pushing for changes to fundraising, including the creation of a $2.5-million call centre for soliciting donations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That facility would also help gather information about individuals, including what issues concern them. The Tories are also way ahead of the Liberals at identifying their voters and keeping them engaged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liberal pollster Michael Marzolini, head of the national polling firm Pollara, meanwhile, suggests something Liberals can do immediately to help fundraising efforts: Lose the superior attitude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For 20 years, the most frequently mentioned complaint by Canadians about Liberals is that they are arrogant and think they know better than the general public,” notes Mr. Marzolini.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is appropriate that Liberals listen to, and consider the views of, Canadians of every walk of life. The Liberals need to become the allies of Canadians – their brothers and sisters, rather than their parents.”</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one certainty is that staged fights are on the verge of their final curtain call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has become the chatter of the league lately, the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> moving decisively on what is perceived to be the simplest of all problems to fix. Two coaches send out their resident goons, they catch each other's eye, agree to “go,” drop their gloves and whale away on each other until they tire and, in what has become ritual, the linesmen move in and the two fighters, if still on their skates, skate away looking up at the scoreboard to see if their moment in the spotlight is already on replay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there may be fans who still believe such a fight can change the course of the game, the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> thinking has long been that the staged fight accomplishes nothing, apart from possible entertainment, and that possible entertainment dividend has recently been cancelled out by miserable PR for the league's failure to move, in any capacity, on fighting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So you get rid of something extraneous, unnecessary and – to many in the league – embarrassing for the game, and the soft, pinko, crybaby critics who think hockey should be booboo-free can no longer accuse the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> of living in the Dark Ages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Change is already evident to anyone who has paid attention to how most teams are structured these days. The fourth line, hockey's vestigial appendage, has slowly transformed from the threesome where you store the thug(s) to one that, if you really must use a fourth line, you can send out speed and high energy for the handful of minutes a fourth line consumes. They may not be the greatest players, but they can play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The formal end to staged fights may well begin during the general managers' scheduled meetings March 12-14 in Boca Raton, Fla. The following day would be the Ides of March, appropriately signalling to those who perform in the staged farces that the end is nigh. By next season, there may be serious penalties for players and teams that stage fights. None may be necessary, however, as by then there will not likely be enough such players in the league who know the required dance moves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fighting of any kind is already declining in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>. As reported this week, the number of fights has fallen by 25 per cent. That still means there will be approximately one fight for every two of the 1,230 games played during the regular season – an astonishingly high figure compared to such other high-contact sports as professional football – but there remains indisputable evidence that both fights and fighters are declining in number.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some are decrying the shift. Toronto Maple Leafs GM Brian Burke spoke out loudly in defence of enforcers this past week when he said he was forced to send Colton Orr to the minors because Orr could find no one to fight with. With only one major this year, Orr's remuneration amounted to $1-million a round.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burke's point, embraced by many, is that with the enforcer role now falling to league disciplinarian Brendan Shanahan and on-ice issues no longer settled by fists but by possible suspension, “the rats will take this game over.” Others argue that Shanahan's hard-line stand is precisely what will reduce the elbows and stick work and head shots, and they point to renowned “rat” Matt Cooke of the Pittsburgh Penguins, who last year had 129 minutes in penalties, was suspended for the final 10 games of the season and the first playoff round, promised to reform and has. Cooke has only 14 minutes in penalties this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may be as well that the diminishing role of fighting is merely a statistical anomaly, but we think it is real and merely the beginning of real change. The end of staged fights is such a simple gesture that the league will move against it without much debate. Huge debate, on the other hand, would follow any motion toward an outright ban on fighting, the tossing of fighters from games (as other team sports do), or the common-sense argument that a five-minute major for even spontaneous fights is no penalty whatsoever and the penalty must, in a team sport, carry real consequences for it to mean anything at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, a lot of fighters are soon to receive pink slips from a game they were never expected to play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While history suggests they will, in return, instantly receive employment offers from sports television panels to explain that game they never played.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the big curiosities about the Republican presidential race has been the seeming absence of the Tea Party movement as a force wielding anywhere near the influence it did during the 2010 midterm elections that swept scores of Democrats out of Congress.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, is there no greater reflection of the Tea Party's reduced clout than the victories of Mitt Romney in Iowa and New Hampshire? The so-called “Massachusetts moderate” has seemed unstoppable against the self-proclaimed true conservatives in the race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, Mr. Romney's success so far may say less about the revenge of the moderates than it does about his own rebranding as a Tea Party candidate, deftly appropriating the language of the movement. As such, he is doing what it takes to win a GOP nomination in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Romney's father and then Michigan governor George Romney ran for the GOP nomination in 1968, he touted his record promoting civil rights, introducing a state income tax and courting organized labour. Today, he would be laughed out of the room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The son has not dared defy the writing on the wall. Indeed, he has even supplied the pen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The common wisdom right now is that the Tea Party has not succeeded because it's Romney who's winning,” says Harvard University sociologist and Tea Party expert Theda Skocpol. “I really disagree with that. … Tea Partiers have slowly come around to accepting Romney because he has endorsed everything they are advocating.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Mr. Romney cleaned up among Tea Party sympathizers in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, winning 41 per cent of their vote, according to exit polls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, Mr. Romney has also benefited from a divided opposition. Scores of Tea Party groups have splintered because of their inability to unite behind one candidate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Romney is outperforming his rivals among the very voters thought to be most hostile to him because he speaks to their concerns better than the other candidates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tea Partiers rail against big government. But they cling to their own benefits – mainly Social Security and Medicare – arguing they have already paid for them with their taxes. What gets their goat are purely redistributive programs aimed at those who pay few or no taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As she waited for Mr. Romney to show up at a rally this week, Deia Nourse offered her rebuttal against accusations that the former buyout mogul once practised “vulture” capitalism, callously gutting struggling companies to pad his own bulging wallet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The other side of the coin is that people who work really hard are having their money going to people who don't work at all,” the 59-year-old New Hampshirite asserted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consciously or not, Ms. Nourse was articulating a major gripe of Tea Party sympathizers. Mr. Romney, perhaps more than any other candidate, has understood the nature of their grievances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has defended Social Security against Republicans who seek to privatize it, while tapping into the very veins of indignation toward President Barack Obama that sparked the Tea Party's birth, such as his plan to subsidize the purchase of health insurance by the poor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He wants to turn America into a European-style entitlement society,” Mr. Romney said on Tuesday, employing a term that, in Tea Partier eyes, implies unearned benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prof. Skocpol, co-author of The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism, also detects Tea Party influence in Mr. Romney's hard-line stand on illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas Governor Rick Perry, an early Tea Party favourite, lost the movement's support by defending his state's policy of subsidizing college tuition for young people brought to the United States illegally as children. Mr. Romney quickly moved to oppose any leniency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent attacks against Mr. Romney's past, running buyout firm <span class="companylink">Bain Capital</span>, are aimed at white working-class voters. They have become the core of Republican support since so-called Reagan Democrats began switching sides in the 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Perry and ex-House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, who face elimination in the Jan. 21 South Carolina primary, are appealing to working-class Republicans by portraying Mr. Romney as a greedy millionaire acting against their interests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They see South Carolina as a place where an economic populist message might have some chance,” Prof. Skocpol offers. “It's a very conservative state with a lot of fairly downscale people who vote Republican.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, such arguments are typically a hard sell with Republicans, rich or not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Pew Research Center survey released Thursday found that class has supplanted race as the biggest source of perceived conflict in American society. But Republicans are far more likely than Americans as a whole – 58 per cent to 43 per cent – to believe that the rich earned their wealth through “their own hard work, ambition or education.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if the Gingrich-Perry attacks prove effective among some GOP voters, Mr. Romney may have come up with a rebuttal that works better with Tea Partiers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This country already has a leader who divides us with the bitter politics of envy,” he said Tuesday in repudiating his GOP rivals. “I stand ready to lead us down a different path, where we are lifted up by our desire to succeed, not dragged down by a resentment of success.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Carolina will be Mr. Romney's biggest test yet. If he passes it, the Massachusetts moderate will have taken a step closer to becoming the first Tea Party president.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, the most important news is not on the front page. Such is the case with the disturbing story about resveratrol that I found buried deep inside Thursday's Globe Life section. Resveratrol is the magic ingredient that makes red wine so healthful. It protects your neurons from decay and your heart from bad cholesterol, and is even credited with lengthening your life. “Those misguided teetotallers,” I often mutter as I pour myself another glass.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, it turns out that a leading resveratrol researcher has been accused of faking his research. The university that employs him has laid out its case in a 60,000-page report. There goes the wine drinker's favourite alibi. There goes the one thing I actually enjoyed doing to improve my health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improvement of one's health has become the chief imperative of modern life. Anyone who fails to monitor and regulate her LDL, her HDL, her blood pressure, her lipids, her bone density and her BMI is judged to be shockingly negligent (and no doubt a future burden to the system). If any of these vital indicators are too high or too low, a responsible person will take steps to fix it. If the price of freedom is eternal vigilance, then eternal vigilance is also the price of health. Each day brings fresh advice from experts to increase my flavonoids, decrease my sodium, detox my dinner party, ingest more whole grains, antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids, tone my triceps and exercise about a hundred times more than I want to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is discouraging,” I told my girlfriend the other day. We were on the stationary bikes in the gym, going up and down imaginary hills. After 20 minutes of awfully hard work, I had burned up 138 calories, according to the computer. It also reported my distance, my RPMs, my heart rate and my wattage. (I can pedal hard enough to power a none-too-bright light bulb.) After we were done, we restored ourselves with cappuccinos and chocolate-covered biscotti.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone says exercise is good for you, but I'm not so sure. My grandma's idea of exercise was a stately walk around the block with her dachshunds as she urged them to do their duty. Today, someone my grandma's age (me) is expected to run marathons and climb Mount Kilimanjaro, or at the very least go in for Bikram yoga. But I know these things can backfire. A friend ran marathons until her toenails turned black and fell off. Another friend got altitude sickness, whose symptoms are too unpleasant to describe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even yoga can be dangerous. In last Sunday's <span class="companylink">New York Times Magazine</span>, an incredibly detailed article described how even the fittest people can wreck their bodies doing yoga. The road to inner harmony is paved with slipped discs, degenerated hip sockets, torn Achilles tendons, even strokes. One master practitioner was quoted as saying that “the vast majority of people” should give up yoga altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As someone who never managed to progress beyond the Downward Dog, I found this news incredibly heartening. For years, I've felt vaguely guilty about not doing yoga. But now I realize I may have saved my life! No doubt other things that are bad for your health will turn out to be good things, and vice versa. Today's health wisdom has a way of becoming tomorrow's bunk. It's even possible that everything we think we know about fat is wrong, too. That's the view of science writer Gary Taubes. He argues that obesity is not the result of eating too much food and sitting around too much. Instead, it's ultimately the result of a hormonal imbalance caused by ingesting way too many carbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This may help explain why all the standard diet and exercise advice is worthless. Eating less doesn't work, because whatever weight you lose will almost invariably come back, and then some. Exercise doesn't work, either, because it hardly burns up any calories, and you just work up an appetite. Yet, as Mr. Taubes says in Why We Get Fat, “faith in the health benefit of physical activity is now so deeply ingrained in our consciousness that it's often considered the one fact in the controversial science of health and lifestyle that must never be questioned.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Countless research studies prove that, for most of us, exercise and diet don't result in long-term weight loss. And yet the public-health nannies continue to dispense their completely useless advice, then blame us when it doesn't work. Obviously, it's our fault for not trying hard enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So is the obesity epidemic irreversible? Are you and I doomed to live with our expanding middles? Maybe not. Mr. Taubes counsels the Atkins approach. Stop counting calories. Eat lots of fat, meat, protein and leafy greens. Cut out the white flour, sugar, soda and starchy veg, and exercise strictly for fun. This approach appeals to me because I like meat and hate counting calories. Also you're allowed to drink red wine, an essential part of any diet even if resveratrol is a crock. Especially when consumed on a comfy couch with someone nice. The road to inner harmony and health is different for us all. And that's mine.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government has asserted its role in health care. There is to be no big vision about saving medicare, and no strings are to be attached to future funding. Now, it appears, there may be no health accord, either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finance Minister Jim Flaherty's take-it-or-leave it offer, which runs for a decade, is entirely reasonable and transparent. As for setting policy and holding the provinces to account, the federal government seems disinclined; the administration and delivery of health care are a provincial responsibility.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This approach is very different from Paul Martin's $41-billion “fix for a generation,” which expires in 2014. His health accord came with large ambitions and larger hopes of buying change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though laudable, the accord's record is mixed. There have been improvements on wait times in five areas, including joint replacements and diagnostic tests such as CT scans, but no national pharmaceutical strategy. A significant amount of accord money went toward income increases for the highly paid – doctors, nurses and hospital administrators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Stephen Harper said recently in a radio interview that provinces are “going to have to look seriously at what needs to be done to make the system more cost-effective.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talks between federal and provincial officials begin in Victoria on Monday. The provinces are already signalling their concern that there is no mechanism to ensure national standards or service</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">improvements. It frets that Ottawa is distancing itself from one of Canada's most cherished programs. The reality is that the federal government – save for the accord – hasn't taken a strong leadership role in health policy for decades, despite the supersized Health Canada bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The provinces don't need federal guidance to fix health care, and the outlines of Mr. Martin's accord remain. Wait times should continue to be reduced and home care expanded; pharmacare for the 21st century needs to be created. Common accountability measures can be created, with an oversight role for the Health Council of Canada. The Council of the Federation could be used as a secretariat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The provinces should see this change not as a crisis but as a historic test through which they must pass.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're planning a multigenerational family getaway to Spain. What's a great home base to explore from?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it's your first visit, Evelyne Drouin, a Spanish travel specialist with AMA Travel in Calgary (evelyne.drouin@ama.ab.ca), suggests starting in Barcelona. There's so much for the whole family to do here from exploring L'Aquarium Barcelona to marvelling at Gaudi's Sagrada Familia cathedral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, as hard as it is, corral everyone into a rental car and kiss the city goodbye for your holiday's main home base: the northern Costa Brava – the “dramatic coast” – known for its sea-swept views and ancient ruins. Drouin, who visits the country on an almost-annual basis, specifically recommends stopping in Aiguablava near the town of Begur. Here your kin can unpack into the Parador de Aiguablava (paradoresofspain.com), one of the government-run historic properties-turned-hotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Aiguablava, she says there are plenty of day trips to keep family members happy: wandering the art galleries of Cadaques, visiting the birthplace of Salvador Dali and exploring the bird sanctuary of Aiguamolls Nature Reserve. Or just enjoy the Mediterranean views and quality time with each other from this mountain perch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Robert Zuzek, president of Kompas Express (KompasExpress.com), a Toronto-based tour operator, suggests basing your clan in the vibrant metropolis of Madrid, or one of its nearby picturesque towns such as Segovia or Alcala de Henares, the birthplace of Cervantes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cities and their surrounding areas offer so much for all ages, says Zuzek, who has been sending travellers to Spain for almost four decades for the museums, restaurants, concerts, nightlife. One of his highlights? Touring the Museo Nacional del Prado in Madrid with a guide who tailored the experience to his five-year-old twins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end your task may be narrowing down where you want to go this time. As Drouin says, there's an old Spanish proverb: More things grow in the garden then the gardener sows. “It is an appropriate saying for travellers to Spain who invariably find more than first expected.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government has signalled its intention to reduce its role in shaping medicare to writing cheques. This would complete a 35-year journey that began in 1977, when Ottawa first capped its financial contributions to the provinces. At its peak, Ottawa's share of publicly financed health-care spending reached 41 per cent. Today, its cash contribution is just over 20 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The provinces run health care and have traditionally welcomed federal cash transfers with few strings attached. So what's wrong with Ottawa's self-imposed exile – is it not merely recognition that it has no legitimate role in shaping how the system develops?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not in our view. Writing cheques and walking away from the duty to improve medicare is not only a retrograde step that endangers health care and the economy, it also reveals a vision of an increasingly shrivelled and parochial federation, where governments look inward and the whole becomes a pastiche of increasingly isolated parts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are seven reasons why a strong federal presence in health care is vital to Canada:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Successful nations are built on unifying infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think railways and the Trans-Canada Highway, seamless telecommunications networks, the armed forces, regulatory and judicial processes. Health care is a level up in importance because health is a fundamental precondition for full participation in society.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A high-performing nationwide public system contributes enormously to the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses don't have to design and fund complex health plans for their employees. Workers don't have to worry that taking a job in another province will compromise their health care. Only leadership from Ottawa can guarantee a common set of programs and standards and ensure that program enhancements are available to all Canadians. The 2004 health-care accord acknowledged that Canada's public coverage of prescription drugs is not up to international standards. Ottawa must insist on improvement and put its money behind it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The intelligent use of health information is the key to better access, quality and efficiency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysis and comparison are the midwives of improvement. Canada' health-intelligence network is unco-ordinated, sluggish, incomplete and fragmented, a clumsy hybrid of paper and electronic records from which anything useful emerges slowly and at great cost. Both leadership and investment from Ottawa on an unprecedented scale are essential to creating high-quality, standardized information that improves clinical practice, policy and accountability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Provinces can't transform their systems on their own regardless of how much money they spend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The politics of health care are simply too fraught, and the vested interests too powerful, to effect large-scale change. Even worse, the jurisdictions routinely engage in unconstructive bidding wars for personnel and are whipsawed by vendors, such as pharmaceutical companies, that exploit their isolation and vulnerabilities. Ottawa should play a major role in creating a more collegial and co-operative federation that overcomes obstacles to reform and bargains more effectively in the public interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa could do a great deal to reduce the redundancy and bureaucracy in the system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A great example to emulate is the common process for reviewing the cost-effectiveness of drugs that both eliminated duplicate efforts and the confusion caused by multiple reports. Similarly, the whole area of professional credentials and regulation could be greatly simplified and standardized, with Ottawa promoting and brokering change. Something is wrong when it's more difficult for some professionals to get licensed in another province than it is for a Polish nurse to get a job in Liverpool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians deserve to know more about where the system succeeds and where it fails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Ottawa is not held as politically accountable for health care as the provinces, it's the ideal mirror to and conscience of the overall system. It shouldn't only invest in and co-design the health-information infrastructure but also mine that asset to report on how well the system performs, and promote a culture of openness and transparency where independent researchers and health-care providers can do the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa must proudly stand up for single-payer, not-for-profit health care and ensure that its financial contributions reinforce this commitment across Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several provinces have turned a blind eye to blatant violations of the Canada Health Act, and Ottawa has stood by. The country needs to know where its government stands on the basic character and values of medicare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Ottawa abdicates, health care will be increasingly fragmented and costly, and two-tier medicine will grow not because the public wants it but because Ottawa allows and perhaps encourages it.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first quarter of Sunday's National Football Conference division final in Green Bay, Packers receiver Jermichael Finley extends for a pass. <span class="companylink">New York Giants</span> defensive back Kenny Phillips comes across Finley's head with a forearm – a clear foul under the new NFL rules. Yet no flag falls. In the TV booth, FOX announcers Joe Buck and Troy Aikman watch the super slo-mo replay showing Finley's whiplash from the blow. “That should have been a flag on a defenceless receiver,” says Aikman.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past (before NFL referees looked like guilty guys inside a peep-show hood) there was margin for error when athletes collided at high speed with malice aforethought. TV announcers could bloviate about “physical” play and a “man's game” without fear of contradiction. There was a generous margin for error. In short, it was a world made for Don Cherry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As this weekend's NFL playoff games and NHL contests reveal, there is no hiding from the truth about dirty play in super slo-mo. A normal-motion picture is filmed at 24 frames per second. Television uses 29.97 frames/second. High-speed cameras can film up to a quarter of a million frames per second. If you're looking for one factor that has revolutionized pro sports coverage it's the unvarnished truth delivered by the sophisticated high-speed cameras recording sports events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With super slo-mo, we are able to distinguish that vicious James Harrison tackle as a head shot, not a high hit in blindingly fast real time. We can accurately capture Brad Marchand's submarine hit on Sami Salo for the weasel move it was. We can see just how dangerous it is when René Bourque pitches Brent Seabrook headfirst into the boards. If anything, the crystal-clear images amplify the idiocy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every one of these fouls is then relentlessly repeated and denounced as the medical staff tries to reconstruct the fallen victim on the field or the ice. In fact, the frame-by-frame study may be hurting pro sports, exposing just how dangerous they are to the human brain or the back or anterior cruciate ligament. When the running back's leg snaps like a turkey wishbone at 1/60th real speed or the defenceman's neck whiplashes like in a high-speed car crash, there is little room for debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, this unequivocal video evidence has crept into the mindset of the athlete. Faced with becoming the sports equivalent of the Zapruder film, we hear them now moaning about not knowing what constitutes a legal check or a proper tackle. We hear them saying they can't rewire training from the previous 20 years. They now say they're holding back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, super slo-mo has reduced televised sports to a Supreme Court appeal with briefs for the defendant (“He got him in the shoulder, not the head!”) and depositions for the complainant (“He targeted the head!”). TV crews of former players are now deliberative bodies engaged in extemporaneous debate. What can't be debated is the impact the technology has had on the alibi pro sports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stock answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They say the truth shall set you free. Super slo-mo has produced the truth is pro sports. It's uncertain whether that has set anyone free of the sports' shibboleths While its cameras pick up the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, Hockey Night In Canada's on-air oracles still try to fog up the lens with hot air. This Saturday it was the Sultan of Circumlocution, P.J. Stock, trying to explain the value of newly acquired Montreal Canadien René Bourque.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He has that nastiness that the Montreal Canadiens are missing. He has suspensions … I use the term stupid because a lot of suspensions are … every now and then you have to do something stupid to create some space for yourself for other players to be a little hesitant when they come around you. … I don't encourage it, but you have to do it every now and then.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To sum up, suspension-worthy acts are not to be encouraged. Unless, of course, propelling an opponent into the boards or elbowing him in the temple serves to get you some more space and time on the ice. Then it's okay. Now and then.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My child can't handle losing. I've noticed that when she's playing games with others, if she doesn't win the game, she gets all sulky and moody. How can I teach her that losing is part of life?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Losing is indeed part of life and for that reason a child should learn that lesson early – ideally by the time she starts school. It has been found that sore losers have more trouble than other children, as they get older, when it comes to making and sustaining friendships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some children are born with a temperament or personality where they need to always be in charge, which may mean winning. Toddlers are normally self-centered and at this age it may in fact be normal to insist on always getting one's way. However, as the child gets older, it becomes less appropriate to insist on being the winner 100 per cent of the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An innate temperament that is easily frustrated can be managed over time in such a way that the child learns to lose graciously. It takes much patience and begins with the parent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The way parents handle their own frustrations serve as a role model. Overly involved parents can make matters worse; setting unrealistic expectations for your child may contribute to the problem and focusing more on the outcome than the effort may also add fuel to the fire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Start by acknowledging her feelings. It is fine to get frustrated, but at the same time, losing does not mean that she is an inferior person. Praise her for her effort. Point out that she is constantly improving and that even the best athletes have off days. Use sport events on TV as a tool where she can see that even first ranked teams or players do not always win.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, we live in a culture where winning and being highly competitive have become the norm. Some coaches are guilty of focusing on winning more than effort or simple participation. Competition is good, but when winning becomes a superior way of saying, “We are better than those other bunch of losers,” then it may frustrate a child when she loses.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the rise in childhood obesity, school boards have introduced policies to encourage healthier eating. Schools should lead the way, yet they should take a reasonable approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pop, chips and chocolate are taboo, but schools have also been asked to rethink traditional bake sales. Even popular pizza days are being subjected to new rules.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strong focus on healthier children is to be encouraged. The number of obese youth has nearly tripled in the past three decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many of the new nutrition guidelines produced by provinces and school boards give educators little credit for being informed or having common sense. They feature detailed diagrams explaining how to read nutrition labels on packaging, and they outline what is already in the Canada Food Guide. They itemize foods that schools can no longer sell or should sell less often. Manitoba's 63-page nutrition handbook – the result of an all-party task force – suggests public schools consider alternatives to bake sales, such as selling compost bags, fruit or home-made crafts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under Ontario's new food policy, school boards must ensure that all food sold at schools, including at bake sales, meets healthy standards. It allows an exemption for up to 10 “special event days.” In British Columbia, an 86-page nutrition report bans the sale of everything from dried noodle soups to popsicles. It suggests tofu desserts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many schools have been mandated to alter their weekly pizza day, a staple fundraiser and treat. They must order lower-fat whole-wheat crust pizza. Even milk programs are being debated. Last week, after some deliberation, Calgary's public school board allowed chocolate milk into school cafeterias, but only after its nutritionist found a low-sugar variety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pressure is such that some teachers have begun encouraging only healthy snacks at class parties (carrots are okay, but no cupcakes on Valentine's Day).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone wants children to be healthy – good nutrition fosters better learning and fit children – but let us not go overboard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In countries such as Italy, children sit down to a hot, healthy (sometimes organic) hour-long lunch. In Canada, there is no funding for this. Hence there are packed lunches, cafeterias and pizza day. Nutritional guidelines are important, but so is trust in parents and educators.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Question</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My husband, who has been diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state, has been on a ventilator for eight months. Doctors say there is no hope. He can still communicate; he nods yes when I ask if he's in pain or distress. We never talked about what to do in such a situation. Years ago, when our dog became old and blind, I talked about putting him down. My husband did not wish that and said: “Will you do that to me if I lose my functions?” I am torn. How do I decide whether to remove him from life support?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a very tragic circumstance. Before making a decision, you need more medical certainty. If your husband is in a persistent vegetative state, he would not be able to communicate. You need to determine how much of your husband is truly in that hospital bed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Arthur Schafer, professor and director of the Centre for Professional and Applied Ethics at the University of Manitoba, you are in a difficult emotional struggle because you have been put in the position of having to decide for him, rather than represent his wishes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think most Canadians probably don't know what their spouse or their parent or their loved one would want in a circumstance like this, when they are not capable of communicating any longer,” Prof. Schafer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compounding matters is a prognosis that is not clear in your mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You want to establish consensus and certainty with the medical team about what his level of awareness is and what his prognosis is,” said Stephen Workman, an internist at the QEII Health Sciences Centre in Halifax who has an interest in end-of-life care. “She needs to know those two things.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Workman said you should ask the doctors what the chances are of your husband waking up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You may also want to ask your physician about a sleeping pill called zolpidem. It has had a paradoxical effect of waking some vegetative and minimally conscious patients for short periods. In a few, it has made a profound difference, while in others it has had no effect. Ask your doctor if it's worth trying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once you have that answered, you will have to determine whether your husband would want all these medical interventions he is receiving, including the ventilator, even if there is a chance he could wake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If she knows with certainty that her husband would not want to go on like this, she needs to find people to help her speak for him and accept what he wants and come to terms with his death,” Dr. Workman said. “Your heart and your mind have to be in the same spot to go ahead with this.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before making any final decision, you may want to speak to family, friends, a social worker or chaplain. You may even want to talk to a lawyer with expertise in end-of-life cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do not feel you need to rush this process. Ideally, you want to see this as something you are doing for your husband, not to him. With such a fraught decision before you, getting professional counsel is crucial.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa's rebuilding plans are proceeding faster than expected thanks to its young stars, resurgent veterans, rookie coach</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the announcement of the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> all-star game rosters last week, Ottawa drew a lot of attention, mostly for the ballot-box stuffing by its fans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there is an argument to be made for the presence of four Ottawa Senators (Jason Spezza, Daniel Alfredsson, Milan Michalek and Erik Karlsson) among the six players voted into the game by the fans, there is no question the Senators as a whole are one of the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s most pleasant surprises this season. Quick development by several youngsters on the team, combined with veteran leadership and scoring from Spezza, Alfredsson and Michalek, plus the excellent work of rookie head coach Paul MacLean, have the Senators solidly in playoff position, something few pundits saw coming in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Count Senators general manager Bryan Murray among the surprised. This was supposed to be a rebuilding year, as the Senators retooled from a roster stocked with homegrown veterans who fell short to a crop of talented but green youngsters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I can't say I saw exactly where we would be in the [Eastern Conference] right now,” Murray said. “But neither did I think we'd be 15th in the East.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The standouts among the kids are Karlsson, 21, whose offensive explosion from the blue line allowed Murray to trade blue-chip defence prospect David Rundblad for Kyle Turris, a top prospect at centre, and forward Colin Greening, 25, who was picked for the Young Stars game at the league all-star game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot of the kids played together on the Senators' American Hockey League team in Binghamton, N.Y. They were given some seasoning on the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> team last season and then went back to Binghamton and won the AHL championship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That's where we got the feeling we could make some changes on the big roster, because of the way the kids played,” Murray said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest help is the resurgence of Spezza, Michalek and Alfredsson. Spezza is back among the league's scoring leaders after two off-years, Alfredsson is back in form after injury troubles and Michalek is finally paying dividends almost three years after he arrived in the Dany Heatley trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spezza thinks a lot of credit should go to the players as a whole for quickly finding a way to work together despite the numerous changes to the roster last summer. “We have great chemistry in the room and we have performed well because of it,” he told The Ottawa Citizen. “There are a lot of unselfish players, guys playing different roles on different nights. Everybody has stepped up, and that's why we're in a playoff spot. We've had contributions from everyone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You can look back at big goals in big games by different guys. There have been some unlikely heroes along the way, and that has a lot to do with chemistry.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improvement brought one unexpected side effect for Murray. In the next few weeks, as the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> trade deadline approaches, the Senators will be among those teams expected to make some moves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Murray admits his approach to the trade deadline changed. He said he wants “to give our players a chance to do well in the playoffs” but not at the cost of sacrificing any of the organization's young talent. He expects another five or so youngsters in the system to make the team next season, headed by centre Mika Zibanejad of Sweden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're certainly not going to sacrifice [prospects] to bring in a veteran player,” Murray said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">***********</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A GM TO WATCH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot of people are keeping an eye on Tampa Bay Lightning general manager Steve Yzerman. He has some work to do with his underachieving team in the weeks leading up to the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s Feb. 25 trade deadline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Yzerman would like to add a top-four defenceman, that is the hardest thing to get in a trade. His greatest need is a goaltender, which is a little easier but still difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ideally, the Bolts would like to get a young goalie who will stick around, such as Cory Schneider of the Vancouver Canucks or Jonathan Bernier of the Los Angeles Kings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one to keep an eye on here is Bernier. The Kings' offence still needs improvement and since the highly-regarded Bernier is Jonathan Quick's backup he could be used to get a scorer and more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">********</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIVE GAMES TO WATCH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jets at Senators</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winnipeg needs to start showing its fans it can win on the road. If the Jets can knock off the formidable Senators, this will be a step in the right direction. Monday, 7:30 p.m., TSN-Jets, Sportsnet East, TVA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stars at Blues</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dallas has been all over the Western Conference standing this season and is now trying to stay in the hunt for a playoff spot. The Blues rose from the dead after Ken Hitchcock was hired as head coach. If the Stars are in the mood, this should be a dandy. Monday, 7:30 p.m., TSN 2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senators at Leafs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Leafs dropped two in a row after their four-game win streak and now face a big divisional game with the red-hot Senators. Tuesday, 7 p.m., Sportsnet Ontario, Sportsnet East, TVA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rangers at Bruins</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I bet NBC wishes it could trade its pick for this week's game for this one. This could be a preview of the Eastern Conference final and well worth heading for a sports bar to see. Saturday, 1 p.m., <span class="companylink">NHL</span> Network (U.S.), NESN, MSG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadiens at Leafs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter what the fortunes of the teams are, games between these historic rivals are always an occasion and generally entertaining. Saturday, 7 p.m., CBC, RDS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All times Eastern</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">******</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TEAMS TO WATCH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A WILD RIDE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When last we looked in on the Minnesota Wild, they were riding high at the top of the Western Conference. Now, because of an offence that is without punch even by the Wild's historical modest standard, a hopeless power play and wobbles in the team's normally sound defensive game, the Wild are struggling to stay in the top eight in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the Jets, the Wild just can't win on the road. They are in the midst of a four-game trip that ends Thursday in Toronto versus the Maple Leafs and rookie head coach Mike Yeo said this stretch could decide if the Wild are a playoff team or not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We've got some tough games coming up. If we hope [for] what we want to happen, it's not going to happen,” Yeo told the Pioneer Press newspaper in St. Paul, Minn. “It's time we decide, ‘Do we want to make this happen?' and start doing it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the problems is the normally reliable goaltender Niklas Backstrom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before he came down with an illness at the end of last week, Backstrom was 1-5 in his previous six starts with a save percentage of .890 and a 3.54 goals-against average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scorer with the most to prove is Devon Setoguchi. Between Nov. 30 and last Tuesday, when he was scratched from a game for missing a team meeting, Setoguchi had one goal. He scored in his first game back but will have to pick up the pace considerably.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flight plan: road wins</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are several <span class="companylink">NHL</span> teams that need to pick up the pace as the all-star break comes on the horizon after getting off to a good start to the season. Among them are the Minnesota Wild, Pittsburgh Penguins and Dallas Stars. All three are on the bubble for a playoff position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also needing to pull up their socks are the Winnipeg Jets, Buffalo Sabres and Tampa Bay Lightning, among others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Jets are an interesting case study, since they played like champs at home until recently and were chumps on the road. Perhaps that might be attributed to the lively atmosphere at their home, the MTS Centre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of the Jets can lapse into a prolonged snooze in front of the home crowd, which is often a problem on the road. The rink may be the smallest in the league but the fans have quickly earned a reputation as the noisiest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is important on a team with an uncertain group of forwards. The Jets are in contention because of goaltending and defence. On the road, the forwards often do not establish their fore-checking but an appreciative home crowd seems to keep their feet moving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They need to do that more on the road. A great opportunity for that awaits, as the Jets play in Ottawa against the Senators on Monday and then in Newark, N.J., against the New Jersey Devils on Tuesday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One guy said, “The Republicans will go nuts complaining about this.” Another said, “No, they won't. They'll just call it a liberal media hatchet job.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday night I sat in a room with about 50 American journalists to watch HBO's docudrama Game Change (airs HBO Canada, Mar. 10). The movie is based on the bestselling book of the same name about recent American presidential campaigns by journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The movie dramatizes only one section – the John McCain campaign in 2008 from the choice of Sarah Palin as candidate for vice-president to the night McCain lost. The movie, like the book, is not speculative or drawn from hearsay. Much of it is based on an account of the McCain campaign by Steve Schmidt, a Republican Party campaign strategist, who is played by Woody Harrelson in the movie, with multiple eyewitness corroborations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Watching it with the American journalists was an education. At first, as the movie opened with McCain (Ed Harris) and his advisers discussing potential running mates, there was a jaunty satirical tone. There was laughter in the room. Even as the Palin character (Julianne Moore plays her with aplomb) entered the picture, all gee-whiz enthusiasm, there was lots of laughter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the laughing stopped. There was silence. Then there were groans of embarrassment. Not because the movie is mediocre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's actually thrillingly good. But because the depth of Palin's ignorance of the world became clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a devastating portrait of Palin. And a searing indictment of the McCain camp for selecting her. As the movie tells it, Palin was vetted quickly and became the running mate in order to swiftly boost McCain's chances against a soaring Barack Obama. Then, after Palin's unveiling as the running mate, the team, especially Schmidt, set about preparing her for media interviews and a vice-presidential candidates debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was around that period in the movie that many reporters in the room sighed. Some cursed. Others slumped in their chairs. It is made crystal clear that Palin didn't really understand why there was a North Korea and a South Korea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She clearly thought that Saddam Hussein was behind the 9/11 attacks. She needed to have Germany's role in the Second World War explained to her. She thought “the Fed” referred to the federal government, not the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>. The Governor of Alaska was as ignorant of the world as a four-year-old. Except of course, voters were being asked to put this ludicrously uninformed person, in the proverbial phrase, “a heartbeat away from the presidency.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under pressure, but with a profound sense of her own importance, Palin crumbles. In one scene, she is catatonic, curled up, immobile in a fetal position because she's been dieting. In another she screams at a McCain staffer on her cellphone and then smashes the phone against a wall. She is depicted as someone who could be taught to memorize generic replies to questions from journalists, but could not recognize her own ignorance. As the movie shows it, after every appearance before cheering crowds her ego swelled and she simply declined to listen to any advice about anything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key scene, memorably surreal, shows Julianne Moore as Palin watching Tina Fey play Palin on TV. Palin's face is rigid with mystification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Game Change is great drama grounded in an uncomfortable political reality. Sarah Palin soared to the top of American politics an ignoramus. That is why many reporters watching it seemed scarred by the experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, the cast and producers came here to discuss the movie. Most questions were, understandably, aimed at Julianne Moore, who had the daunting task of playing a vital contemporary figure in the American culture. Any accusation of a “liberal media hatchet job” were lessened by Moore's take on Palin. Personally, she said, she's sympathetic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I certainly have profound respect for the historical nature of her candidacy. I mean, from where she was taken out of state government, to be thrust into a national and international stage like this that was a tremendous amount of pressure. And that was the other thing I was attempting to capture. What was that like, that pressure cooker kind of atmosphere? What does that do to somebody psychologically? The fact that she was able to perform the way she was able to, was simply amazing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McCain is treated kindly in the movie, depicted as a man who allowed himself to be persuaded to have Palin as a running mate and came to rue it. Ed Harris said, “You know, he's a man of a tremendous sense of honour and duty, and when he decided to go into politics, I think that by his own admission, his ambition and his ego were in constant conflict with this sense of honour and duty and patriotism. It was an interesting thing to play with, in the portraying of him.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's actors talking. Danny Strong, who wrote and co-produced the movie was more direct in discussing what unfolds in Game Change. “Well, I think politics has become entertainment and that's a lot about what this film is about, about the nature of celebrity in politics where the 24-hour news cycle, at this point, it's not even about news. It's about entertainment. It doesn't matter even what happens. It's ephemeral. You are supposed to forget it the next day because then there's a new, entertaining story that's supposed to grab you the day after that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the movie is about the blurring of politics and celebrity, I can report an interesting vignette to add to the surreal nature of watching the movie with American journalists and then hearing it discussed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most actors who come to the TV critics press tour arrive and leave in a limousine. Not Ed Harris. I was hanging around when he left the hotel on Friday. He got into a pickup truck, presumably his own, and drove off. As the truck pulled out I saw a single bumper sticker on the back. It said, “OBAMA 08.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gwyn Morgan is a Canadian business leader and a director of two global corporations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">History has shown that good times foster a complacency that eventually takes a toll on business performance, while tough times foster the sacrifices and adjustments needed to improve. While Canada's economy has weathered the recession far better than that of the beleaguered U.S., the long-standing American productivity advantage has accelerated. Economists estimate that during 2010 American labour productivity grew more than three times faster than in Canada.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business-friendly policies of the Carolinas together with a high productivity and largely non-union work force have long attracted auto, aircraft and hi-tech manufacturers. Since the recession, their high productivity ethos has spread across the country. Labour costs have dropped dramatically through a combination of investment in new technology and reduced wages and benefits accepted by workers who don't want to see their employer go out of business. This “get better or give up” mentality has driven a dramatic surge in productivity from our biggest trading partner, and our biggest competitor. Meanwhile, Canadian salaries and benefits have remained steady or even grown. These competitive challenges have been magnified by the high flying loonie that has risen more than 50 per cent in value from US $0.64 to near par over the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian manufacturing jobs have been moving south for some time, but the New Year's Day lockout of workers at the Electro-Motive Diesel plant in London, Ont., resonated like a rifle-shot. The subsidiary of global giant <span class="companylink">Caterpillar Inc</span>. has tabled an offer with the Canadian Auto Workers Union that would cut wages and benefits by some 50 per cent in order to bring the plant in line with costs at its La Grange, Ill., facility. Management has made it clear that since it cannot maintain a Canadian operation costing twice as much, the alternative is to close the plant and move the jobs south.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Union leaders reacted by calling for government intervention to end the lockout and Canadian Labour Congress President Ken Georgetti demanded new laws preventing foreign acquisitions such as Caterpillar's 2010 takeover of Electro-Motive. But the reality is, whether the company is Canadian or foreign owned, it couldn't have stayed in business facing a 50 per cent cost disadvantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's clear that, in such head-to-head competitions, workers will continue to face a choice between accepting lower compensation or unemployment. As painful as these choices will be, Canadians must accept the reality that this accelerating cross-border productivity gap is little different than the lower cost competition that has drawn production line jobs to China and India. So how should Canadian businesses respond? Here are three thoughts on that crucial question:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, focus on producing goods where there are advantages to in-country production. In most cases, this means made-to-order custom manufacturing working directly with local customers, rather than easily moved lower value added large-scale production line operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, rather than listening to those voices lamenting that so much of Canada's economic buoyancy and growth is driven by our rich resource endowment, we should embrace and make the most of the numerous and diverse country-wide manufacturing opportunities they present. A prime example is the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in B.C. shale gas, Alberta oilsands and offshore Newfoundland oilfields. Design engineers and contractors work together with custom fabricators across the country, resulting in a major portion of the equipment manufactured right here in Canada. Now is the time for manufacturers to take advantage of our strong dollar to acquire the specialized equipment needed to maximize productivity. This has already been a significant factor in helping many Canadian businesses adapt to foreign competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest threat to Canada's living standards lies in the complacency of the comfortable. Both the private and public sectors must take urgent action to deliver more with less. The fact that our American neighbours are facing a more difficult time has led to strong efficiency gains. Unless we capitalize on our strengths with a similar sense of urgency, the tables will soon turn.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While training for a marathon I developed some back pain. My doctor told me my glutes are not strong and I need to strengthen them. The pain is because my back is compensating. Can you suggest some exercises?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When running, the glutes should be the muscle group primarily responsible for pulling the leg backward. When the glutes pull the leg back behind the body, the motion is called “hip extension.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the glutes are not firing properly, the body has to find a compensation pattern. Often extension ends up occurring through the lower back instead of the hip. This can cause an overuse injury of the lower back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, this is a somewhat common problem for runners. I suggest all runners incorporate glute-strengthening exercises into their routine to help prevent this problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get the glutes to fire, try these exercises:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bridges: Lie on your back with your legs bent, feet placed hip distance apart on the ground. Engage your bum muscles to lift your hips off of the ground. Try not to lift with your hamstrings (back of legs) or lower back. Repeat 10 times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Side leg lifts: Lie on your right side. Lift your left leg up to hip height. Imagine your leg weighs 100 pounds and that you have to use your bum muscles (the ones located just behind the side seam of your pants) to lift the leg up. Repeat 10 times and switch sides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Note: If you have undiagnosed back pain, meet with a physiotherapist or sports doctor before you incorporate any new exercises into your routine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trainer's Tip</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Make sure you stretch your hip flexors, because if they are tight they can inhibit your bum muscles from working. Stand in a lunge position. Bend your back knee and tuck your pelvis so your hip bones come toward your ribs. Reach the arm on the same side of your back leg up toward the ceiling. Hold for 30 seconds.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hungary's democracy is in danger, not so much because of individual articles of the country's new constitution, but because of their alarming cumulative effect, especially in the document's relentless use (or abuse) of as many as 50 “cardinal laws,” which can only be revised or repealed by a two-thirds supermajority in future parliaments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The European Commission's warning to Hungary last Wednesday may seem timid, with its expression of concern about such matters as the retirement age of judges, but it is an unprecedented political step for the bureaucratic commission.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Victor Orban, the Prime Minister, and his Fidesz party first became famous, he and it were anti-Soviet libertarians. Now, they stand for an overwrought nationalism that leaps out from the pages of the constitution. The Soviet-era constitution of 1949 certainly needed to be replaced, but Fidesz is now taking an unethical advantage of its two-thirds parliamentary majority to entrench a very extensive legislative program, making it difficult for future governments to make changes – unless they too have an equally large majorities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Continental Europe, “organic” or “cardinal” laws are not unusual, being statutes with quasi-constitutional status that provide frameworks for governmental activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the new Hungarian constitution, already bulky in itself, requires a host of cardinal acts covering a large range of spheres, including financial regulation, policing, pensions, family law, rights of ethnic groups, churches, political parties and more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is paradoxically fortunate that Mr. Orban, like his predecessors, is a bad financial manager. Hungary will need help to remain solvent. Consequently, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund have considerable leverage for insisting on reasonably democratic governance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comparisons of Mr. Orban to Admiral Horthy, the fascist ruler of Hungary from 1920 to 1944, are exaggerated, but the attempt of his government to enact a program that future administrations will be hard-pressed to change is anti-democratic; external pressure from the EU, the IMF and others is amply justified.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the one hand, Texas congressman Ron Paul, Republican presidential candidate, is a zealous champion of limited government, free markets and low taxes. On the other hand, he reportedly thinks the U.S. should not have gone to war against Nazi Germany. What to make of this heresy? A great deal – for it may define Mr. Paul's isolationism.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine for a moment that Mr. Paul, not Franklin Roosevelt, served as U.S. president and commander-in-chief in the Second World War. Imagine that the U.S. went to war against only Japan, that Germany won the war in Europe – and that Hitler was able to keep the death camps running through the Age of Aquarius.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paul justifies his isolationism on strictly fiscal grounds. End the wars, end the taxes required to wage them. For some Americans, this seems a reasonable proposition. But this is almost certainly an evasion. Mr. Paul's isolationism extends beyond fiscal restraint – and reaches implicitly to global surrender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his 2011 book Liberty Defined, for example, Mr. Paul cites Israel as a racist state that threatens American freedom. In a Boxing Day blog, former senior aide Eric Dondero – just fired for insubordination after 12 years of service – elaborated: Mr. Paul “most certainly is anti-Israel, and anti-Israeli in general. … His view is that Israel is more trouble than it is worth, specifically to the America taxpayer. He sides with the Palestinians, and supports their calls for the abolition of the Jewish state, and the return of Israel, all of it, to the Arabs.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Weekly Standard, a conservative journal, quoted Mr. Dondero further: Mr. Paul “does not believe that the United States had any business getting involved in fighting Hitler. He expressed to me countless times, that ‘saving the Jews' was absolutely none of our business.” A few days later, Weekly Standard reporter John McCormack asked Mr. Paul four times to respond: Was Mr. Dondero telling the truth? Four times, Mr. McCormack said, he “remained silent.” Mr. Paul's campaign staff subsequently clarified his silence: If Congress had declared war on Germany, Mr. Paul, as commander-in-chief, would have felt constitutionally obliged to wage it. (Germany, in fact, declared war on the U.S. first.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This apparent reluctance to wage war on Nazi Germany goes beyond Mr. Paul. In his 2008 book Churchill, Hitler, and the Unnecessary War, controversial author Pat Buchanan (who himself once ran for the Republican presidential nomination) documents this dark, enduring niche in American conservatism. Mr. Buchanan blames Churchill, not Hitler, for the Second World War.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, though, Mr. Paul gets even his economic argument wrong. The essential obligation of any state is defence – which doesn't come free. Mr. Paul would take the U.S. out of NATO; would close American bases around the world; would end American foreign aid. But the U.S. cost of self-defence would inevitably rise, not fall, with each of these retreats into Fortress America. Would the U.S. Navy have use only of American ports? How long would international waterways remain open to unrestricted global commerce? What's the ultimate financial cost of long-term appeasement?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. defence spending is already at a record low, or very close to it, relative to GDP. U.S. military spending has increased 90 per cent since 9/11, yet remains far below its historical share of GDP. The U.S. spent 40 per cent of its GDP, for three years, to win the Second World War. The U.S. fought the Cold War for 30 years at a GDP cost of 10 per cent a year. By 2000, though, U.S. defence spending was costing only 3.6 per cent of GDP: 3.6 cents per dollar of the national economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2010, this cost almost doubled – to 6 per cent (all war costs included). But this cost is already falling. The Congressional Budget Office says that, with an end to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, the country's defence cost will fall back to 4.6 per cent within three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who balk at paying four cents on the dollar for a nation's defence (or, in Canada's case, 1.5 cents) need to know exactly what wars they would fight and what wars they would skip. The Second World War wasn't the first absolutely essential moral war in human history – and it won't be the last.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dear Jack,</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that you've come back again, I'm having second thoughts. Sorry. I know I have a strange relationship with you. But I just can't help it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most years, when you arrive on time and do all the things you're supposed to do, I resent you. You dump your snow all over the place, willy-nilly. Ice is left in the ditches. You abuse my car. You mess up my sidewalks. I don't like what you do to my boots. To be honest, there's only so much frigidity a girl can take.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All I can think about is escaping you. And if I can't – because, hey, it takes a fair amount of dough to fly clear of your grip – I start dreaming about how glorious it will be when you clear off for good (or at least for a good seven months) so that I don't have to think about you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then last week, when you were nowhere in sight, and there was no hint of any visit, I found myself thinking about you. I had been enjoying the balmy temperatures, wearing a light coat, no scarf, no hat. I was feeling pretty wonderful. But then it hit me. This just doesn't feel right. I missed you terribly, I realized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I thought about all the things you do, which in their absence, seem absolutely adorable. I got all mushy thinking about the way you encourage me and my neighbours to come out onto the street, all about the same time, to clear away your mess. It makes for a community event. We lean against the tops of our shovels, taking a break, and talk about what's going on – a throw-back to the days when most communication was face-to-face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I even like the sounds you help create: the scraping off of car windshields, the sound of a shovel scrunching against the sidewalk's surface. And there's something terribly satisfying about making nice neat snowbanks and clear paths. It's like organizing your bookshelves alphabetically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wished you would come back. You're good for me in a way I hadn't appreciated before. I like how you give me an excuse not to go out if I don't feel like it. It's good to recuse yourself from society for a little bit. Hibernation is a like a spiritual retreat. You make me think. When living with you, I get a lot of work done. I read a lot. I relax in front of a fire. I plan what I want to do. And I know this sounds corny, but when you move in, you soften the world a little bit. You make it slow down. I'll admit it: I need you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I even did some investigation to find out what had been the matter with you, why you had been keeping your distance. Some therapist type, who claims to be good at diagnosing you and forecasting how you might feel in the days to come, said you had been suffering from something called North Atlantic Oscillation? Something about the natural fluctuations in air pressure over the northern Atlantic Ocean that influence the movement of storm systems across the continent? Well, I had no idea. Sounded terrible. Worse than the flu. And I instantly regretted my rather mean-spirited assessment of you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then, as is your wont, you whooshed back in, unannounced, and all those feelings about what I don't like about you resurfaced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, I know, my affections are fickle. I feel like I'm in one of those tortuous, dysfunctional relationships. Can't live with you – for long, anyway. And yet can't live without you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think it has to do with needing change. I just can't settle down with one person right now. Commitment issues. I have the same problem with that other personality, His Hotness. Sure, I break into a sweat when he first appears. But by the time he's ready to leave, I'm growing sick of him. That dude swaggers around town and likes himself a bit too much, if you ask me. He's overwhelming. And he brings along his own behavioural irritations, too, you know. And where you encourage me to be thoughtful, he's all about frivolity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which explains why I always come away from my little dance with him, looking forward to your arrival. I await your first snowflake with a little thrill of anticipation – a delicate letter of intention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, you see, it's me, not you. Still, I have a thought about compromise. If we could have more of a part-time relationship, more flirtatious – that could really work well. Maybe weekends only? Earlier in the winter, we were started in this direction. You had made fleeting attempts to move in. There were a few encounters. Mostly, you kept your snow to yourself. And then, just like that, you left town again, leaving everything bare and clean. And I kind of liked that. It showed consideration – dropping in briefly, to remind me that you still care, but then stepping away so as not to get on my nerves. Could we try that again?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let me know what you think. Okay?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thinking about the Arctic as a whole conjures images of snow, extreme weather, vast ice-covered landscapes and seascapes, polar bears. The bustling markets of New Delhi or the Great Wall of China do not frequently come to mind, but these are places that might be closely associated with the future Arctic. As the world eyes the potential for resources and development in the Far North, countries as diverse as China, India, Japan, Spain and Italy are seeking a role for themselves.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What are these countries doing, or what do they want to be doing, in the Arctic? In public statements, the main emphasis is clear: science. China, for example, has built a research station in the Svalbard Islands and is building an 8,000-tonne icebreaker. Other countries are similarly interested in the Arctic as the “canary in the coal mine” that can teach them about how climate change will affect their own states. They are also interested in potential access to the vast hydrocarbons and resources in the region, as well as international transit routes passing over the top of the globe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the growing focus on the region, the broader question of who is in and who is out in the Arctic is coming to the fore. The Arctic Council – the main body for co-operation in the region – is struggling with this question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The eight Arctic Council states are divided. Norway, Finland and Denmark have spoken openly about the need to bring more non-Arctic states into the fold, while Canada and Russia have been most averse to the idea of extending permanent observer status in the council to more non-Arctic states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the one hand, some fear that admitting more non-Arctic states (and international organizations) to permanent observer status would dilute the important voice that indigenous groups (the permanent participants) have in Arctic Council meetings. The simple fact that indigenous peoples have a formal place at the table is one of the Arctic Council's central claims to innovativeness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, if non-Arctic states are not given a permanent role to play in the council, will they be forced to raise Arctic issues in venues where Arctic states are a minority, like the United Nations General Assembly? Over time, would this reduce the Arctic states' ability to control the Arctic agenda?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if non-Arctic states are invited to become “permanent observers” to the Arctic Council, they will not hold the same rights, powers and obligations of Arctic states. Members will continue to have far more power than their observer counterparts. Admitting more non-Arctic observers into the Arctic Council may actually yield beneficial results. For example, setting membership fees for observers to support the permanent participants could help to facilitate a stronger indigenous voice by making sure their representatives not only have a seat at council and working group tables, but that they can actually get there to participate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada will take over the chair of the Arctic Council in 2013 and should be prepared to face these questions. The debate over the balance between Arctic states, indigenous groups and non-Arctic states in the Arctic Council continues, but it is clear that non-Arctic states are interested in the tremendous changes taking place in the circumpolar world. Their interest is not a fleeting fancy. Arctic states and leaders need to discern how best to harness this growing interest to generate positive engagement and greater opportunities for Arctic residents.</p>
