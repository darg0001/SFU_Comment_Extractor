<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The short story is said to be an endangered species, a literary form once as ubiquitous as buffalo on the prairie now doomed to become the purview of an elite few.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The format blossomed a century ago, its popularity enhanced by publication in magazines with mass readership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every newsstand carried posters advertising a magazine's serialized novel, or a popular writer's latest short story. Fiction was a staple of the popular magazine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alas, today the short story seems more likely to be found in a journal produced by a literary press associated with a university. Reviews are rare, shelf space at the bookstore limited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One place in which the genre thrives is Victoria, which counts among its practitioners such accomplished writers as John Gould, Bill Gaston, Yasuko Thanh, and M.A.C. Farrant, among others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The late Carol Shields made her home here, as did the peerless Alice Munro, who lives in Ontario in the summer and in Comox in winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another brave scribbler unwilling to abandon the form is Daniel Griffin, 40, whose first collection, Stopping for Strangers, was recently published by Esplanade Books, the fiction imprint of Véhicule Press of Montreal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The stories are about families in crisis,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Family under pressure. People trying to connect. About young people who may have become parents earlier than they would have chosen. People who are struggling to do the right thing under the circumstances.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People talk about these stories being dark. I don't see them the same way. I hope I'm taking a compassionate look at the darker corners of our lives in this time.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the opening story, Promise, the protagonist detours to visit his brother's estranged wife. She has been beaten and is in grave danger. A subtle reference made in passing to a street name – Helmcken, rendered here as Helmken – places the story on Vancouver Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(John S. Helmcken was a surgeon with the <span class="companylink">Hudson's Bay Co</span>. His house still stands on its original site next to the Royal B.C. Museum.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Helmken borders forest,” Mr. Griffin writes. “Deep dark stands of cedar climb a gentle slope on one side of the street and tower over the bungalows opposite. Here people lived on the cleaned-up corners of the land. Wilderness begins at the end of every street. Two steps off the paved road the world turns raw and wild.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin's stories turn on suicide, violence, infidelity, lingering hospital deaths, but those events happen on the periphery. The writer is more interested in relationships and missed connections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Difficult things happen in these stories,” he said “The characters aren't always the most lovable. But those people exist out there.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin's work has been compared to that of Raymond Carver, a writer whom he cites as an inspiration. Joel Yanofsky in the Montreal Review of Books praised Mr. Griffin's “economical, unadorned prose.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such spare work is the result more of rewriting then writing. He is a stern editor, revising and reworking his own work again an again. “When the writing is in red ink, it looks like blood, all over the margins and onto the backside,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade of winnowing has resulted in the 10 crystalline stories found in this collection, including The Last Great Works of Alvin Cale, a finalist for the Journey Prize in 2009, which was won that year by Ms. Thanh. (At $10,000, the Journey is the 6/49 of short-story awards.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin was born in Kingston, Ont., where his father, Malcolm, is now emeritus professor of mathematics at Queen's University, while his mother, Sharon Thompson, is an accomplished painter. One of three brothers, he grew up in a home of serious purpose – no television, and classical music on the turntable. Non-fiction trumped fiction. Novels were regarded as “a nice escape,” he recalls, “but a little indulgent.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While working as a blacksmith at Fort George, a national historic site, fellow workers introduced him to Canadian literature, and he devoured Timothy Findley and Robertson Davies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin spends two hours every day – in the morning and at lunchtime – working on his writing, a disciplined habit he maintained even in the chaos of a year spent in Chennai (formerly Madras), India. He moved there with his wife, Kim, and their daughters Evelyn, Tessa and Vivian, now aged 6 to 11. He helped open an office for his brother's tech company. The family returned to Victoria a fortnight ago.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Dalton McGuinty discusses health care with his fellow premiers in Victoria this week, back in Ontario, his government is bracing for labour talks that could have a huge impact on how medical services are delivered.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of March, the <span class="companylink">Ontario Medical Association</span>'s current contract will expire. That gives the deficit-plagued government one of its best opportunities to rein in soaring health costs by targeting the roughly $10-billion it spends annually on doctors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To bend the cost curve meaningfully, insiders say, a showy gesture of wage restraint won't be enough. Instead, it will require structural changes to the way doctors go about their jobs – ones that would directly affect how they interact with their patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just how much of a fight Mr. McGuinty's Liberals will be up for remains to be seen. But based on conversations with government and health-sector sources, here are some of the key areas the government will be trying to target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FEWER FEES, MORE SERVICE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province will continue trying to get more family doctors away from fee-for-service. But that won't do much good if it doesn't get better value out of “family health teams,” which a majority of doctors have already moved toward because the Liberals provided financial incentives to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea of those units, in which doctors work alongside colleagues and other health professionals and receive annual payments for each patient, is to provide more comprehensive coverage – and in turn to save the government money by keeping more people out of hospital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liberals now concede that because they didn't do enough in previous negotiations to ensure doctors make themselves available to their patients, including through “after-hours” services, it hasn't worked as well as hoped. They'll now seek to rectify that, arguing that doctors in family health teams are being overpaid for what they currently deliver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RATIONING CARE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doctors have traditionally had a great deal of discretion in administering care. That's led to a belief among people in and around government that prescriptions or referrals are sometimes offered more to keep patients happy than out of medical necessity – and that setting tighter guidelines for when to write them could save large sums of money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Understandably, people who spent much of their lives studying medicine don't appreciate politicians or bureaucrats telling them how to do their jobs. So the Liberals will try to engage doctors themselves in writing new rules or guidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike some other potential reforms, this one could create a public backlash if it appears the government is skimping on common treatments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EASIER, FASTER … CHEAPER?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the most common criticisms of current health expenditures is that the government still pays specialists very high fees for procedures that were once long and difficult and are now quicker and more routine. Cataract surgery is the most common example, but cardiology and radiology also come up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government might argue that if it pays less to those doctors, it could afford more services from others. But it's unlikely that the OMA, which faces strong pressures from within, will just throw some of its members under the bus. As a result, it may go along with reduced fees for certain procedures only if the doctors who perform them get additional compensation in some other form.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RECONNECTING WITH HOSPITALS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A familiar argument, to be repeated in economist Don Drummond's much-hyped report on public services, is that there is too big a gulf between primary care and hospitals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A partial solution, to ensure information about patients is shared between the two sides, is electronic medical records. On that front, the government dropped the ball and is still playing catch-up. But it may nevertheless use the talks to try to get more buy-in from doctors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's also concern that too many doctors have withdrawn from hospital duty, in some cases leaving emergency rooms and other facilities understaffed. That could prove a much more controversial topic if the government tries to force new requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHERE, IF AT ALL, THE DOCTOR WILL SEE YOU</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going to the doctor's office won't become a thing of the past. But there are a couple of ways the province might try to get Ontarians going there less often.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One would be encouraging more interaction with patients via telephone or e-mail, particularly for follow-up. The key here would be to get doctors who are still on fee-for-service to accept lower rates for that form of service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As well, there's the commitment the Liberals made during the campaign to get doctors to make more house calls. While mostly a quality-of-life promise aimed at getting votes, there's arguably a savings component here as well if it helps to keep seniors living in their homes rather than needing long-term care.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's an ominous new meaning for two-tier medicine in Canada: rather than one system for rich people and one for the poor, it will be one system for rich provinces and one for the poor.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa has unilaterally declared a new health-care funding formula that eschews the old prescription of giving poorer provinces proportionately more health-care dollars than richer ones, substituting a per-capita formula that removes the built-in penalty for economic growth. The result is a health-care fight at the Victoria meeting of the country's first ministers that has become a proxy for the larger forces reshaping the balance of power in the country: a clash that pits the fast-growing, resource-rich West against the East.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any doubt about this was quelled when Quebec Premier Jean Charest stepped to the microphone first thing Monday morning and talked about federalism's new truth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are two realities in Canada,” said the Premier. “There are the economies of oil, gas and potash – and others. That's the reality of Canada, and once we know that, we need, I think, to be able to make decisions accordingly.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Mr. Charest means, we assume, is that the West is richer than the East thanks to access to valuable raw resources. And this, he believes, needs to be taken into account in areas such as health-care funding. The wealthy should subsidize the less fortunate so our provincial governments don't unwittingly create a two-tier health system of a different sort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Quebec Premier's lament certainly echoed past complaints from the poorer provinces. And it was no surprise that his position wasn't sympathetically embraced by Alison Redford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the Alberta Premier again applauded a new federal “per capita” funding formula she says treats all Canadians equally. In other words, those living in her province don't receive proportionally less for health care than someone living in Nova Scotia or Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the premiers were saying what you might expect about the prospect of a two-tier health system in Canada, one divided along economic lines. Whether it was host Premier Christy Clark or Ontario's Dalton McGuinty, the premiers insisted that every Canadian should have access to a comparable level of health care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But “comparable” is a fairly vague term of measurement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There isn't a truly equal level of health care in Canada even now. Wealthy provinces have hospitals and programs that poorer ones can only envy. Wait times for certain procedures can vary widely between jurisdictions. There is a reason for that. The health budgets of some eastern provinces eat up their entire equalization payment. That is not the case for provinces such as B.C. and Alberta, where the economies are growing and the governments can afford to pour dollars into their health-care systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is: Will Ottawa's new no-strings-attached funding proposal exacerbate the discrepancies in health care that already exist? And does Ottawa even care if it does?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless Stephen Harper and the Conservatives have an unexpected change of heart, it would seem this is going to be a problem the provinces are going to have to grapple with on their own. To that point, the sooner they begin sharing thoughts on how to start turning the health cost curve downward through innovation and best practices the better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be savings made through these types of initiatives that will allow poorer provinces to stay in the health-care game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moving ahead, it will be the provinces who make the health guarantees in Canada – not the federal government. It will be the provinces who will have to make themselves accountable to their citizens to deliver the same level of service across the country – not Ottawa. How they do that is something they're just starting to figure out now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We don't want 13 different health-care systems in Canada,” Ms. Clark said on Monday afternoon. “And we don't want different levels of care between provinces. Canadians expect the same care wherever they are.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge of delivering on that just got a whole lot harder.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roy Romanow, the former NDP premier of Saskatchewan, has been vehemently attacking the Harper government for reneging on its so-called leadership role in health care. In that, he has been echoing the recriminations of the opposition, which is incensed at the government's decision to stop using transfer payments as bargaining chips to force the provinces to submit to federal standards.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think the government's approach is highly commendable, a welcome break after decades of federal intrusion into a provincial jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty tabled a non-negotiable plan for long-term funding that was financially generous, and represented a much-needed change: Ottawa won't try to negotiate specific changes to the way health care is administered by the provinces, and they'll be free to do what they want with the federal money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is in line with the “open federalism” favoured by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and a perfectly sensible move since it's the provinces that know best about the needs of their citizens. The federal government has no particular expertise in health care; it's only responsible for veterans' health-care plans and for health services on aboriginal reserves – with less than sparkling results. This is a reality that the Liberals and NDP systematically ignore when they offer “promises” in every federal election to, for instance, increase the number of doctors in outlying regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 2002, Mr. Romanow authored a royal commission report on health-care reform. Predictably, he didn't suggest any fundamental change to the system that Tommy Douglas, the NDP's Holy Father, created 50 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His conclusion was that the federal government should pour additional billions into the system but that, in exchange, the provinces should proceed to reforms in pharmacare, and home and primary care. This is exactly what Quebec has been doing on its own: It has an extensive public drug plan and worked hard on the two other fronts. Yet, emergency wards are overflowing, waiting times are unacceptable and the system is bursting at the seams – Mr. Romanow's prescription didn't work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's needed is real change, ideally along the lines of what's been done in France, which developed (under several Socialist governments, to boot) a mixed public-private system that the World Health Organization rated the most efficient in the world in its last comparative report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does Mr. Harper believe? My guess is, like many others, he feels that, after 50 years, medicare needs to evolve. Considering the current state of public opinion, the law can't be abruptly modified to include, for instance, private medical clinics based on the models prevalent in Western Europe. So change must come from the bottom, and it would be for the greater good if the provinces were free to experiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is exactly what Mr. Romanow fears. He believes, as he told Postmedia News, that “national unity” would be imperilled if the provinces evolved differently. But he's in denial. Uniformity doesn't exist and never really did. The provinces are very different from each other on all counts, including health care. They don't have the same policies regarding access to home care, public drug and health plans or hospital management. Far from being a “patchwork-quilt series of programs by the provincial governments,” as Mr. Romanow says, it's the normal situation of a country that's as diverse as it's large.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is a positive to be taken from the cheery Liberal conflab on the weekend, it is not that the party is moving in any bristling new direction.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The message from Bob Rae was that the Grits are and will remain the non-ideological party, the party of the pragmatic centre where reason allegedly triumphs over gut prejudices of the left or right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Liberals are encouraged about is not new policy but the fact that the party is now in the hands of a seasoned political pro, one who has demonstrated a surefootedness that has been absent under the three previous leaders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be noted here is that Mr. Rae, first elected to the Commons at age 30, is a political careerist. To chart Canadian history is to see that the big majority of successful leaders, the latest manifestation being Stephen Harper, are career politicians. They've been consumed by politics since an early age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the Liberal side, witness big winners like Wilfrid Laurier, Mackenzie King, Jean Chrétien. They ran for office in their late 20s or early 30s. Politics was essentially their lifelong profession. They all posted outstanding electoral records. In more recent times, we've seen what happened to latecomers such as Stéphane Dion and Michael Ignatieff who arrived from the ivory tower world. They lacked political savvy, toughness, knowhow. They got run over by a hardened career professional.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While from a political family, Paul Martin was another latecomer, not entering the Commons until he turned 50. He was admirably keen on policy, but weak on political instincts and therefore overly dependent on inner-circle advisers whose brilliant counsel included a let's-bleed-ourselves-to-death inquiry into the sponsorship scandal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Political instincts are woven over time, much time. Everyone thought John Turner had the right stuff. But he left politics for nine years and by the time he came back, the instincts were gone. They had deteriorated so much that he let himself get all tied up in knots over a series of patronage appointments by his predecessor, Pierre Trudeau. Although not a career politician, Mr. Trudeau had large-sized political ambitions from an early age and edited a political magazine, Cité Libre. Lester Pearson was a latecomer to politics and while successful, to some extent, it showed. He should have but was never able to win a majority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the Conservative side, the three biggest political winners were career politicians. John A. Macdonald entered politics in his late 20s. Brian Mulroney, the first Tory to win back to back majorities since the great master, was consumed by politics since university days. Stephen Harper first ran for the Reform Party at 29.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are exceptions, of course, but as a general rule, if you are not a political careerist, if you are not steeped in politics by your early 30s, chances of becoming a successful leader are remote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Liberals, the experience and professionalism Mr. Rae brings are what is needed at this time. With an election four years away, policy can wait. The one big issue he emphasized in his closing convention speech was income inequality. He sees this as a good prong with which to attack the Conservatives' economic record. But absent from his talk are big new initiatives such as a national energy/industrial strategy to move Canada off its reliance on a petro-dollar economy – the older hewer-of-wood, drawer-of-water dependency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until he is permanent leader, it is the party's operations that are the top priority. The troubling question is whether the process of his gaining the full-time leadership will return the Liberals to infighting and disunity. Leadership contenders will come forward by the fall. If Mr. Rae's standing is strong in the polls, he will have an easy time. If it isn't, there will be several challengers, quite possibly including Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Great news for political scientists! Federalism is back in vogue.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government has declined to negotiate a new health-care deal with the provinces. Minister of Finance Jim Flaherty simply announced how much federal money would be made available and left it up to the provinces to decide how to spend it. Then, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the same minister's plan for creating a national securities regulator was an unconstitutional invasion of the provinces' power over property and civil rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both decisions point in the direction of classical federalism, that is, respect for the jurisdictions accorded to both levels of government, federal and provincial, by the Constitution, recognizing that federalism is a system of divided sovereignty, in which each level of government has powers that cannot be taken away by the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Duh,” as my students might say. It all seems pretty obvious. But it is not obvious in Canada, because for the past half-century our version of federalism – often called executive federalism – has moved far away from the classical model. The federal government has involved itself in numerous areas of provincial jurisdiction, including health, education and welfare, by using the so-called spending power. This power, not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution, rests on the assumption that the federal government can spend money – i.e., give it to the provinces – for any purpose at all, even if the purpose is a matter of provincial, not federal jurisdiction. And with the giving come the conditions, such as the federal insistence that the provinces not allow extra billing for health services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proponents of executive federalism often use the argument that the provinces cannot afford to pay for the modern welfare state because the Constitution restricts them to imposing only direct taxes, whereas the federal government can raise money “by any mode or system of taxation.” But there are two other far more important reasons for demanding that the federal government involve itself in provincial jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One motive for inventing the federal spending power was a quasi-socialist desire to redistribute wealth from more prosperous to less prosperous provinces. I call it “quasi-socialist” because regional redistribution does not necessarily entail taking money from richer people and giving it to poorer people. The working class in Saskatchewan is required to contribute to the equalization payments that finance cheap daycare and tuition for the children of the Quebec bourgeoisie. Where's Karl Marx when we need him?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other reason, perhaps only dimly articulated in the minds of proponents, is the national government's greater borrowing power. Everywhere in the world, the welfare state has been built on sovereign debt; and the national government, with its greater share of sovereignty and greater population base, seems like a better credit risk than the provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowing to finance social programs may have seemed like a good idea at the time, but it has produced levels of public indebtedness now recognized as a serious danger – and not just in Greece and Italy. Canada is close to the danger point, too, when provincial and federal debts are added together, and unfunded public pension liabilities are taken into account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executive federalism, with its jurisdictional confusion, has contributed mightily to the problem by generating so many shared-cost programs. Such programs create the illusion for both levels of government that they are spending something less than 100-cent dollars. But there is only one taxpayer, so debt accumulates relentlessly, whether it is booked to federal or provincial accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Classical federalism and classical liberalism are philosophical siblings. Both are premised on limited government enforcing necessary rules of conduct but not trying to direct civil society. In the Canadian context, the revival of classical federalism is an essential part of the revival of classical liberalism, with emphasis on smaller government, lower taxes and balanced budgets. It is good news that Stephen Harper's Conservative government is now moving incrementally toward both classical federalism and classical liberalism.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost every week there's a walkathon or some other “-athon” for a disease or cause. But the bigger “disease” of poverty, hunger and disaster affects far more people in the world. Can't we mobilize all of the fundraisers for one year to worldwide issues?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ANSWER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be incredible if we could unite the entire human race around one cause, as in the famed commercial jingle from the 1970s. Except instead of buying the world a Coke, this time we'd end global hunger and poverty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that's not the issue most Canadians would pick. According to Samantha Nutt, the founder of War Child Canada, only about 5 per cent of Canadian donations each year go to support international charities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we understand the gist of your question, but we respectfully disagree with focusing on just a handful of worldwide issues. We must have sufficient compassion to assist the most vulnerable both at home and abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This winter, we were shocked by news of the horrific conditions at the Attawapiskat First Nation in Northern Ontario – families lacking running water, people living in tents and many homes missing proper heating as temperatures plummet to -15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We strongly believe that “charity begins at home.” We make personal donations to domestic causes that are meaningful to us, including mental illness, homeless youth and supporting aboriginal Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, charity cannot end at city or national borders, especially when one billion people – 30 Canadas – have no access to safe drinking water, one billion go to bed hungry every night and four million die of malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS every year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giving to charity is an intensely personal choice with no right or wrong answer, but our personal mantra focuses half of our efforts to support Canadian causes and half to international issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You have to find your own balance among local, national and international charities. The key, we believe, is not to pit one cause against the other, but to encourage more giving over all.</p>

White-gloved stewards fuss over passengers, who are offered endless rounds of lobster tail and mojitos, and every imaginable form of entertainment from casinos and live music to history lessons and cooking classes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the grounding of the Costa Concordia, 100 metres off the Italian island of Giglio, and the chaotic evacuation of its 4,200 passengers, raise serious questions about the safety, training and rigour in the industry. That the captain, Francisco Schettino, allegedly abandoned the 114,500-tonne, six-year-old vessel, and is now in detention for sailing off course without authorization, is worrying enough.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More troubling is the very fact that a ship of this magnitude, sailing in well-charted waters, could hit a rock, and that there were delays in the evacuation. Even the most basic precautions may not have been taken. There are reports that the ship only held safety drills every 15 days, so that not all passengers underwent a safety drill before the vessel embarked. If so, they were not briefed about the location of lifeboat muster stations and life jackets – basic and vital precautions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no room for complacency in this $34-billion-a-year industry, especially as the ships grow ever larger, the technology more sophisticated and the crew and passengers more diverse. Proper management and emergency operational procedures are more crucial than crystal and fine dining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The grounding of the Concordia killed at least six people, injured 60 and has left 16 people unaccounted for. Many had to swim ashore, because the ship's tilt put some life rafts out of service. Imagine the human costs, had the ship run into trouble further out at sea. “In the centenary year of the Titanic, we have once again been reminded of the risks involved in maritime activities,” noted the International Maritime Organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Passenger ship travel, at least in the developed world, remains very safe. However, Costa must reassure the public that it has implemented all possible measures to reduce accidents at sea caused by human error, and that the crew – and passengers – are properly trained in the unlikely event that one should occur.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Madonna was in the headlines days before she accepted her Golden Globe (for her song Masterpiece) and snapped at host Ricky Gervais Sunday night.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, Madonna made a comment about Lady Gaga on a Nightline appearance, a comment that lit up the Internet and was widely reported as worthy of the term “cat fight” a year after the two stars mock-battled each other in a Saturday Night Live sketch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having refrained, politely, for almost a year, the Queen of Pop finally weighed in on the question of whether Gaga's song Born This Way has similarities to her own 1989 song Express Yourself. Listeners have been comparing the two songs since Born This Way was released last February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Madonna's savoir faire as a marketer is unfailing: Her comment – she called Gaga's song “reductive”– has everyone talking about her again. But not so nicely. Madonna is being described as, let's say, an unpleasant woman, for having used a refined word that even her interlocutor had to look up in a dictionary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worse, Gaga's legion of fans, her Little Monsters, have staged an attack, lacerating Madonna for being “old,” and using crass, sexually derogatory language. When Madonna was expressing herself, she was making a clear, powerful call to women: Her song is a political anthem about our sexuality, autonomy and freedom. To see this message rejected by a younger audience, so many years later, is a bleak commentary on contemporary women's reductive sense of each other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, having sat down to talk with the staid ABC anchor Cynthia McFadden to promote W.E., her film about the scandalous love affair between Wallis Simpson and Prince Edward; her new album coming out in March (the first single is due this month), courtesy of her three-record, multimillion-dollar deal with Interscope and <span class="companylink">Live Nation</span>; and her upcoming half-time show at the Super Bowl Feb. 5, Madonna managed once again to secure our interest in her, one of the biggest brands in show business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is, she again piqued our interest in the woman we have long loved to hate: the artistic powerhouse and trend-riffing genius who always manages to come across as stiff, cold and unlikable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gaga, the modern Madonna (with regard to her style, sound and fame) has our attention as well, but she is warm and affable – never imperious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a Vanity Fair story last month, Lady Gaga cooked spaghetti from scratch at her parents' place for a besotted interviewer. Madonna, in dowager couture and with her legs indifferently spread, talked to McFadden as if she were a customs official. It's easy to see why her words are not being warmly received.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Madonna's backstabbing brother Christopher Ciccone has joined the fray, Perez Hilton has revealed, saying on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, that “fyi … M. wasn't being rude … she was trying to be funny, and of all the things she can do, funny isn't one of them … kinda like acting … ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ciccone, the weasel, is, unfortunately, right: Madonna cannot execute a joke and never could. But why should she joke about the song? Lady Gaga has said, not without rancour, that Born This Way merely follows the “chord progression” of 50 years of disco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If listening to a harrowing hour of the Trammps, the Bee Gees and Donna Summer disproves this theory, a side-by-side comparison of Born this Way and Express Yourself (this sort of mashup has been available on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> since the Gaga song was released) certainly makes the songs seem awfully similar. .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Madonna said in the Nightline interview that she likes and respects Gaga. Buried in her very slight dismissal of the song is the desire to be acknowledged by her vividly obvious protégée.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of pretending to have simply stood in line with the stalwarts of disco, Gaga should acknowledge her great and visible debt to Madonna's style and music.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that's not how we treat Madonna, is it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever since she tore her way into our consciousness, so many of us have listened to and despised her, without ever conceding there must be something phenomenal about her if she warrants such passionate responses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last few years, she has presented a kinder version of herself to the world. In interviews, she has spoken of her formerly rapacious ego; of having been, perhaps, an exhibitionist without a cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, on the fan blog The Lady Gaga Project, shockingly racist, even sexual, remarks are being posted about Madonna's adopted son, David (who was born in Malawi, where the singer does humanitarian work).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do these rabid fans actually believe Mother Monster (Gaga's name, in her fan manifesto) is a genuine family member? If she were their mother, one hopes she would severely punish them for their appalling conduct around this matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Madonna's message to her fans has always been at once democratizing (“C'mon girls!”) and aloof – she does not sign autographs; she keeps a cool distance offstage. She is, in other words, a true star, and a woman wise enough to know love and hate are sharp dual blades churning in the heads of fans. The great Gaga should learn this too, for her own stature, and safety.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a brilliant reason to get into our expensive and possibly weakening housing market right now. A 10-year mortgage is available for less than 4 per cent. You can thank the banks for this unheard-of rate. In the past week or so, competition between them on mortgage rates has gone nuclear.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Have you caught all the warnings about how the house that you can afford now because mortgage rates are so low will crush you when borrowing costs rise? With a 10-year mortgage, you've got long-term cost certainty. “This is a fantastic opportunity for somebody to lock in and have peace of mind for 10 years without worrying about a renewal,” said veteran mortgage broker Vince Gaetano of MonsterMortgage.ca.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Numbers released Monday show average prices are down almost 3 per cent since April, even after ticking a bit higher last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a conference last week, some of the country's top bankers talked as if a cooling in the market is a done deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price-wise, patience will very likely be rewarded in the housing market: Prices could easily decline enough to make a difference to buyers – especially in markets like Vancouver and Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But low mortgage rates also have a big impact on affordability, and that's a point that supports buying now if you plan to live in your house for a good long while and can afford the costs of home ownership while meeting your savings obligations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low is a word that may actually undersell what's happening in the mortgage market right now. Last week, <span class="companylink">Bank of Montreal</span> announced a 2.99-per-cent rate for five-year fixed-rate mortgages amortized over 25 years or less. That's the lowest rate on record for this type of mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other banks announced a special rate of 3.99 per cent for seven years, a deal that Vancouver mortgage planner Robert McLister said was not as good as the BMO offer despite providing two more years of rate certainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's no question in my mind that the five-year rate would work out better,” said Mr. McLister, editor of the Canadian Mortgage Trends blog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a different story with a 10-year mortgage for 3.99 per cent, which became available late last week from online bank ING Direct. According to the RateHub.ca website, 10-year rates as low as 3.84 per cent can be had through lenders working with mortgage brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 10-year mortgage at less than 4 per cent “creates a much more interesting conversation,” Mr. McLister said. Monster Mortgage's Mr. Gaetano said that when the cost of locking in for 10 years gets as cheap as it is now versus the five-year term, “you have to pounce on it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not too long ago, Mr. Gaetano was one of many experts who believed variable-rate mortgages were superior to all fixed-rate options. But while the banks have been highly competitive on fixed-rate mortgages lately, they've pretty much ruined the variable-rate option by cutting way back on discounting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can get a variable-rate mortgage today for 2.8 to 3 per cent at best, which is darn close to the cost of locking in for four or five years right now, and you've got zero rate certainty. Every time the prime rate rises in the next several years, so will your borrowing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The variable-rate party's over,” Mr. Gaetano said. “Those products are dinosaurs.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's get back to the housing market for a moment. The biggest support for prices right now are the low mortgage rates we've been talking about here. When rates rise, that support crumbles. Things could get ugly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why consider buying now? Because you can borrow money at 3.99 per cent or a bit less for 10 years. It's like freezing time at the exact best moment ever to finance the purchase of a house. If the price of your home declines, it's bound to be on the rise again a decade from now. Meanwhile, you'd have the chance to put a decade's worth of salary increases to work in ramping up your payments and making periodic lump-sum payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One hitch with 10-year mortgages is that you won't likely get the best rates from the big banks. Mr. Gaetano said the banks don't much like 10-year mortgages because they can't easily securitize them, which means packaging them up to sell to investors. That means you'll may need to visit a mortgage broker or check out ING Direct.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as economic necessity stares the provinces in the face, Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall is proposing an “innovation fund” for medicare, and Nova Scotia Premier Darrell Dexter says he won't have enough money to innovate because the seniors population is growing so quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wall and Mr. Dexter have it backward. Financial necessity is the best spur to innovation, not a slush fund labelled Innovation. But the premiers, even those who had seemed to welcome a unilateral federal funding plan, can't seem to focus on the next steps to building a more innovative, agile, cost-effective health-care system. Not to mention one of higher quality.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The provinces don't need to and shouldn't have to go to Ottawa for permission to innovate. The process would be time-consuming and distant from local concerns. In fact, the previous 10-year health accord overseen by Liberal prime minister Paul Martin was supposed to have bought $41-billion of innovation. It didn't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But financial necessity isn't something that anyone seems prepared for. The federal government promised to give 6 per cent a year in annual increases in health-care transfer payments for each of the next three years. After that, depending on economic growth, increases will be a minimum of 3 per cent a year, and possibly a fair bit more. The day of reckoning seems so far off that the provinces feel they can afford to use up the oxygen in the room, as Mr. Wall put it, on a variety of demands – whether an innovation fund or health transfers geared to the age of their population. (British Columbia Premier Christy Clark also wants age to be given its due.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wall says he took hope from a letter to the provinces from Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq. But Ms. Aglukkaq's letter talked about working together to make the health system more sustainable and accountable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ball (or perhaps the IV drip) is in the provinces' court, as Prime Minister Stephen Harper said On Monday. They should be using the available oxygen and time to find new ways to cut waiting lists, add electronic records, adapt family care, develop home care and so much more. An Innovation Fund is not the mother of invention. Necessity is.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We all know someone who's worn love goggles. They start dating someone new and their whole world starts revolving around that special someone who can do no wrong, even though everyone else seems to think otherwise. Once the honeymoon phase is over, the goggles come off, a dramatic breakup ensues and suddenly everything seems so clear. “Why didn't you guys say anything?” the friend asks.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meet Ben Rabidoux. He's a friend who has been trying to warn Canadians about the love affair we have with home ownership. Mr. Rabidoux is an analyst with M Hanson Advisers, a U.S. research firm that caters to institutional investors. His website, TheEconomicAnalyst.com, provides easy to digest graphs that essentially explain themselves, but he also weaves together a sobering new reality we may soon be facing. Already offended by the premise? He's used to it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are a few observations of hard data from his site:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1975, the average size of a house in Canada was 1,050 square feet. Fast forward to 2010 and new homes being built almost doubled to an average of 1,950 square feet. This increase in house size is accompanied by a decrease in the average number of people living in a household. In 1971, it was 3.5; by 2006, that number fell by a full person to 2.5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whereas in 1999 the price of a home was 3.2 times income, this had ballooned to 5.9 times income in 2010. Essentially, the amount of money we are willing to pay for a house has increased much faster than our incomes. Instead of buying beer we've switched to champagne, but we can still only afford beer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But wait, there's more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research suggests that people reach their spending peaks at age 46, then spending decreases as they start to pay off debts and save for retirement. The youngest boomers turned 46 last year. That means the pig in the python should be slowly moving from spending to saving for the next two decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that if Canadians approaching retirement age feel as though they haven't saved enough for retirement, they will likely turn to their fallback plan – downsizing their homes to free up cash. <span class="companylink">TD Canada Trust</span> recently released a survey indicating that only 43 per cent of boomers had a financial plan. Given the growth in housing prices and the rate of home ownership, it's very likely that this large population segment is going to have a considerable impact on supply and demand for real estate in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who resist the urge to keep up with the Joneses will be better off. While there might be selling pressure for the bigger homes as retirees downsize, they are downsizing into the more modest homes, which provides some buying pressure for smaller houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Add it all up, throw in the highest debt-to-income ratios in history for the average Canadian and the long-term prospect of interest rates rising and it's pretty easy to see why Mr. Rabidoux's website could become incredibly popular after the fact: He's trying to point out what the love goggles may be overlooking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's possible we could be looking at a two-speed housing market over the long term. Prices for larger homes may cool off as boomers downsize and smaller homes may benefit, which means moving to a house more within your means is more important than ever – just in case the Canadian love affair with real estate turns sour.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Al Gore's favourite word right now is “progressive.” He believes that the United States is, in general, becoming progressive. He believes that the tiny-but-growing all-news TV channel he co-founded, Current TV (which remains bizarrely unavailable on Canadian cable) is truly progressive. He says “progressive” a lot.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The former U.S. vice-president is sitting across the table from me and two other journalists in a tiny meeting room. I ask how he would define his role now – “political activist,” “climate-change campaigner,” “TV executive”? This amuses him. In answer, he says, “I'm just a recovering politician” and the truth of that is easy to see. He sits there, in what looks like an awkward position. His legs are splayed and he places both his hands on his left knee. Like a man waiting but alert, waiting to be called upon to go to the podium and make a speech.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's here to talk about Current TV, but also about the general state of TV news in the U.S. “We're the only independent TV news organization on the entire television platform,” he says of Current TV. “And this is important to note. The country is in trouble. The dialogue about democracy is broken.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's a bit steamed at the other all-news channels. Something that bugs him about CNN, Fox News and MSNBC is the treatment of every issue as one with a 50/50 opinion context.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What about the climate issue?” he says. “98 per cent of all the climate scientists in the world say that it's real. Every national academy of science, every professional scientific society says it's urgent. You gotta act. And then there are a couple of wackos who are on the payroll of large carbon polluters, so on TV it's a 50/50 issue. It's not a 50/50 issue, but both sides are given equal time.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also says that most all-news channel coverage is biased, not just politically, but because it aims to favour the rich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The dialogue that occurs on most of the other news networks is seriously tilted toward the top of the income ladder, the corporate point of view, the conglomerate view. Current TV isn't part of any conglomerate.” True, but this means Current TV remains small.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is in 63 million American home. (Fox News reaches 90 million, CNN, 100 million.) Current was founded by Gore and Joel Hyatt in 2005. Last summer, clearly with an eye on an upcoming election year, it began to reinvent and strengthen its coverage. It brought on board veteran CNN producer David Bohrman. It hired Keith Olbermann, the outspoken, left-ish MSNBC anchor and he brought his show called Countdown to Current. With a new show anchored by Cenk Uygur (famous in the U.S. for his long-running radio show The Young Turks) and a new nightly election-coverage program hosted by former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm, it aims to have impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It can only have a tiny influence but Gore says that Current is “a start-up” and, anyway, real impact and change is now coming from the fringes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have an illustration of how we think we have already brought something to prime-time television that nobody else has. When Occupy Wall Street began, nobody was covering it except Keith Olbermann, and night after night after night he hammered away on it, harangued the other networks, asking, ‘Why is nobody covering this?' Eventually they did. And now a few months later, the 99 per cent/1 per cent framework has become a key part of the political dialogue in America. You have Republican candidates in South Carolina accusing Mitt Romney of being a vulture capitalist. I never thought I'd live to see the day! The whole dialogue has changed. And what we bring that's different is a consistent, progressive point of view, politically direct and hard hitting.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's the “progressive” thing again. Gore is asked to explain what he means. “There's some polls that say X per cent are conservative, X per cent are liberal, X per cent are independent. When you dig deeper, what you find is that the one label that is used to self-describe people far more than any other in the U.S. today is ‘progressive.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think the country is getting tired of this ‘Borg' [a Star Trek reference to evil collectivists] of all-news channels putting out this right-of-centre agenda that keeps building the concentration of wealth at the top. The implicit agenda is eliminate the inheritance tax, cut taxes on the rich, don't worry about unemployment, even cut unemployment benefits,” Gore declares with passion in his voice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a good rant about American all-news channels but, I ask Gore, how can the news media, in general, get people to consume news and hear opinions that challenge pre-held beliefs? After all, anyone who reads a newspaper online is familiar with the daily onslaught of sneering from one partisan camp to another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“First of all, I'm not sure that media feedback sites are entirely representative of popular views,” Gore says. “Because I think there are organized efforts to influence them. You see the sameness in the comments. And I think the Internet culture, which is accused of ‘balkanizing' audiences into separate points of view actually serves to cross-pollinate views more than the Internet gets credit for. I don't believe that people are really self-segregating into ideological cul de sacs.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A conversation with Gore is a bit bizarre. He veers from political issues to opinion on news media. Asked about the negative advertising campaigns that have dominated the current Republican primaries race, he has an answer that could last for hours, if there was time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think that one of the reasons why politics in America has seemed to get crazier and crazier is that it's now dominated by big money,” he says with a sigh. “Of course, the Supreme Court, with whose opinions I've not always agreed, declared that corporations are people and that money is free speech. You all know this, but now you're seeing how it plays out with the casino billionaire dropping $5-million onto Newt Gingrich's so-called Super PAC. That's happening in a very pervasive way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And on TV you see all these candidates line up to deny science and say that up is down and black is white; it's because that helps them get more big money. When you see gridlock in the Congress where they're willing to put the credit rating of the United States at risk and when the Tea Party Republicans are willing to drive the country towards actual bankruptcy in order to avoid any slight increase in the tax rates paid by the wealthiest Americans, that's because that's where their campaign contributions come from. They are bought, lock, stock and barrel.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is put to him – is this issue ever really covered by Fox News, CNN or MSNBC? “These networks add some value,” he replies. “I don't want to be just critical of them, but I'm differentiating Current TV. We are politically direct. We do have a progressive point of view. It will be consistent 24/7.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end, of course, one can't help but ask for his take on current events, specifically the race to be the Republican candidate to challenge Barack Obama. His instant rely is this: “Romney is the probable, but in the course of winning will have created so many problems for himself that Obama is the probable winner. However, if the European economies collapse and the U.S. feels the brunt of the recession that ensues, then all bets are off.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the context of all-news TV in the U.S., I ask, is it all just TV entertainment? Gore thinks for about five seconds. “It's pretty crazy, I'll tell you,” he says. “The Republican race reminds me of a reality show where nobody gets voted off the island. How many times has a candidate been named a front-runner? I think seven times, at last count.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a good line. A recovering politician's line. In fact it's so good that, an hour later he repeats it, word-for-word, at a press conference. Then, inevitably, he told the press conference that Current TV is “progressive.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They used to be called the “dog days” of January – but no more.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In olden times – when there was far more disparity in team talent and team money, when victory meant two points to the winner and zero points to the loser – the NHL would be largely sorted out by midseason. If you were out of the playoffs, you were often too far out even to think about it. If you were in, there would still be some position juggling but hardly anything worth breaking a sweat over. Once the trading deadline passed the playoff-bound teams could get serious again and fine-tune themselves for the postseason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In modern times – three-point games, no ties, parity the pride of the NHL – you go to sleep in January at your peril.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heading into Monday's games, nine points separated first place from eighth, the final playoff position in the Western Conference. There were but five points between sixth place and 10th.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Eastern Conference, it was 10 points between first and eighth and only three points separating sixth place from ninth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This parity has a stressful effect on virtually every team throughout the season, but is most profoundly felt in January, when middle-rung teams begin assessing their prospects for the remainder of the hockey year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All the changes happen in February,” said Winnipeg Jets forward Kyle Wellwood, “so you want your team doing well.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wellwood's Jets had not been doing well of late. They had lost three in a row and were 1-5-0 in January when they arrived in the capital, earning but two points. The Senators, on the other hand, had gone 6-0-1 and gained 13 points. The two teams had virtually done a flip in the Eastern Conference standing, the Senators rising to fifth while the Jets had slipped down to 10th.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We want to put a stop to it before we get out of the [playoff] picture,” Jets forward Bryan Little said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It only takes one game to get out of a funk.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this one game, the Jets came out of it dramatically, defeating the Senators 2-0 on goals by Jim Slater and Tobias Enstrom. The Senators looked as listless as a team with a lock on the playoffs, which they do not have, while the Jets looked driven, despite the fact they were missing three key players.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were without defenceman Zach Bogosian, leading scorer Blake Wheeler and all-star selection Dustin Byfuglien.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was an unfortunate evening for Ottawa goaltender Craig Anderson, chosen No. 1 NHL star of the week earlier in the day. His teammates played as though he would also take care of the scoring, mounting but 11 shots at Winnipeg netminder Chris Mason over the first two periods and threatening only in the third, when they added 14 more for a total of 25.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mason played well for the shutout, but the real story was his team's determination to put an end to the skid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One victory, of course, does not cancel a funk, and the Jets are acutely aware that they are entering a critical pass in their season and must perform well or else suffer the fate of so many previous incarnations as the Atlanta Thrashers, a team that made the playoffs only once in 11 seasons and even then went out in four straight losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">January has too often been the month where all hope was lost for this franchise. Curious about this annual swoon, one of the Winnipeg reporters looked back over the 12 seasons of the Atlanta-Winnipeg franchise and discovered the Thrashers-Jets were playing 28 games under .500 in the month – and everyone in hockey knows that playing .500 hockey is no longer good enough in the era of three-point games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They need to play in 2012 as they played in 2011. “As I see them,” said Winnipeg head coach Claude Noel of the soaring Senators, “I see us in December.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only it is no longer December. It is halfway through January, with the critical decisions teams must make in February – trading deadline of Feb. 27 – coming fast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A time when both teams, Senators and Jets, if they do anything at all, hope to be looking to this year rather than next.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this very moment, I bet you're not thinking about deep-fried haggis wonton for dinner. But then, you're not Toddish McWong. That's the famous persona of Todd Wong, a 51-year-old Chinese-Canadian who works as a library assistant in Vancouver. His annual Gung Haggis Fat Choy dinner marks its 15th year next Sunday. An amalgam of traditions for Chinese New Year and Robbie Burns Night, the dinner is a celebration of Canadian multiculturalism that has grown in popularity every year. (There's a spin-off Gung Haggis Fat Choy dinner in Seattle and ambitions to roll them out across Canada.)</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It all began with a willingness to wear a kilt in the snow in 1993 at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, when Mr. Wong knew little of the Scottish bard's birthday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a phone conversation with The Globe and Mail from Vancouver, Mr. Wong takes up the tale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have read that you were a mature student at Simon Fraser University when you were asked to help out with the traditional Robbie Burns dinner. What was your first impression?I thought it was this weird ethnic tradition. They gave me a kilt to wear, the Fraser hunting tartan. And I was carrying the claymore [the Scottish version of a medieval long sword]. We walked around the cafeteria. There was a lonely piper. And the haggis tasted really weird. So I decided I would have some fun with it. I called myself Toddish McWong and thought it would make a good statement about multiculturalism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How did that change into an annual cross-cultural</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">celebration?Friends continued to call me Toddish McWong for years and tease me about it. And then in 1998, I discovered that Robbie Burns Day was two days away from Chinese New Year. So I decided to combine the two. I invited friends who were of Chinese and Scottish ancestry and I went to the library to read about how you do a Robbie Burns dinner. You have to read poetry. And at that point I brought in Chinese Canadian poetry, too. And then the next year, friends asked, ‘Will you do the dinner again?' It was so much work, we moved it to a restaurant. It has gotten bigger every year. Last year it was 439 people. It's not a fundraiser, exactly. But it increases awareness of non-profit groups that I work with. I'm president of Joy Kogawa House, vice-president of the Asian-Canadian Writers' Workshop and co-chair and founder of the Gung Haggis Fat Choy dragon boat team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's the meaning of the dinner's title?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a play on words. In Cantonese, Gung Hay Fat Choy is a traditional Chinese New Year greeting, wishing you prosperity and good health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You're fifth-generation Chinese-Canadian. Historically, the relationship between Anglo and Chinese cultures has been filled with tension. Were you making a comment on your own experience of being a visible minority?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was very aware of being on the outside, being called chink and other names, knowing I was non-white. I would say that I grew up with negative identity. There was a sense of being ashamed of being Chinese. And I was aware of racism in Vancouver itself, learning about the head tax and the exclusion act, which were basically passed by politicians who were of Scottish ancestry. There were some clashes between the cultures, particularly during the construction of the railroads and also in the mines. The history of British Columbia is not French and English as it is in Ontario and Quebec. I feel that it is truly Scottish and Chinese.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How much of your life has this multicultural tradition taken up?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has taken over my life. The preparation is all consuming. Throughout the year, if I see something that I think should be at the dinner, I'll bring it in. At the British Columbia Highland Games, I met a young fiddle player, Jocelyn Pettit. Her mother is Chinese-Canadian and her father is a French-Irish-Scottish-Canadian mixture. She's an incredible player so we featured her last year at the dinner. Every year, we add surprises. We're working on a version of setting Robbie Burns lyrics to Elvis Presley music. We've done rap versions of Address to a Haggis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Have there been cross-cultural food flops at this dinner?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One year we tried haggis wonton soup. It depends on how big you make the wonton, and that year they made it big. When you bit into it, it was way too haggisy. It almost made me gag. So we don't do that any more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What are the most popular dishes?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We serve haggis, traditional-style, for the purists and we also serve it as traditional Chinese lettuce wrap. People are encouraged to take the lettuce, put some Chinese barbecue sauce in it and to take a spoonful of haggis and mix it with that. It's very popular. So are haggis spring rolls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are you thinking of doing more cross-cultural dinners?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm thinking that St. Patrick's Day would be great for Persian New Year [which usually occurs around March 21]. And last year, we did a special dinner with [CBC's] Shelagh Rogers and called it Gung Haggis Fat Choy Pow Wow Dinner because we included aboriginal traditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are you more comfortable in a kilt now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh yes. I own seven. I probably wear a kilt at least three times a month. We have kilts night at a local pub. If you wear your kilt, you get a free pint of Guinness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do you ever get purists who say your dinner tradition muddies the two cultures?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the contrary. People say it's more Canadian when you're mixing things up.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why would a woman pay a considerable sum of money to have a surgeon cut open her body and implant globs of plastic filled with chemicals?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you get right down to it, isn't it just another form of female genital mutilation?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those are a couple of the questions asked by Marianne Mollman of Amnesty International in a provocative new essay published by The Huffington Post.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, conditions are far more sanitary at Western plastic-surgery clinics where women's breasts are sliced and “enhanced” than in dirt-poor villages in the developing world where girls and young women have their clitorises and labia excised ritualistically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, breast augmentation is done voluntarily, but so is much female genital mutilation. Both practices are driven by ingrained notions of a woman's place in society, the quest for an ideal of beauty/sexuality and social/religious norms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Isn't the outcome ultimately the same, Ms. Mollman asks: Surgery with no discernible health benefits (and many potential health risks), a negative impact on a woman's sexual health, and permanent scars, physical and psychological?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obviously, the mutilation of girls and women with rusty razors is a far greater horror, a human-rights violation on a grand scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the rhetorical comparisons do serve a useful purpose. They should lead us to wonder why Western society is so enamoured of large breasts. The comparisons should serve too, to remind us that breast augmentation surgery is not as banal as we tend to make it out to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That point is driven home by the current scandal unfolding from Australia to Uruguay. (It does not directly affect the Canada or United States.) The French company <span class="companylink">Poly Implant Prothèse</span> sold about 400,000 implants between 1991 and 2011, when it declared financial bankruptcy. But the current problem had its roots much earlier. The company allegedly, in a bid to cut costs, removed one protective layer from the product and used industrial-grade silicone (used in mattresses) in its implants instead of medical-grade silicone. Just as concerning as the company's actions was the failure of regulators to catch the gross, decades-long violations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are fears that, due to the cutting of corners, the PIP implants are more likely to leak and raise a woman's risk of cancer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Countries and individuals are now scrambling to figure out what to do. Is it best to remove the implants or leave them in place? If they are to be removed, who will pay – the private clinics that implanted them, the state, or women themselves?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Breast augmentation has a long, sordid history. In her book Inventing Beauty, Teresa Riordan notes that women have used a seemingly endless variety of contraptions to enhance their bosoms since the 18th century: bustiers, falsies, wire devices, suction machines, creams, injections of paraffin wax, animal fat and so on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the early 1960s, technological advances led to a switch from glass bottles to plastic bags for the storage of blood for transfusion. One day, a physician carrying a bag of blood noted that it felt like fondling a breast. His colleague, Thomas Cronin, had a classic Eureka moment. He created the first breast implants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The product took off, interest fuelled by buxom Hollywood stars, and the relaxing of sexual mores that made publications like Playboy and “entertainment” venues like strip clubs more popular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Breast implants were not regulated until 1976, when researchers began to worry about risks of cancer. In 1980, CBC-TV ran one of the first exposés. Later, Montreal Gazette reporter Nicholas Regush exposed the Même breast implants scandal, showing that polyurethane foam degraded in women's bodies, causing health problems, and that Health Canada failed to act on the danger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar issues arose around the world. In 1992 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention essentially banned the cosmetic use of implants. (They could still be used for reconstructive surgery for breast-cancer survivors and for men undergoing sex changes.) The hiatus lasted until 1999 when the Institute of Medicine released an exhaustive report concluding implants did not cause any systemic disease. However, the report noted that the surgery can lead to serious infections, to loss of nipple sensation and to capsular contraction, which can leave the enhanced breast rock-hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moratorium was lifted contingent on manufacturers doing large, postmarket research studies that track the health outcomes of at least 40,000 women over a decade or more. We still don't have the results but, despite the scandals and the health concerns, implants are selling more than ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, an estimated 10 million women worldwide have breast implants, and it is one of the most common cosmetic surgeries procedure on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, breast implants have become normalized: It has become, in our consumerist society, natural to look unnatural.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should our outrage be limited to the fact that a manufacturer used mattress-grade silicone rather than so-called medical-grade silicone? Shouldn't we be more concerned about the fundamental acceptability – and ethics – of sewing plastic bags into women's breasts to “enhance” them, regardless of the material used being silicone, saline or foam?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should we glibly accept the mutilation (or self-mutilation if you prefer) as normal? And, if so, are we not tacitly accepting the mutilation of women's genitals more generally?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barbarism remains barbarism, even when it is regulated, and even when it is sugar-coated (or plastic-coated and sterilized).</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you want to lower your risk of stroke, there's a mineral you need to pay more attention to. According to a review of seven international studies, people who eat plenty of magnesium-rich foods – leafy greens, beans, lentils, nuts and whole grains – are significantly less likely to have a stroke.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, many Canadians in all age categories don't get enough magnesium. More than 50 per cent of adults, aged 51 and older, consume too little. An even greater proportion of Canadians fail to meet daily requirements after age 70, when the risk of stroke is greatest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's estimated there are 50,000 strokes in Canada each year, about one stroke every 10 minutes. The majority – 80 per cent – are ischemic strokes caused when a blood clot interrupts blood flow to the brain. Hemorrhagic strokes, caused by uncontrolled bleeding in the brain, account for the remaining 20 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Risk factors for stroke include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, excess alcohol, overweight and stress. The prevalence of stroke also increases with age; after 55, the risk doubles every 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysis, to be published in the February issue of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, combined the results of seven studies published in the past 14 years in the United States, Europe and Asia. Researchers tracked how much magnesium people consumed and how many had a stroke over an 11- to 12-year period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average daily magnesium intake of study participants was less than recommended. (In Canada and the United States, men and women over 30 need 420 and 320 milligrams of magnesium respectively each day.) For every extra 100 milligrams of magnesium people consumed each day above the average intake (roughly 200 milligrams), the risk of having any type of stroke fell by 8 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A higher magnesium intake prevented ischemic stroke but did not significantly lower the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Every 100 milligram increase of magnesium above the average was linked with a 9 per cent reduced risk of ischemic stroke. In other words, people who consumed 400 milligrams of magnesium a day were 16 per cent less likely to have a stroke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Magnesium is thought to guard against stroke through its influence over risk factors. The mineral is needed to maintain healthy blood pressure. A 2006 review of 12 randomized trials showed that magnesium supplementation lowered elevated blood pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar (glucose) by influencing the release and activity of insulin, the hormone that clears sugar from the bloodstream. A 2010 study reported that among 4,500 adults, those who consumed the most magnesium – 400 milligrams for every 2,000 calories – were 47 per cent less likely to develop Type 2 diabetes over the 20 year follow-up compared with those whose diets provided only half as much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher magnesium intakes have also been linked with lower levels of inflammation, a risk factor for diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's another reason to be mindful of your magnesium in- take. A higher magnesium diet is also associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer, particularly in men. Magnesium may work to ward off colon cancer by minimizing free radical damage, reducing the proliferation of colon cells and improving how the body uses insulin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the best food sources of magnesium include black beans, chickpeas, kidney beans, navy beans, soybeans, firm tofu, spinach, Swiss chard, halibut, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, yogurt and wheat germ.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increase your intake of magnesium-rich foods before reaching for a supplement. These foods are also rich in fibre, folate and potassium, and low in sodium, attributes that may also play a role in keeping you healthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you need to bridge the gap in your diet, supplements made from magnesium citrate are available in 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 milligram doses. Do not take more than 350 milligrams a day from a supplement; higher intakes of supplemental magnesium can cause diarrhea.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Associate law professor at Queen's University</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of the Attawapiskat furor, the Harper government is offering what it claims is a tool for stimulating economic activity and generating wealth on reserves: the First Nations Property Ownership Initiative.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The argument for FNPO is that first nations people are at an economic disadvantage because property on reserves is held either collectively or privately but with too many strings attached. There would be more economic development on reserves if aboriginal people had ready access to the sort of “no strings attached” private property that most people have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the situation's a lot more complicated. The arguments proponents marshal in favour of FNPO don't support the program they're proposing. They point to the economic lift some developing countries have experienced after formalizing “informal” squatters' rights: Owners invest more in their property, and credit markets open up when their property rights are secure. But this isn't what FNPO offers. First nations people already have formal private property rights; it's just that they hold land by way of certificates of possession or leases instead of “no strings attached” ownership. So the advantages of formalization aren't on the table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real advantage of “no strings attached” ownership in reserve lands (which FNPO offers) is that it will attract non-aboriginal investors who may be reluctant to subject themselves to regulation by first nations. So it's probably true that FNPO will draw some new outside investors. This, however, will come at a significant cost to the ability of first nations to govern themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, “no strings attached” ownership deprives aboriginal people of one of the few tools they have for self-government. The long-term lease operates as a kind of regulatory and land-planning device. When aboriginal peoples grant leases to their reserve lands, they're able to impose obligations of good management directly on leaseholders. This option is simply not available with “no strings attached” ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, because leases are always time-limited, they preserve a land base for first nations for when their full powers of self-government are recognized. In the U.S., the Dawes Act of 1887 privatized property on reserves. In many places, reserve lands were bought up by non-aboriginal owners, leaving tribes such as the Oneida Nation without a significant land base. Today, the Oneida are still struggling to reassemble their territory, antagonizing many non-natives living in their midst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FNPO proponents may point to the voluntary nature of the program. It doesn't force first nations to do anything; it simply offers an easy way to create “no strings attached” ownership on reserves. True. But what's most important is what's not on offer: serious efforts to resolve questions of aboriginal self-government. Introducing “no strings attached” private property before self-government issues are settled is likely to create new “facts on the ground” and new political challenges for future negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If private property rights are important for economic growth on reserves, as the Harper government claims, then it's all that much more important to agree now on aboriginal powers of self-government. The Nisga'a Nation is a model in this regard: They're introducing a series of private property reforms – against the backdrop of clearly defined powers of self-government recognized in their historic final agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Harper government's initiative, in effect, treats self-government as a “luxury good” – something aboriginal people can only afford after “basics” such as private property rights and free markets are in place. By that time, it may be too late.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The notion that sex selection – selective abortion of fetuses of female gender – is being practised in some ethnic communities in Canada comes as a shock to many.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response, Rajendra Kale, interim editor of the Canadian Medical Association Journal, has called for a ban on disclosing the sex of a fetus until 30 weeks, at which point it is difficult to obtain an abortion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While well-intentioned, the proposal is impractical, unethical, and fails to address the root problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Female fetuses are being aborted because, in some cultures, girls are not valued; the birth of a girl is considered a financial burden because she has few prospects of a good income, and a dowry can drain a family's finances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The solution to that problem is not criminalizing ultrasounds and amniocentesis, nor is it withholding medical information from women, practices that would be patronizing and unethical. Besides, how would you enforce a law like banning the disclosure of the sex of a fetus?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A universal ban would be unnecessarily broad as sex selection is practised only among a small minority of Asian immigrants. And, if you try to apply the new rules only to select communities, well, that's at best racial stereotyping and, in effect, offensively racist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, there is evidence showing pretty convincingly that sex selection is practised by some Canadians of Sikh, Hindu and Chinese descent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are also Canadians of all religions and races who practise other forms of “family balancing.” Couples who have a girl and want a boy, or have two boys and want a girl. So they choose to abort a fetus and try again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You may disagree or feel uncomfortable with the practice but people who practise family balancing are not evil or nefarious,” said Tim Caulfield, the Canada Research Chair in Health Law and Policy at the University of Alberta in Edmonton. He stressed that he is not endorsing sex selection, just underscoring that it is a complex issue with many nuances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After decades of pitched battles, Canada effectively has no abortion law. It is a medical procedure that, like others, depends on the ethical practice of medicine. The last thing we need is to have women who are making an already-difficult choice, to be grilled about why they are having an abortion.India, where the practice of sex selection is much more widespread and problematic than in Canada, has had a law in place since 1994 that bans medical professionals from disclosing the sex of a fetus. “There's quite a debate about whether it works. There are a lot of loopholes,” said Anant Bhan, a physician and bioethicist at the Sandra Rotman Centre at the University of Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Bhan said the solution ultimately is to eradicate the systematic neglect of girls and women that exists in large parts of the world “but that kind of profound societal change is not going to occur overnight.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, you need a whole host of approaches. You need education – and, above all, you need to allow girls to get an education, which opens up economic opportunities. You need to make practices like dowries socially unacceptable. And you need to continue to publish data like the CMAJ has done, drawing attention to these practices so they can be discussed openly, not practised furtively. We're not going to legislate our way out of this problem.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sophisticated early warning systems forecast a drought and a hunger crisis in Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia as far back as the summer of 2010; but donors, governments, the United Nations and even relief agencies failed to respond until people began to die.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the months before the famine, the world was understandably preoccupied with the global recession, the Arab Spring uprisings and other crises. However, the early warning system, which analyzes weather, agriculture, livestock, markets and nutrition, produced reliable information that should not have been ignored.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wait-and-see approach resulted in the unnecessary deaths of 100,000 people – many of them Somali women and children. In all, more than 13 million people have been affected. Tens of millions of extra dollars had to be spent to bring in food and water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The malnutrition rates in Somalia were already above the emergency threshold in August, 2010, so the early warning system captured the reality. It just didn't trigger the right reaction,” notes Robert Fox, the executive director of Oxfam Canada. This organization, along with Save the Children, just released a report calling on governments, donors and relief agencies to prevent a recurrence of the Horn of Africa disaster by changing the way they respond to food emergencies. Aid funding should be more flexible and agile. Development initiatives must be temporarily postponed if emergency relief is needed. The technical capacity should be in place to scale up aid operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report is well-timed. In the Sahel belt of North Africa, another imminent food crisis is unfolding, due to drought and high food prices in Chad, Mali and Senegal. Malnutrition rates are approaching emergency thresholds, and aid groups say there is a window of opportunity between now and March to assist vulnerable communities. The world has a chance to put the lessons from East Africa into practice. It would be a crime to fail again.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With softer tannins than cabernet sauvignon and syrah, carménère is proving a compelling constituent in new, quintessentially Chilean blends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Chile's shipments to Canada recently fell behind those of its value-oriented South American neighbour, Argentina – the latter with its crowd-pleasingly chunky malbecs – there are signs of a turnaround as consumers discover newly available premium brands and higher-quality offerings from established producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 12 months ending this past November, Chile and</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Argentina represented 5.3 per cent and 5.4 per cent, respectively, of wine volume sold in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in that period Argentina declined 8.1 per cent compared with a gain of 6 per cent for Chile. If the trend continues, Chile will be ahead of its neighbour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Consumers are coming to Chile for higher-priced, $15-plus alternatives, and we have the quality to attract them and keep them,” says Javier Santos, Canadian country director for Marnier-Lapostolle, which produces the excellent Lapostolle brand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You'll find that quality reflected in the following offerings, available in the provinces indicated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luis Felipe Edwards Dona Bernarda 2007</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Score: 91 Price: $35.99 at B.C. private stores only</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Named after founder Luis Felipe Edwards's wife, whose face graces the label, this red is based mainly on cabernet, blended in most years with carménère, syrah and petit verdot. Big and juicy, it offers a core of pure cherry and cassis coated in fine-grained tannins. Match it with steak or cellar it for up to 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coyam Emiliana 2007</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Score: 92 Price: $29.99 in B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country's creative blending skills are evident in this uncommon union of syrah, cabernet sauvignon, carménère, merlot, petit verdot and mourvedre. It's as though Bordeaux had merged with the northern and southern Rhône valleys. Big-bodied yet balanced, this red shows notes of blackberry, currant, vanilla and toasty oak, seasoned with a dusting of herbs. Perfect for roast beef. It should improve with 10 to 15 years in the cellar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undurraga Altazor 2007</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Score: 91 Price: $49.99 at B.C. private stores only</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard to guess the grape constituents here – the mark of another offbeat and intriguing blend. For the record, they are: cabernet sauvignon, syrah, carménère and merlot. This concentrated red serves up loads of dark-skinned fruit, bitter chocolate and soothing eucalyptus, and it begs to share a table with rack of lamb or prime rib.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carmen Gran Reserva Carménère 2009</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Score: 90 Price: $21.99 in B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An opulent carménère, oozing superripe, prune-like fruit, with added nuances of vanilla and coffee, it would make fast friends with barbecued ribs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cousino-Macul Antiguas Reservas Cabernet Sauvignon 2009</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Score: 90 Price: $15.50 in Ont., $21.99 in B.C., $18.25 in Que.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the sort of home run that has been drawing exacting consumers to Chile's mid-range (yet still attractively priced) wines. Full-bodied and succulent, with a sweet explosion of cherry and cassis flavours, it carries through with chocolate, fine-grained tannins and a dry finish. Medium-rare steak would pair beautifully.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Santa Rita Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon 2009</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Score: 89 Price: $13.95 in Ont., $15.99 in B.C., $15.10 in Que.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A long-standing favourite of bargain hunters, this full-bodied red continues to deliver impressive value. Textbook cabernet flavours of cassis and black olive are joined by chocolate, charred oak and invigorating mint. It would mingle gloriously with steak. And, remarkable for a wine at this price, it could improve with up to eight years in the cellar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Montes Alpha Syrah 2009</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Score: 89 Price: $19.95 in Ont., $23.55 in Que.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A ripe, full-bodied red with flavours of plum, chocolate and black pepper, it's built on a spine of solid acidity and smooth tannins. Think of northern Rhône syrah – with more opulent, sunny fruit. Try it with hearty red-meat stews.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Light medium-bodied, this red delivers recognizable pinot flavour, unlike most pinots at its price.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The difference in the Ottawa Senators from last season to this one was noticeable in two places Tuesday night.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One was on the ice at the Air Canada Centre, where the Senators stole a game they had no business winning. They were a tired team heading into their meeting with the Toronto Maple Leafs, having lost at home the night before to the Winnipeg Jets, which interrupted a hot streak that began after the Christmas break.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Somehow, though, the Senators hung in there, with goaltender Craig Anderson stepping forward as they were outshot 31-15 over the first 40 minutes. Then Kyle Turris scored early in the third to give the Senators a 3-2 win and terrific start on their six-game trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which brings us to the second difference with the Senators this season – behind the bench. New head coach Paul MacLean is clearly someone the Senators want to play for, as noted by the rejuvenated Jason Spezza before the game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spezza was answering a question about how he was able to bounce back (he scored his 20th goal of the season in the second period) after two mediocre seasons of 57 points each that mirrored the decline of the Senators and he went out of his way to give much of the credit to MacLean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We've got a real good coach,” Spezza said, and then added: MacLean “has put me in a good position to succeed.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MacLean, 53, has done that with everybody on the Senators roster in his first season as an NHL head coach after 10 years as an assistant with the Anaheim Ducks and Detroit Red Wings. With the Senators sitting in fifth place in the Eastern Conference after no one gave them much of a chance to finish within hailing distance of the playoffs, MacLean is now in the conversation with John Tortorella of the New York Rangers, Kevin Dineen of the Florida Panthers and Ken Hitchcock of the St. Louis Blues when it comes to candidates for NHL's coach-of-the-year award.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key, according to Spezza, and MacLean himself when he was pressed into describing himself as a coach, is communication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also doesn't hurt that two of MacLean's assistants, Dave Cameron and Mark Reeds, were successful junior head coaches, since the Senators restocked their lineup last summer with youngsters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think from Day 1 in camp we knew how Mac was going to coach, what he wanted from us, what type of team we'd be,” Spezza said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We've really bought in to how he wants us to play and it's just a matter of maintaining that – a high-tempo game, try to be physical and try to involve everyone in the lineup.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting players to buy in is the biggest challenge of any NHL head coach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MacLean managed it quickly because he learned about the importance of communication through his many years as an NHL player and assistant coach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senators insiders will also tell you the players were quick to buy MacLean's program because his predecessor, Cory Clouston, was a remote figure to the players who did not see the need to communicate much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Red Wings coach Mike Babcock predicted before the season that his former assistant would be a success in Ottawa because he understood the need to communicate with the players.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike junior hockey, you can't scare NHL players, Babcock said, “so you've got to be a better communicator. You have to be able to talk to people and build relationships.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MacLean said he is still learning on the job and he certainly doesn't consider himself a taskmaster. But he wants his players to understand just what they are supposed to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I like to communicate,” MacLean said, “and I like people to understand what my expectations are and not have any grey areas. I'm not sure I'm demanding but I certainly have expectations and I expect them to be met.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a 9-2-1 record since Christmas under their belts, the Senators can say they understand and they are meeting – no, exceeding – expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BY THE NUMBERS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">18</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additional points the Ottawa Senators have over last season, as of Jan. 18. The Sens were in 13th place in the Eastern Conference on that date in 2011 with just 40 points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The absence of Captain Francesco Schettino from his damaged ship, the Costa Concordia, while some of the passengers were still on board – as documented by his recorded dialogue with Gregorio Maria de Falco, the coast-guard commander at the city of Livorno – invites an inference of cowardice. Capt. Schettino offered as an excuse that the ship was at an angle; Commander de Falco replied with an obscenity, “Get on board, cazzo!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capt. Schettino seemed untroubled by being on one of the rescue boats, rather than on his ship. It was reminiscent of a Gilbert and Sullivan character, the Duke of Plaza Toro, who “led his regiment from behind – / He found it less exciting./ But when away his regiment ran,/ His place was at the fore, O …”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retreat is not in itself a proof of cowardice; great generals from Xenophon to Wellington have led skillful withdrawals. But it was not Napoleon Bonaparte's finest hour, when in December, 1812, he disguised himself as a Pole and set out for Paris, leaving his army behind, to trudge through the Russian snows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The captain of the Costa Concordia could well look for an engaging, likeable defender in Sir John Falstaff, who once said, “Thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules, but beware instinct. …. Instinct is a great matter. I was [just] now a coward on instinct. I shall think the better of myself….” Later, more definitively, Falstaff said, “Discretion is the better part of valour.” In other words, cowardice is prudence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, cowardice is as old as humanity. In Homer's Iliad, when a single combat between Paris and Menelaus might have ended the Trojan War, Paris puts up no resistance as the sex goddess Aphrodite picks him up and carries him off the battlefield in a mist. In the Odyssey, a minstrel and a herald show abject fear, the former begging for mercy at Odysseus' knees, the latter hidingunder a chair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dante Alighieri presents fence-sitting neutrality as cowardice – viltà or vileness; his Divina Commedia reserves a dark area just outside the gates of Hell for the angels who took no side when Lucifer and his followers rebelled against God.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The passive Capt. Schettino was bothered by the darkness, too; Cdr. de Falco was incredulous: “It's dark, and you want to go home?… Get on board, b-o-a-r-d!”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JERUSALEM -- Recent media focus on the segregation of women on buses passing through ultra-Orthodox neighbourhoods and other outrages against women in the public space has created the perception that Israeli democracy is under imminent threat by religious fundamentalism. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went so far as to warn a recent gathering of Israeli and American policy-makers in Washington that Israel was becoming more like Iran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, that perception obscures a far more complicated reality. For all the fears here of an unstoppable fundamentalist onslaught against Israeli modernity, ultra-Orthodoxy itself is in deep crisis – a crisis created, in part, by its astonishing success.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the years after the Holocaust, which destroyed the centres of Jewish religious life in Eastern Europe, ultra-Orthodoxy was widely eulogized as a fading remnant. Yet, with heroic persistence, the remnant rebuilt its communal life. Today, the ultra-Orthodox – known as Haredim, those who fear God – are about 10 per cent of Israeli society, with the country's highest birth rate. Some demographers predict that, if current trends continue, Haredim could reach 30 per cent of the population within 50 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most Haredi young men don't work or serve in the military – mandatory for other young Israeli men – but devote themselves to religious study, supported by their wives and state subsidies. Historically, there has never been a Jewish community wholly centred around full-time Torah study. Indeed, Jewish tradition is replete with warnings against Torah scholars avoiding employment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an initial response to the Holocaust, the Haredi violation of that ethos was perhaps understandable. But Israeli society can no longer afford to subsidize the massive Haredi exclusion from the work force or the military.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real threat to Israeli society comes not from the acts of Haredi extremists but from the distorted relationship of the Haredi community to the state. Haredim not only exclude themselves from the responsibilities of Israeli citizenship but demand that the mainstream subsidize their separatism. Thanks to Israel's dysfunctional coalition system, Haredi parties have been able to extract wholesale draft deferments for their young men and vast subsidies for their institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with the economic strains of recent years, government subsidies are declining and increasing numbers of Haredi young men are joining the work force; some are even joining the military. The Haredi community is hardly monolithic, and is divided by its attitudes toward the secular state. It is, in part, the growing involvement of some Haredim in mainstream Israeli society that has led to an extremist backlash among others. This new wave of fanaticism isn't a sign of self-confidence but of desperation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first steps now being taken toward integrating Haredim into the work force and the military need to be intensified. That depends in large part on the major political parties joining together to change the current coalition system, which allows minority parties to force their will on the majority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of all, it depends on the Israeli mainstream's reclaiming its ideological self-confidence. Haredi leaders depict their community as the repository of Jewish values, and the rest of the country as lost in hedonistic temptation. In fact, modern Israelis are no less committed than Haredim to a vision of an authentic Jewish life. Their Zionist and democratic values have created a state capable of defending Jewish interests and of drawing immigrants from radically different backgrounds back into a single Jewish people, nurtured by a vital Hebrew culture. The response of the Jewish mainstream to the Holocaust wasn't a retreat into self-ghettoization but rejoining the community of nations as a self-confident Jewish collective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Haredi community has been at best indifferent, and often hostile, to those historic achievements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Haredim are an idealistic community whose members often live in voluntary poverty for the sake of their faith. They have created an extraordinary network of educational and charitable institutions. Their spiritual challenge to other Jews is to live one's Judaism with greater commitment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The secular socialist founders of the state were largely indifferent or hostile to religion. And so a generation of non-Orthodox Israelis was raised largely ignorant of Judaism. The result was a further empowering of the Orthodox and especially the ultra-Orthodox, who became, by default, the guardians of the faith. While Zionism freed the Jewish people, Judaism remained in the ghetto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that is beginning to change. Increasing numbers of Israelis are taking responsibility for their Judaism. Non-Orthodox prayer and religious study groups are spreading. Israeli artists, especially musicians, are drawing on Jewish tradition for inspiration. For the first time, new forms of non-Orthodox Israeli Judaism are emerging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The non-Haredi Orthodox community, known as religious Zionists, has a crucial role to play, too. Although some religious Zionists have become increasingly extreme in their religious practice, most want to remain part of the mainstream. At a recent rally against religious extremism in the town of Beit Shemesh, most protesters were moderate Orthodox Jews.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In reclaiming its Jewish confidence and its political will, the Israeli mainstream can begin to transform its unbalanced relationship with the Haredi community. The good news is that growing numbers of Israelis are angry enough to fight for the changes on which the future viability of the Jewish state may depend.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If I could sit on my cheese drawer to close it I would. Over the holidays it became so crammed that I established overflow areas throughout the fridge for all the leftover bits and pieces – which are now discovered only by chance like coins in the couch cushions.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wish I could blame this build-up on holiday entertaining, but the truth is these little gems accumulate every couple of months and need to be used. I know that I could melt them into a soup or grate them into a salad, but that would mean peeling veggies or washing lettuce leaves and still only using one measly cheese scrap at a time. I need to do away with these in one blow, and for the laziest, yet chicest solution, I turn to the French and a recipe they call fromage fort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fromage fort, in essence, is just a fancy cheese ball with a great PR team. The French take all their odds and ends (goat cheese, brie, blue, gruyère etc.) and combine them with wine and seasoning to create a piq-uant spread. The robust flavour (implicit in the name) comes from the variety of cheeses used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This French tradition will change your cheese drawer for the better. You will still hoard cheese fragments but henceforth with smug purpose knowing you will always be able to “whip something up” no matter how unexpected the guests or how bare the pantry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fromage fort</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no real recipe to this spread as it will be different each time, but here is a guideline. It makes just over a cup of spread.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ingredients</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">500 g cheese bits</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 clove garlic, peeled</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2 tablespoons fresh herbs (optional)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 tablespoon unsalted butter (optional – your cheeses may be creamy enough)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generous grind fresh ground pepper</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1/4 to 1/3 cup dry white wine</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Salt (to taste)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Method</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remove rinds and mouldy bits from your cheese. Grate firm cheeses and roughly cube anything else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throw everything but the wine and salt into the food processor and buzz until just combined. Add the wine a little at a time until the spread reaches the desired consistency. Taste and add salt if needed (most cheese are already quite savoury).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blue cheese (or any strong cheese) will quickly become dominant; I used one-quarter Stilton in one version and the fromage fort maintained a good bite. If you are serving this heated (on baguette, for example), the flavour will be mellower than when served cold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can also add vegetable broth, beer or even cream as your liquid (FYI, red wine will turn this a greyish, unappetizing colour). Add lemon juice for acidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Serve at room temperature with veggies and crackers, or spread on toasted baguette and throw under the broiler until the cheese is browning (two to three minutes). Fromage fort also makes a great gourmet grilled cheese sandwich. (I like it on dark rye with crispy, sliced radishes on the side.)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First ministers meetings have fallen out of favour to the point of disappearance. Jean Chrétien hated them; so, apparently, does Stephen Harper. This week's premiers meetings show why.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What prime minister would want to sit with a bunch of caterwauling premiers, who can't agree on anything except more federal cash and periodic studies of possible future collaboration, such as the one announced Tuesday for an “innovation fund”?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health care has always been largely a provincial matter, and the provinces have always wanted to keep it that way. Meeting together, there are plenty of issues for the premiers to discuss about how to better co-operate, as in a common drug formulary, bulk purchasing of drugs, impediments to portability, interprovincial labour deals, common clinical assessments and so on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, no, gathered together, they just can't resist bashing the federal piñata, hoping it will release more money. Mr. Harper has already agreed to give transfers to the provinces indexed at 6 per cent for the next five years, falling to the range of 4 per cent thereafter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This federal offer comes when Ottawa has a large deficit and is preparing to cut its own programs by 5 per cent to 10 per cent. Moreover, no other government program, federal or provincial, is being indexed at anything remotely like 6 per cent. When Paul Martin hiked transfers and indexed them at 6 per cent, Ottawa enjoyed a tidy surplus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premiers don't seem to have noticed that things have changed. They're dreaming up new reasons why the 6 per cent should not be continued sine die. You can see why they want to deflect attention from the challenge they don't want to speak frankly to their citizens about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health-care costs rose at an annual rate of 6.5 per cent in the 2000-2009 period. Premiers are scared stiff of the hard decisions that lie ahead to bring the increases down to something more affordable, especially since the next decade will almost certainly feature slower economic growth than the decade before the 2008 recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every province faces challenges. B.C. Premier Christy Clark says her province should get more money because B.C. has more seniors per capita who cost the health-care system more. The Atlantic provinces have the same problem, although the aging of the overall national population will add only about 1 per cent to the total health bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newfoundland and Labrador has widely scattered outports to service, and that's expensive. Ontario has all those newcomers, and Alberta and Saskatchewan have growing populations. Quebec is Quebec, complaining about needing more money, as always.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec Premier Jean Charest is up in arms that Ottawa decided unilaterally not to hand over even more cash. Heaven forbid, however, that Ottawa should tie anything to the money it's offering, let alone anything additional. Health care is provincial territory, so Ottawa should pay up and butt out, which is pretty much what Mr. Harper proposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Martin signed his deal with the premiers in 2003-2004, a bunch of gossamer strings were attached to the money. Quebec respected none of them. It had decided not to participate in the Common Drug Review, squelched being part of the Canada Health Council, the common wait times reduction strategy, the national pharmaceuticals strategy, all in the name of its attitude toward Ottawa of pay up but butt out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the premiers wanted to fix something, they could get Quebec to change the clauses in its provincial drug plan that penalizes any company that negotiates a lower-cost deal with another province. This clause cripples smaller provinces trying to get lower drug prices, forcing them into “secret” rebate deals and other subterfuges with companies. Quebec has the highest drug costs in the country, because it wishes to protect brand-name pharmaceutical companies located in the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any event, Quebec is not the only province that wants jurisdiction over health, as much federal cash (and tax points) as possible, but no federal say in how the money is spent. No wonder Mr. Harper wants no part of such conversations.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best. Interest. Rates. Ever.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> has given to borrowers. Oh, maybe rates were lower at some point in our distant past, but people back then were amateurs at spending money. Today, we have mega-low rates and a consumer society that pops out a new thing to buy every 20 seconds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So let's take a (tongue-in-cheek) look at the rationale for borrowing today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First off, it has to be said that it's good business to borrow now. If your household were a well-run corporation, your chief financial officer would be arguing strongly for using low-cost debt to pay for major capital expenditures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can now finance the cost of a house at just below 4 per cent for 10 years. Great deal. Five-year mortgages come as low as 2.99 per cent. Unbelievable. Expect to pay 3.5 per cent if you set up a home equity line of credit, which is the Gumby of loans. So flexible – you can just pay interest every month if you want and you can delay full repayment indefinitely. Best. Interest. Rates. Ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span>, master of the economy, actually wants you to borrow. That's why the central bank's benchmark lending rate has been at today's low level since September, 2010. The global economic system hasn't been its old self for years now and low rates are the standard tool for turning things around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe you've heard those warnings from Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney that today's debts could become unmanageable when interest rates rise. It's true that interest rates are miles – sorry, kilometres – below their historical averages. The central bank's benchmark rate could quadruple and still be in line with what we saw in 2006 through early 2008. Old timers in the mortgage business say it wasn't that long ago that paying 5 per cent for five years was considered a great deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's fine, but we've been warned about rate increases since back in 2009 and we're no closer to them now than we were back then. Brace yourself for higher rates? That's like worrying about bad traffic on Yonge Street when the Toronto Maple Leafs win the Stanley Cup. Manana, baby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowing money is almost your patriotic duty. Be proud you can help spend the country out of danger. The Americans and Greeks tried it, but we're actually doing it. Borrow today and keep our home builders building so they can contribute to the economy. Keep the car dealers dealing. If we stop buying, we stop growing as a country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, savers are a bit testy about the low rates that are so great for borrowers. You can't blame them when it's a home run to get a 2-per-cent rate of return from a high-rate savings account, and 3.5 per cent from a five-year guaranteed investment certificate. But what did a high savings rate ever do for a country beyond encouraging fusty old habits like balancing your household budget and living within your means?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think also of the personal gratification you get from borrowing. Salaries have been going nowhere for a few years now on average, so it's not like you've got a surplus of cash to replace that outmoded big-screen TV, or upgrade to a better SUV or house. Speaking of houses, isn't it time to move up? Get that man cave you deserve, and the designer kitchen. If moving isn't on, then renovate. Granite beats laminate any day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's not pretend there's no downside to borrowing. It leaves you less money to save, and that can have an impact on your retirement income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, unemployment is a more dire risk when you're heavily indebted. But think of the free time you'll have to enjoy all your stuff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best news for borrowers is how depressing the global economic outlook is. Europe may be sliding into a recession, and that's going to choke back growth here and internationally. The <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> says our economy did better than expected at the end of 2011, and now it's likely going to slow down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Something to look forward to: A worse-than-expected economic performance that forces the central bank to cut interest rates. We may just see better rates than the best interest rates ever. Keep your fingers crossed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheers rang out at city hall as councillors voted to scale back spending cuts in Rob Ford's 2012 budget. The people had won! The mayor had suffered a fearful defeat. The Blue Meany had been put to flight by the joyful music of democratic solidarity. All You Need is Love, dat-da-da-da-da.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, what we witnessed on Tuesday night was a discouraging demonstration of how hard it is for politicians to take decisions to control spending. Finding a way to make governments live within their means is the project of this decade, not just in Canada but around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has thrown the governments of Europe into disarray. It is flummoxing the Congress and the presidency of the United States. At Queen's Park, Premier Dalton McGuinty's Liberal government is facing a cost-cutting task that will make Toronto's look like a walk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Complain about Mr. Ford if you will. Complain about how he said that cutting the “gravy” would be easy; complain about his often-inept handling of the budget debate; complain about his unwise decision to cut taxes before he had a good handle on the city's budget fix. But he is one of the few elected leaders to take the spending challenge head on. If Rob Ford can't lick it, who can?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He ordered a sweeping review of spending, paid outside experts to pore over every dime and invited the public to join months of consultations. As a result, city hall will still spend less this year than it did last, a rare achievement that Mr. Ford is quick to boast about. He also managed to cut the size of the city work force through layoffs and buyouts and to keep this year's property tax increase to a modest 2.5 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some of the toughest calls have been put off to another day. Even before council sat down to deliberate on Tuesday, the more controversial ideas, such as closing some library branches and cutting student nutrition programs, had been taken off the table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Council balked at a suggestion from KPMG consultants to save about $500,000 by ending community environment days, in which councillors mix with constituents while handing out leaf compost. It balked at ending sidewalk snow clearing for residential streets in the suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the budget finally came to a vote on Tuesday, council balked at several even more inoffensive cuts. Under a motion proposed by Josh Colle, the rookie councillor for Eglinton-Lawrence, it voted narrowly to “save” a further $15-million worth of programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The original 2012 budget proposed saving money by moving swimming programs from some school pools to nearby community pools, hardly a draconian measure. Councillors balked. Budget planners said they could save another chunk of money by closing 10 arenas during non-peak daytime hours, when they are in use only 8 per cent of the time. Councillors balked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The budget proposed closing three small city-owned daycares. One was only 43 per cent full. In another, intended for low-income families, 70 per cent of the children actually came from better-off families paying full fees. The city guaranteed every child a space in another daycare in the community. Councillors balked again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They voted to restore mechanical leaf collection in the suburbs, a concession to Etobicoke Centre Gloria Lindsay Luby. They even voted to put $300,000 back in the budget for the Live Green Toronto's “community animator” program, which helps residents with vital things like starting natural-food buying clubs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is worse, they achieved these dubious acts of salvation by dipping into leftover money from last year's budget. That means there is no permanent funding for the “saved” programs. When budget time comes around again next year, councillors will have to struggle once again to find a way to pay for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We don't build a stronger city reinstating service that we know we can't afford to pay for next year,” said TTC chair Karen Stintz. “We didn't get sent here to make easy choices, none of us did.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that is just what just over half of your city councillors did this week. Remember that come election time.</p>

The Supreme Court of Canada is hearing a Quebec case in which a billionaire's ex-common-law spouse accuses the province of discriminating against those who live common-law, by denying them the right to claim spousal support. Is it the Constitution's purpose to wipe out every possibility of unfairness, even at the cost of limiting an individual's freedom to choose?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec is the only province not to let common-law spouses claim spousal support as married couples do, in the event of separation. It also – in common with six other provinces – doesn't require a post-separation splitting of the family home and other assets and debts for common-law spouses.

They have voted with their feet and their “I do's” – or, more likely, their “I don'ts.” They are the most likely in all of Canada, and some say the world, to live in common-law relationships. Perhaps there are other reasons they have opted to make this choice, but if they wished for a change in the rules, they could press their government. There may be unique family, religious or cultural reasons for imposing fewer obligations on common-law couples that the Quebec government is best situated to weigh. Its elected legislators, not judges, should be making the complicated social-policy choice between free choice and fairness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The presumption of those who want the Quebec laws revised by the Supreme Court is that freedom of choice doesn't truly exist, in practice, for women with less power than men. This is hard to credit in modern, egalitarian Quebec. It is disrespectful and paternalistic to say that women are not capable of choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Choice must be paramount,” the Supreme Court said in a similar 2002 case from Nova Scotia involving property claims. “The decision to marry or not is intensely personal. Many . . . individuals in conjugal relationships of some permanence have chosen to avoid marriage and the legal consequences that flow from it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There may be a strong argument to alter the spousal-support rules. No other province has similar rules. The issue is one of need and dependency, not claims to property. For that matter, the loss of a stake in assets may also deprive individuals who contributed to the growth of those assets in various ways. But the argument should be made to legislators, not courts.</p>

A 2002 Senate report placed the cost of enforcing cannabis laws at $300-million annually – a figure that has surely risen.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The theme of this week's first ministers conference on health care might well have been: Be careful what you wish for.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, the provinces have been complaining about Ottawa's role in administering medicare. For the measly amount that the federal government contributes to provincial health-care budgets – now about 20 per cent, and shrinking – the provincial preference has been for the feds to sign a cheque, then buzz off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That attitude was best expressed this week by Quebec Premier Jean Charest, who, amid a diatribe on the funding formula that Ottawa presented by unilateral fiat, said the federal government doesn't operate the health-care system in Canada. “They know nothing about health care,” Mr. Charest said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond that, efforts by past federal governments to extract promises in exchange for their money, while well-intentioned, have proved to be misguided. The surgery wait-time targets that Paul Martin set out in the 2004 funding agreement, for instance, did not have the desired effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Focusing on specific procedures led to perverse outcomes. More surgeries in select areas – knees, hips – temporarily cleared up backlogs, but the vacuum was soon filled by people who could have waited years to have an operation. The exercise did little to help reduce the overall number of people getting operations or drive efficiencies but did succeed in fattening the wallets of the country's surgeons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now we have a situation where the federal government is prepared to write a cheque with no strings attached and the provinces still aren't happy – mostly about the size of the cheque. And no one is more displeased than Mr. Charest himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is nothing new, of course. When it comes to Quebec, it's always about the money – even though it receives a majority of the equalization payments handed out in Canada. As much as many provinces resent this fact (and have for years), you can imagine how Mr. Charest feels when he looks at a new funding arrangement that is going to give Alberta – a long-time critic of the federal largesse directed to Quebec – more than $1-billion a year. Quebec, meantime, could lose about $200-million a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than attack each other, however, the provinces united and directed their anger toward Stephen Harper. So far, the Prime Minister seems unmoved by their whining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behind the scenes at the first ministers conference, Mr. Charest exerted a lot of influence, according to numerous provincial officials. This isn't a surprise. The Quebec Premier has an institutional knowledge about federal-provincial relations that could fill volumes of history books. And he can be impressive in a room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He certainly was persuasive with a group of premiers, most of whom are much younger and less experienced than he is. Mr. Charest was most effective in decrying a funding formula he insists is a fundamental attack on the basic tenets of medicare itself. He argued, convincingly it appears, that inequities in the new plan will exacerbate inequities in health care across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside their meeting room, most eyes were focused on Alberta Premier Alison Redford, the have-not provinces enviously eyeing the loot she's getting under the new formula. In the end, Ms. Redford lent her voice of support to a working group established by the premiers to see whether a more equitable funding arrangement can be devised. Alberta's sole demand is that the per capita element of the new model be maintained – something her province has long been arguing for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta is suggesting that the funding shortcomings of provinces such as Quebec and Ontario be addressed through the back door using the federal equalization fund. I'm not sure how that helps provinces such as Saskatchewan and B.C., which also lose under the new funding formula but don't receive equalization payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My guess is the provinces – even Quebec – are going to have to live with the dollars Ottawa is giving them. They may not like it, but it's increasingly clear they may not have a choice.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Associate professor of law at Osgoode Hall Law School</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a controversial editorial on sex selection in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, interim editor-in-chief Rajendra Kale identified female feticide as an “evil” that “devalues women.” In his view, the deliberate use of ultrasonography to identify female fetuses followed by their abortion in some ethnic groups “is about discrimination against women in its most extreme form.” But why stop at gender? What about disability?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the fact that the fetus is rightly not a legal person and thus can't be the bearer of legal rights, there's a view shared by Dr. Kale and others that fetal sex selection, the deliberate identification of female fetuses by prospective parents and their elimination (with the result that significantly fewer girls are born, in a social and cultural context that differentially values human life on the basis of sex and reinforces practices that oppress on the basis of gender), is a form of gender discrimination. The debate is about how to stop it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do we, as Dr. Kale suggests, ban the disclosure of information about sex until after 30 weeks, or do we implement policies and educational strategies targeting sexist thinking (daughters are a burden, daughters cost too much) and practices (dowry, celebration of only the birth of boys, passing down the family name only through boys) underlying sex selection?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now consider a different characteristic. If Dr. Kale had cited evidence that a significant number of Canadians were deliberately using ultrasonography to identify fetuses with cleft palates or lips, missing limbs, spina bifida or Down syndrome, followed by their abortion, would he regard this as discrimination against some people with disabilities in its most extreme form?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I suspect not. Indeed, an ultrasound is part of prenatal screening that the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists believes should be offered to all pregnant women as part of surveillance for fetal anomalies. As any woman who has ever had an “undesirable” outcome after a prenatal screening ultrasound knows, abortion is an option discussed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if sex selection can be characterized as a social or cultural practice informed and perpetuated by demeaning attitudes toward women that many of us can agree is discriminatory, what about the selection of fetuses on the basis of disability? For those of us living with, or living with someone with, Down syndrome, a cleft lip or a missing limb, the selection against fetuses with these characteristics is as troubling as selection against female fetuses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the act of surveillance for and selection against fetuses with these characteristics sends the message that people with these characteristics are less valuable to society, just as the selection of female fetuses sends the message that women are less valuable than men. Moreover, why should we be more concerned about discrimination against women than discrimination against people with disabilities?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although I don't agree with Dr. Kale's solution of denying pregnant women ultrasound information until 30 weeks gestation, I, as both a woman and a mother of a child with an ultrasound detectable anomaly, believe that Dr. Kale's arguments about discrimination could be extended to fetal characteristics other than the presence of female and male genitalia. In a society committed to protecting the equality rights of women and persons with disabilities, we should be just as concerned about the use of ultra-sound to identify and eliminate fetuses on the basis of disability as we are about sex.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first lady of the United States endures a special kind of hell. She's a prisoner in a gilded cell. Her every move is scrutinized, to say nothing of her hair, her wardrobe and (if she's Michelle Obama) her muscle tone. She can never walk the dog in her sweats, take her kids to the mall, dress too badly or too well. If she ever had career aspirations of her own, she can forget them. Her job is to shut up, burnish the brand and project an image of wholesome family values and all-American normalcy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No wonder so many first ladies turn to drink. The effort it must take to maintain that facade of banal ordinariness would drive most of us into the loony bin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's okay with the public if a first lady is accomplished in some way – so long as she's harmless. Appearing harmless has been a tough assignment for Michelle Obama, who's obviously strong and obviously combative. Last week, she once again tried to reassure the nation that she's not an angry black woman – without sounding like an angry black woman. No, no, she insisted. Any hint that she had ever clashed with any of her husband's White House aides (as suggested in a new book she insists she hasn't read) was total mischief. “I guess it's just more interesting to imagine this conflicted situation here,” she said sweetly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, Michelle is not naturally sweet. She's an Amazon. If you cross her husband, she looks like she'll deck you. She's focused, driven and incredibly competitive. She's so organized she makes her daughters do their homework a day ahead of time. Like her husband, she's always thought of herself as an outsider, even though she went to Harvard and has led a highly successful yuppie life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the book she hasn't read (Jodi Kantor's The Obamas), Michelle was highly critical of many of her husband's top aides – including Rahm Emanuel, her husband's scrawny but exceptionally tough chief of staff who left in 2010 to run for mayor of Chicago. She and Mr. Emanuel cordially loathed each other. In his view, she was a nuisance who had no grasp of the grubby but essential game of politics in Washington. In her view, he was a foul-mouthed little twerp who failed to appreciate her husband's greatness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michelle is hardly the first lady who thinks her husband was let down by his advisers. Hillary Clinton loathed Mr. Emanuel, too. Both women were determined not to be ciphers in the White House. And both found that the institution of the presidency is remarkably ill-suited to modern power marriages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many ways, the Obamas are a study in contrasts. She's the confrontational one and the doer. He's the detached wonk. She thinks you can't make an omelette without breaking eggs. He thinks you can get reasonable people to find common ground and agree. (Or at least that's what he used to think.) He believes the political process is the best way to effect change. She's far more skeptical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barack Obama is a modern dad who has dinner with his kids most nights and coaches his daughter's basketball team. Yet, there was never any doubt about whose ambitions and career came first. Both Michelle and her husband believe he is a great man, a transformational figure who transcends politics. They have a low opinion of reporters, and often feel he's deeply misunderstood. Both believe that his chief drawback, if he has one, is that he isn't mean and tough and cynical enough for Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, Michelle chafed at restrictions of the White House. But she's mellowed. She's discovered that being one of the most admired and powerful women in the world (even though her power is totally derived from her husband) is not all bad. She's determined that her work on childhood obesity – which, like all first lady causes, is worthwhile while also being harmless – will be more than “just another first lady initiative.” The outsider is now the quintessential insider. And the gilded cell is not so bad.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just kidding. Man, I love Canadians. Or maybe it's decent, soft-hearted people in general. It seems like you can get them to do, or buy, or lend you almost anything if you just push the right buttons and/or ask them nicely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Decent, soft-hearted person (DSP): “This is a nice painting.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Artist: “Yes, I was experimenting with a new type of extra-quick brush stroke because it was so cold in my studio after they cut off the heat. … This piece is actually for sale if you're interested. Would you like to buy it?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DSP: “Uh … okay.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Me, I'm a cold-hearted bastard, more or less impervious to appeals to my “guilt” or “charity” bones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, I'm married to a real softie. Therefore, we have not only art by friends, but art by kids (I draw the line at art by kids of friends or friends of kids) adorning our walls, so I can understand where you're coming from.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news: It is not necessarily the acme of good taste, so I've heard, to have only tasteful things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The acme of good taste, according to those who claim to be in the know about such matters and clearly spend a lot of time thinking about them, is to have a house mostly full of tasteful things, but also to have a few tacky pieces that you've obviously kept strictly for their sentimental value – to show you have “heart.” I've even heard these same taste arbiters say that if you don't have one or two of these types of pieces, you should buy something horrible just to make it seem like you have something you're hanging on to for (faux) sentimental reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But you, sir, don't have to fake sentimentality: You really are a softie (cough cough sucker cough cough), apparently. And your house can take it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the question of how much, or even whether, one should encourage someone of minimal talent is moot here – I suppose. I mean, you say he's “very talented,” but … you've heard the saying “damn with faint praise,” right? You've sent this guy to Faint Praise Hell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or maybe it's Empty Phrase Hell: “I'm overjoyed his art exists … the world would be poorer without it … I just don't want to see it hanging in my living room.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'd rather be told my stuff stinks. “Dave's phrases are so pregnant with meaning I can feel them kicking … he utters verbiage so eloquent it's like a new day dawning for humanity… I just can't bring myself to read anything he writes.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, it's painful. It's like a knife in the gut. But if our work sucks, we “content creators” prefer our criticisms straight, no chaser, and certainly not enveloped in a cotton-candy-like coating of fake praise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, in your case, it's too late for that now that you've filled the air with praise mist and bought one of his pieces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More bad news: I'd say you have to display the piece fairly prominently, should he or any of your mutual acquaintances happen to come over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It doesn't have to be right in the foyer, mind you. But no hanging it facing the wall next to the boiler in the basement, either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look at it this way: $80 is a small price to pay if it causes you to button your flap, henceforward, vis-à-vis art and stop uttering hollow sentiments re: friends' stuff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because, uh, yeah, now that you've agreed to buy his art work, I would have to say, as a responsible advice columnist, that stiffing him, attempting to return his painting, and “coming clean” with your feelings about his work probably isn't kosher/cricket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You have to pay him the $80 you owe him. I'm sorry to use this word – I don't think I've used it before in this space – but it just may be called for here: Duh!</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alexander – for once – was allowed to sit at a cafeteria table with a group of boys who were all good friends. He watched one kid reach over and grab a bunch of French fries off another kid's plate. The boys laughed. Alexander, wanting to join in the fun, helped himself to a couple of fries, too. Alexander was made unwelcome at the table for any further lunch periods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have always been these children. They are often intelligent and may well get good grades. But they don't get it. Compared to other children their age they are significantly less adept at reading social cues. Nor do they have the self-awareness as to how they come across to others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many such children are now categorized as having Asperger's syndrome, part of what are considered autism spectrum disorders. But the bottom line is that there is a significant group of kids in high school who are noticeably socially awkward who are not only disliked, but often ostracized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teens are taught that it is wrong to be mean to kids with obvious disabilities – physically handicapped kids, or teens who are mentally disabled. Some teens still will be cruel to such kids, but the majority curb their behaviour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with those kids who are socially out of tune with their peers, other teens do not see it as a skill they lack. They see it as a personality flaw.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of Owen who goes on too long with his answers, “The kid thinks people are going to be interested in all his dumb stuff. But it's stupid.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of bossy Sondra, “She is so full of herself.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of Alexander, “He thinks he's so funny, but he's not. He's a loser.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what's a parent to do to make sure that their teen is more tolerant of those kids whose behaviour is chronically off-key?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You could start with something like:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are some kids – it's the way their brains work – who aren't as good at reading social cues. The way they act can seem different, because they see things differently – kind of like coming from another country with a different language and different customs. Their behaviour may bother you. But instead of saying to yourself ‘stupid' or ‘jerk,' maybe you could say ‘different.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And by the way, they might have skills that you don't, like knowing all about car models. Maybe you don't care so much about that, but maybe because they do care so much, they can help make better car models.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The above can help, but such statements are not what will make the biggest difference in your teen's tolerance. There are two more important factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One is that as a parent – far before the teenage years – you have a choice to be inclusive. For example in sports, having kids play who really aren't that good. It can drive athletic kids, as well as their parents, crazy. Being inclusive means everybody. Even at the expense of optimal fun. Should you invite everybody to your kid's birthday party, even Avery Nescomb, whom your kid hates? Do you draw a line? I'm for inclusion, but it can be tough in practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other is your own behaviour. What do you model in front of your kids? Do you uniformly show respect to others or do you regularly put people down?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Have you ever noticed that all those pizza-delivery kids are idiots?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Your aunt acts like she knows so much. But she doesn't know anything.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or do you consciously avoid such talk – even though you might think it? It sets a powerful model for your kids – one way or the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is your role in having your own teen be more tolerant of those who seem different from them? It is in practising inclusion. But also it is to the extent that you have shown respect toward others – all others.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade before medicare, the federal government financially supported hospitals across Canada; that came in 1957 under John Diefenbaker's government. Ottawa used its spending power to bring in medicare in the late 1960s, negotiating conditions with the provinces for the money.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1984 Canada Health Act outlined five medicare principles that provinces had to respect; failure to do so could result in Ottawa's withholding money. The prospect of losing federal money (and flying in the face of public opposition) enjoined provinces to end extra-billing by doctors and user fees for services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent decades, Ottawa always tried to tie some of its health-care money to certain objectives, usually with only fitful success. The last major money-tying effort came under the Paul Martin government, whose $41-billion in transfers over 10 years, indexed at 6 per cent annually, had a welter of federal-provincial commitments. When Stephen Harper was campaigning for the first time, he proposed a Patient Wait Times Guarantee linked to federal money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, however, Mr. Harper is going to give money to the provinces (they got federal tax points for health care a long time ago, a transfer they never mention) without any strings, conditions or demands. It'll be the first time since medicare began that a federal government has handed money over carte blanche.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broadly speaking, two reasons explain his decision – one theoretical, one political.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harper believes, when it suits his purposes, in a kind of classical federalism wherein the two levels of government more or less stay out of each other's jurisdiction. He thinks Liberal governments abused Ottawa's constitutional “spending power” to intrude into provincial jurisdiction, especially in social policy such as health care and daycare. Conservatives would rather use the federal tax system, or unconditional grants to the provinces, thereby respecting classical federalism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The politics of his decision have been almost completely ignored, but they're important for those who think about political angles all the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health care is a political hornet's nest. Governments can never spend enough money to satisfy those who want more health care in the form of more doctors and nurses, equipment, hospitals, community care, drug plans, research and so on. The less Ottawa has to do with health care, the easier the politics. Moreover, Conservatives have issues they think they own (crime, the economy, defence) and issues owned by others (health care, the environment) on which they essentially play defence. In these areas, they do enough to protect themselves but expend no political capital trying to persuade people to their point of view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By offering health-care increases of 6 per cent for five years, Mr. Harper has provided himself with a strong defence. He can say right through the next election that his government is spending at exactly the pace of the Paul Martin government. Who can complain?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The anticipated drop in indexing from 6 per cent to 4 per cent or 5 per cent thereafter won't figure in the next election, since the decline is hardly momentous. Put simply, Mr. Harper is trying – and he's likely to succeed – to take health care off the federal political agenda for the next four years, or at least give himself a plausible line of defence should it unexpectedly arrive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harper's view of federalism has a flip side: a stronger federal role shaping the national economy. This necessary imperative underpinned his government's attempt to create a national securities commission of the kind other industrialized countries use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Provinces, except Ontario, rose up against the idea. Their Little Canada view of such matters hardly surprised anyone. They preferred the defence of their jurisdiction above the good of the national economy. The Supreme Court, made up of lawyers, looked at the issue after a federal reference as one of jurisdiction rather than the functioning of the national economy, and agreed with the Little Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the space of a few weeks, then, Canada got a political decision from Ottawa to abandon all attempts to influence the country's most important social program, and a judicial decision to abandon an effort to improve the functioning of its internal economy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business lobbyists used to express grave concern about the economic impact of strikes. Those concerns were always overstated; time lost in work stoppages has declined by 90 per cent from the 1970s. Nevertheless, companies traditionally complain that work stoppages damage sales, productivity and, of course, profits.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, however, business leaders have warmed to work stoppages. In the current bargaining environment, companies (especially multinationals) hold the best cards. And executives are increasingly willing to precipitate their own stoppages – management lockouts – to press demands for lower wages and benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two New Year's Day lockouts highlighted this strategy. U.S.-based <span class="companylink">Caterpillar Inc</span>. locked out 450 locomotive builders in London, Ont., demanding wage cuts of more than 50 per cent. The same day, <span class="companylink">Rio Tinto</span>, the U.K.-based mining giant, locked out 755 smelter workers in Alma, Que. That company's demand to outsource all future bargaining-unit openings would ultimately achieve an even larger reduction in wages. In both cases, the future of middle-class incomes in our manufacturing and resource sectors is at stake, and executives are willing to lock the doors until workers swallow their pill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are just the latest in a growing trend by employers to lock out their own workers. <span class="companylink">U.S. Steel</span> used a 50-week lockout to dismantle the defined benefit pension plan for workers in Hamilton. Canada Post played the lockout card to precipitate back-to-work legislation from an obliging Harper government. And the City of Toronto is contemplating a lockout of thousands of workers to wrest union concessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suddenly, business rhetoric about the costs of long work stoppages has been silenced. To many employers, work stoppages – even long ones – are a small price to pay for driving down labour costs and boosting profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The popularity of lockouts reflects the dramatic tilting of the labour relations playing field in recent years. With unions on the defensive, management is eager to go for the jugular. Government has stood back or, worse, egged on the lockouts (as Ottawa did with Canada Post). Multinational firms are especially aggressive, given their ability (underwritten by free-trade agreements) to shift production and capital seamlessly between jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This trend is troubling, for macroeconomic as well as ethical reasons. As employers ratchet down compensation, income shifts from consumers (who spend every penny) to corporations (which sit on a growing pile of uninvested cash). That undermines aggregate spending and weakens the recovery. And the more employers succeed in driving down wages, the greater the danger of setting off a cycle of deflation in wages and prices (such as the one that bedevilled Japan for a decade).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So how should politicians respond? Pushing the companies to treat Canadian workers fairly would be a start, rather than ratifying their actions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labour law reforms could also play a role. Manitoba, for example, implemented an innovative provision in 2000 giving its labour board the authority to intervene in long disputes, including imposing arbitration when there's an impasse. It's been rarely invoked but has helped prevent all-out industrial warfare of the sort we're seeing at <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> and <span class="companylink">Rio Tinto</span>. This would be a good time for other jurisdictions to consider similar legislation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers speculate the birds infect each other with diverse flu strains. And once a bird is carrying several strains, there is a risk influenza genes will recombine into a new flu bug that's radically different from previous types. “Pandemics arise from dramatic changes in the influenza genome,” Dr. Shaman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He noted that La Nina occurs every two to seven years. Its arrival does not necessarily mean a pandemic is certain to erupt. “Many other things have to come into play,” he emphasized. “But, when you have these conditions, there is an increased likelihood that you could get a human pandemic.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that this hypothesis would be easy to verify through field studies of migratory birds and the germs they carry. If their hunch is correct, public health officials could soon have a new factor to consider when tracking impending pandemics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When insomnia is a good thing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many studies have shown that sleep plays a critical role in creating lasting memories. During shuteye, your brain replays the day's activities and stores away bits of data – not just facts and figures but also your emotional responses to those experiences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are, however, some things that are best forgotten. Unsettling memories of an emotionally disturbing event – such as being the victim of a crime or witnessing a gruesome accident – can trigger post traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, does the link between memory and sleep mean that PTSD can be prevented or reduced by simply not going to bed for an extended period after a traumatizing experience? Researchers at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, think so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team, led by Bengi Baran, recently completed a study that suggests emotional memories can be modified by altering the timing of sleep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study involved 68 female and 38 male volunteers between the ages of 18 and 30. They were shown a series of pictures, which included some disturbing images – such as a bloody crime scene and people with guns placed to their heads. The volunteers were asked to rate their emotional responses to the images.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twelve hours later, the participants were shown another series of pictures that included some of the earlier disturbing photos. Once again they were asked to rate their reactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One group of volunteers saw both sets of images the same day. Those in the other group were exposed to the first set late at night and they saw the second set early the next morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings, published in The Journal of Neuroscience, revealed that those who went to sleep in between viewing sessions had a more lasting negative impression of the gory images. In fact, they were equally upset the second time they saw the pictures, said Rebecca Spencer, the senior author of the study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, those who saw all the images the same day – with no sleep in between – had “a greatly reduced emotional reaction” the second time they saw the negative pictures, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Dr. Spencer the message is clear: Sleep helps to preserve, and reinforce, those unpleasant memories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why would a prolonged period of wakefulness after a shocking event lead to weaker emotional memories? With the passage of time, “you are piling more information into your brain and it might interfere with the initial reaction,” she speculated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More research will be needed to confirm the study findings. After all, the volunteers were looking at pictures, not witnessing a real traumatizing event. And the researchers can't yet say how long a person would need to stay awake to minimize the chances of developing PTSD.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Spencer noted that after an unsettling experience, a lot of people have difficulty sleeping. It's “almost as if your brain doesn't want to sleep on it,” she said. “The insomnia might be a healthy reaction.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More drug company transparency in the works</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. government will soon require drug companies to reveal the payments they make to doctors for research, consulting, speaking, travel and entertainment, The New York Times reported this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move by the Obama Administration is meant to curb potential conflicts of interest. Public health experts have long warned that these cash payments and freebies can have an undesirable influence on the prescribing habits of physicians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many medical associations and consumer advocates, including some in Canada, have called for greater public disclosure of the financial ties between physicians and industry. But, without mandatory rules, it's difficult to estimate the extent of these practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. officials reportedly plan to post the information online, and companies will face hefty fines if they fail to a make a full disclosure.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Toronto Raptors have had as successful a December/January as former Republican U.S. presidential candidate Rick Perry, going a scintillating 4-11 thus far, including their current six-game losing skid.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the TV cameras pan the Air Canada Centre most NBA game nights, there are more empty chairs than people. So it goes without saying the Raptors' TV ratings must be south of 0 C, right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guess again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the sample size is small, ratings for the post-NBA lockout Raptors are well ahead of last season's averages. According to the team, after three games, TSN was averaging 184,000 viewers compared to 150,000 last year. After five games, TSN2 was averaging 104,000 viewers compared to 96,000 last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Rogers Sportsnet</span>, after four games was averaging 198,500 viewers compared to 135,000 last year. And, after just one game, Sportsnet One/Ontario's Jan. 2 game against the New York Knicks averaged 159,000 viewers compared to 67,000 on the channel last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, the Raptors remain a steady if unspectacular TV property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It remains to be seen how those numbers will change if the on-court performance continues in this downward direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TALK THE TALK</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Hard work. Defence. Getting after it. Minute by minute. Day by day.” Which NBA head coach was Raptors TV play-by-play guy Matt Devlin getting excited about recently: Gregg Popovich, winner of four NBA titles? How about Phil Jackson, winner of 11 championship rings? Maybe it's Red Auerbach, winner of nine NBA crowns as a coach?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No, the correct answer is Dwane Casey, head coach of the 4-11 Raptors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Devlin pimps his Raptors. Is that different from Buck Martinez's gentle stroking of the Toronto Blue Jays? Joe Bowen's Toronto Maple Leafs high-volume homer-ism?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No, they're all generally on board with the efforts of the home team (which typically has right of approval on announcers). Just like members of the Boston Bruins media, who were given their day with the Stanley Cup this summer. Combined with the recent BCE Inc./Rogers Communications Inc. alliance to buy Raptors/Leafs owner Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd., these are not propitious times for independent journalism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While everyone has their conflicts, basketball often just sounds more partisan than other sports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps it's the liberal use of first names: “Andrea for three …!” or “Amir with the put-back.” Perhaps it's the more casual hip-hop culture surrounding the sport. Maybe it's the imperative to shout as if your left foot is on fire, à la Gus Johnson, or go bug-eyed crazy like Dick Vitale. Maybe it's as simple as Devlin and his MLSE minders feeling he still has to sell the sport to the frozen denizens of Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the reason, Devlin and his hoops colleagues often push the boundaries of familiarity more than other sports. Judging from the ratings above, however, it doesn't seem to be bothering anyone.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her original sentence of death by stoning was lifted amid international condemnation, including from Canada, the European Union and other countries. The Vatican pleaded for clemency. Brazil offered asylum. This latest development has not raised much outrage. It should.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ashtiani is serving 10 years after being convicted of helping to kill her husband. She was also convicted of having an “illicit relationship” with two men, a crime punishable by stoning, according to Islamic law. According to Amnesty International, she has received 99 lashings as part of her sentence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, Laureen Harper, the wife of the Canadian Prime Minister, and Indigo CEO Heather Reisman wrote to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, calling for her release from prison. Their letter read: “As mothers, sisters and daughters, we are gravely concerned about the unfair, undue legal processes faced by women in Iran. Repugnant sentences, such as death by stoning, are routinely rendered against women in Iran.” Lawrence Cannon, the minister of foreign affairs at the time, also expressed concern over reports she was forced to confess on Iranian television.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, a resolution adopted by 89 United Nations member states condemned stoning and the rise in death sentences for crimes “lacking a precise and explicit definition,” and Amnesty International released a report on the “dramatic rise” in death sentences for drug offences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ms. Ashtiani's case, though, the outcry has gone quiet. A website calling for her release, with a petition signed by Mrs. Harper and a host of celebrities such as Hugh Jackman, Sting and Yoko Ono has not been updated since 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mohammad Javad Larijani, secretary-general of the Iranian High Council for Human Rights, has reportedly said stoning should be considered a punishment, not a form of execution, adding it is more lenient. Why? Because half of the victims survive.</p>

It is an adaptation that reflects life in the digital age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laws against trespass, breaking and entering, burglary, and unreasonable search and seizure – protecting bricks-and-mortar rights, one might say – remain very important, but the same principles that underlie those older rights need to be complemented, in order to deal in an analogous way with what Mr. Justice Robert Sharpe – who wrote the three-judge panel's decision – calls informational privacy. The result is a new tort – that is, the civil-lawsuit equivalent of a crime – by the name of “intrusion upon seclusion.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this case, a <span class="companylink">Bank of Montreal</span> employee called Winnie Tsige broke repeatedly – 174 times – into the bank accounts of Sandra Jones, the former wife of a man with whom she was in a relationship; Ms. Jones worked for a different branch of the same bank. When confronted, Ms. Tsige acknowledged that she had no legitimate purpose in spying on Ms. Jones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Justice Sharpe is a prudent judge, by no means one to seek novelty for the sake of making a splash. The decision is well grounded in various more or less tentative judicial opinions about privacy, and in Charter jurisprudence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Above all, his reasons are measured. The damages for violations of privacy are not to be more than $20,000, except in very unusual circumstances. Perhaps most notably, the decision shows full respect for freedom of the press and freedom of expression, principles that had no relevance to Ms. Tsige's prying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is every reason to hope that, after the Jones v. Tsige case, hacking such as was undertaken by some employees of News of the World – happily, now defunct – would be subject to private lawsuits for damages, but that ethical and responsible journalism will not be affected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 1979, the Ontario of Appeal tried and failed to create a tort of discrimination, with little grounding in the evolution of the law; the Supreme Court overturned that decision. This week, Mr. Justice Sharpe and his colleagues have shown how to apply old principles in the age of high technology.</p>

She said she “valued our friendship” and would be in touch. Stunned, I said I'd be here when she was ready – but there's been no contact. Now I learn that she has put our mutual friends in the middle, refusing to attend functions if I'm to be there. Should I contact her before all my friendships are compromised?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Respect boundaries</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is your former friend's absolute right to decide not to attend functions where you may be present. It sounds like your friend has made some healthy boundary choices. Perhaps your former relationship was based on enablement. Friendships are dynamic and ever-changing. You probably could benefit from doing some soul searching of your own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– Kathleen Schiegl, Toronto</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reach out</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Courtesy calls for one attempt to reach out to show you care about the friendship or perhaps open the door to offer an apology if there is reason for one. If nothing happens, close the door. Let your friends in the middle know you are sad at losing your friend and you tried to make amends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– Annabel Campbell, Castleton, Ont.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Read the writing on the wall</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If she is polling mutual friends to determine if you will be present, this clearly says your friendship is over. I wouldn't spend too much time worrying about living your life around her. If your mutual friends ask about the situation, tell them, but stay on the high road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– Greg Merritt, Fredericton</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE FINAL WORD</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are you at all curious as to what prompted your friend to take a pizza knife to the fragment of her life that had you in it? Because I sure am. I'm assuming she gave you a reason beyond “deep soul searching” and as a result you've spent the past two years, as Kathleen says, doing some soul searching of your own. But if she didn't give you a reason and you didn't ask for a reason and you've spent these past years assuming it's her and not you, that itself may be indicative of why your friend has backed away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the case, two years is long enough for you both to be at peace with the obvious fact that the friendship is, as Greg observes, kaput.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I disagree with Annabel that “courtesy” dictates you reach out to your erstwhile friend one final time. You've already granted her single request – that you leave her alone – and since the friendship is over (keep repeating that until it sinks in), you owe her nothing more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truth is, your ex-pal isn't putting anyone in the middle of anything, she's simply letting your mutual friends know that if you're at a gathering, she won't be. That's hard for you, but it's not exactly the Gordian Knot of social etiquette.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whenever I get letters from folks in similar situations: “We want to invite X, but also Y, and X and Y despise each other,” I reply with the old slogan “Let go and let God.” That is, invite who you want and let the disputing parties sort it out between themselves. In short, if this woman has a problem with you, that's her problem. Your problem is an inability to accept the fact that – third time's a charm! – the friendship is over.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's foreign policy is being subjected to yet another “review,” and an announcement of this government's priorities may be imminent. Nothing has been reviewed so relentlessly over the years with so little in the way of revelation, impact, direction or useful purpose as this country's foreign policy. To some extent, it betrays a reluctance to accept the reality of what we are and where we are. At the very least, the government should make a virtue of simplicity and precision, offering a clear-headed view of what our priorities need to be and why, while avoiding “feel good” nostrums about how we'd like others to see us.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cornerstone of our foreign policy must be the management of relations with the United States, not for reasons of sentiment but because that's how we preserve our most vital economic and security interests and our capacity for global influence. When we get this part of the equation right, our relevance and influence on global issues increases accordingly. When we don't, our influence and relevance wanes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're an Arctic and a Western Hemisphere nation, and our foreign policy priorities should anchor these dimensions as well, especially since the economic potential of both is likely to increase in the decades ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dramatic shift in economic power to rising stars such as China, India, South Korea and Brazil should also dictate a change of focus for Canada, especially since trade is a major component of foreign policy and many of these countries need commodities, which are pivotal to Canada's growth prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What needs to be recognized, however, is that conventional rules for trade and investment don't apply as much to those emerging markets whose production and investment fall largely under government control. Canada would benefit more from a strategy that leverages our resources as the means to secure better access for our exporters and investors in markets currently enjoying high rates of growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maintaining an effective, agile military capacity will ensure that Canada can continue to play a selective role on behalf of the United Nations or NATO in combatting threats to global peace. But we shouldn't pretend to be a universal donor. Future involvement should be calibrated against judicious assessments of our capacity and our interests, and not a Boy Scout inclination to be helpful fixers everywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hard lesson from Afghanistan and Iraq is that military options have limited long-term effect. “Muscular diplomacy,” the use of sanctions, and carrot and stick negotiations offer a needed complementary role and should be given greater emphasis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Middle East is a quagmire where the earnestness of Canada's desire to be involved exceeds any rational analysis of our direct interests or our capacity for influence. But the same can't be said for our relations with Turkey and Persian Gulf states such as Qatar that are playing constructive regional roles and with whom our ties need strengthening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nuclear non-proliferation is an issue on which Canada has real expertise. As the major flashpoints for global insecurity are likely to come from unstable nuclear powers such as Pakistan and North Korea or wannabes such as Iran, Canada should bolster its efforts with allies to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development assistance is also an instrument of foreign policy, but more analysis is needed for what works and what doesn't. Rather than identifying priority sectors or countries for concentration, we need to target contributions in ways that underscore Canadian strengths and make a demonstrable difference to those in need.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Attention must always be given to fundamental principles of our political system – democracy and human rights, gender equality, religious freedom etc. – but these are best espoused by the model we present at home and by collaboration with those whose values we share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">G8 and G20 summits are the pinnacle of Canada's global involvement. Our solid financial and economic record gives us credentials better than most to articulate and influence action contributing to stability and growth. As our economy continues to grow, while those in Europe sputter, our voice and our influence should increase accordingly. And less emphasis should be given to summits of marginal value, such as the Commonwealth and Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada has indulged in more foreign policy reviews than any country of comparable size. More navel-gazing may simply magnify particles of lint. Ultimately, the effect of Canada's role in the world will be determined more by what we do than what we say we should do.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An arbitration ruling last October involving Nova Scotia nurses is a real page-turner, guaranteed to keep you awake at night – if you happen to be one of Canada's 13 provincial and territorial health ministers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nova Scotia government's successful run with restraint – capping public-sector wage increases at 1 per cent annually – ended with that ruling. The arbitrators decided that nurses' salaries in Nova Scotia ought to keep pace with those of nurses in other, richer provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These nurses have always been the highest paid in Atlantic Canada and in the middle of the Canadian pack,” the arbitrators ruled. So the public in have-not Nova Scotia must pay to keep up with the “have” province of Newfoundland, which could afford to give its nurses double-digit salary increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's the cliffhanger: Another bargaining unit representing health workers ranging from psychologists to porters is heading into contract talks next month. That group – represented by the same union as Nova Scotia's nurses – is threatening to strike if they don't get the same 5.1-per-cent increase in the first year. If they win, the rest of the 23,000-member Nova Scotia Government and General Employees Union will doubtless demand the same raise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such whip-sawing by health-care workers is an old story. As the reality of the new Canada Health Transfer sinks in – a redistribution announced by Ottawa last month that cuts the rate of growth over the coming decade – the provinces are suddenly keen to craft a strategy to curb the interprovincial competition for health-care workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labour costs are the single biggest factor in health-care budgets. In B.C. they make up 62 per cent of the $12.6-billion annual budget. In Nova Scotia, they make up 70 per cent of the health budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall and Prince Edward Island Premier Robert Ghiz agreed to take a stab at the health human-resources challenge as part of their countrywide innovation working group. Every province has a stake in this question. Nurses in B.C. got around government wage controls in 2009 with a “labour market adjustment” because they argued B.C. couldn't recruit and retain nurses here when other provinces offered better pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trick will be persuading wealthier provinces to abandon the practice of buying their way out of labour shortages. And B.C. is one of the predatory provinces. Between 2006 and 2010, according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI), this province had the highest in-migration of physicians in the country. Hundreds of doctors have moved here from other provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doctors – in fact all health-care workers in B.C. – are in contract negotiations this year. It's unlikely the premiers will be able to concoct a plan before the province settles, but the other provinces would welcome a firm hand to set the tone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premiers Wall and Ghiz have six months to draft standards to ensure innovations are shared among the country's 13 separate health-care systems. But don't be misled by the “innovation” label – there is a heavy focus on labour costs. Not only will they try to forge a pact to limit competition for unionized health workers, they are kicking around the idea of a Canadian fee structure for services, which would take aim at doctors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most doctors negotiate fees for service rather than salaries, and as a group they been successful in bucking the restraint trends in public-sector salaries. The cost of paying physicians has been among the fastest-growing health categories in Canada in recent years, another CIHI finding. Between 1998 and 2008, their pay was increasing at an annual rate of 6.8 per cent each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Evans, an economics professor at the University of B.C.'s Centre for Health Services and Policy Research, is skeptical about the ability of the provinces to tackle the problem so long as the Harper government refuses to get involved. “What you need to do is develop interprovincial agreements about how much you are going to pay – it has to be binding, with financial teeth.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it won't be easy to break old habits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They can try that all they want, it's not going to work,” said Joan Jessome, president of the Nova Scotia Government and General Employees Union. “There will be labour unrest from one end of the country to the other.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PER CAPITA FUNDING</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premiers have launched a health-care working group to trade “innovation” tips in response to the Harper government's move to a new funding formula that will provide the same amount of cash for every Canadian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that formula doesn't produce comparable health care, because the cost of delivering service depends on many factors, including demographics and regional realitie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's the current per-capita health-care spending across the provinces:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Per capita, current figures</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm channelling Margaret Thatcher here, aka the Iron Lady, Britain's first female prime minister, imagining her horrified reaction to a controversial new biopic, The Iron Lady, and to the glorious but questionable performance by Meryl Streep who so ferociously becomes her that she will no doubt waltz away with an Oscar next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Depending where you are on the political spectrum, Margaret, Baroness Thatcher, now 86, sadly suffering from dementia and hidden from public view, was either the greatest British leader since Winston Churchill, dragging Britain into the modern age, or a holy Conservative terror who destroyed whole industries, slashed the benefits of her neediest citizens and imperiously finger-wagged her way through 11 tumultuous years (1979-1990) in power. Wearing her double set of pearls, she even marched into war with Argentina over the obscure Falkland Islands, and, by God, give or take several hundred dead bodies, she won.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've seen the movie twice and each time I come away thinking what a surprising, brave and ultimately interesting choice director Phyllida Lloyd (of Mamma Mia! fame) has made, opting to focus so much on Mrs. Thatcher's current reduced mental state. She depicts her stumbling around her London home, hallucinating her dead husband Denis, desperately trying to remember and put in sequence her glory days as the political leader, who along with former U.S. president Ronald Reagan (who also spent years diminished by Alzheimer's before his death) redefined conservatism for the modern era.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Call it Irony Lady. How could such a formidable and ground-breaking leader end up on the screen like any other addled elderly woman who never changed history at all, her once famously styled hair dishevelled, quizzically trying to grasp both the past and the present (for Alzheimer's sufferers there is no future), standing over the kitchen sink, soaping her lone tea cup even though that was precisely what she passionately told her then fiancé Denis she would never do – die doing the washing up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British Prime Minister David Cameron this week rebuked the movie for turning his country's lone legendary female leader (apart from the Queen, who apparently never liked Mrs. Thatcher) into an object of pity, saying it should have been “delayed” until her death. The critics, while lauding Ms. Streep's brilliant turn, have been at best lukewarm about a movie they grumble doesn't do Mrs. Thatcher's controversial political career justice. And some commentators have said this would never happen to a male politician of Mrs. Thatcher's stature – instead of a gritty play-by-play of her political life, she gets a movie highlighting an oddly sexy woman , the daughter of a grocer, who turned her back on her children's needs and paid a uniquely high price for power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonsense. Every politician, male or female, sacrifices family life in the quest for power. Mrs. Thatcher was no exception, but like few women in politics, she had a publicly devoted spouse in Denis, a successful businessman who stood steadily and humbly at her side for all of her career. He was roundly made fun of in his time for being either hen-pecked or too first lady-ish. The movie, with Jim Broadbent as the ghost of Denis, is also a portrait of their enduring marriage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Margaret Thatcher had no use for women's liberation, or for most women for that matter. “I've always preferred the company of men,” she says in the movie to her clearly damaged adult daughter. Yet she encountered every bit of the same sexism that transformed many women of her time into ardent feminists – she was criticized for “shrieking” when she was merely speaking forcefully, for acting like a “housewife” instead of a leader, for being hectoring and nannyish, and of course for verbally castrating her male colleagues. “Weak, weak, weak,” Ms. Streep as Mrs. Thatcher hisses, about the frustrated and humiliated cabal of Conservative men who eventually deposed her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In England, the movie is packing them in. You could put a prurient spin on that, saying that many Brits might even delight in seeing her so humbled, not able to fully enjoy her elder stateswoman status. (Think of how much of a force she still could have been, pronouncing on foreign affairs, showing up to speak at conferences.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Never mind. It won't get its critical due, but The Iron Lady is a wonderful essay on how many of the mighty are felled: Not by invading armies, not by Machiavellian practitioners of the dark art of politics, not by scandal or moral weakness, not even by their own hubris or Icarus-like compulsion to fly too close to the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No, they are felled as you or I could be – by the ravages of age and the tragedy of a keen mind sputtering, dimming, then dying as the body limps on. Even her opponents couldn't wish this on the Iron Lady.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the contemplation of such mortality, up there on the silver screen, makes for a powerful and poignant – and ultimately more universal – experience. Ironically, she will gain new fans because of it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even half-watching the Golden Globes the other night, it was impossible to miss how the camera kept returning to Harvey Weinstein, the heavy-set man with the close-cropped hair and facial stubble who beamed and nodded when he was called “God” by Meryl Streep as she accepted her award for The Iron Lady.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Madonna called him “The Punisher” when she got her best song award, and Weinstein was thanked by Michelle Williams for My Week with Marilyn and director Michel Hazanavicius for the French film The Artist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A cynic might wonder if the shout-outs were orchestrated. Weinstein, a non-movie star who has been the subject of books, innumerable profiles, and a documentary by Toronto's Barry Avrich, is a master promoter. He's a flashy, foul-mouthed impresario with a reputed magic touch for awards – the “Oscar king” as Stephen Schaefer called him in the Boston Herald.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How many Oscars has Weinstein won? The number might surprise you. It's precisely one, for producing Shakespeare in Love back in 1999. He also had a nomination for Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York in 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the Golden Globe films that were labeled as Weinstein's films, only My Week with Marilyn was actually produced by <span class="companylink">The Weinstein Company</span>, the studio he formed in 2005 after he left Miramax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harvey Weinstein and his brother, Bob, former rock promoters, changed the face of independent film in the last 30 years by investing in foreign films through pre-sales, acquiring already made films in some cases, reworking them and distributing them in a way that appeals to North American taste.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also changed the awards season through ferocious campaigning. During his years running Miramax as an independent division of <span class="companylink">Disney</span> until 2005, the company earned 249 Oscar nominations and 60 wins for such films as Good Will Hunting, Shakespeare in Love, The English Patient and Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 1999, when major studios might pay $2-million on a movie's Oscar campaign, Miramax paid $5-million to promote Shakespeare in Love. Among their techniques, they used publicists who were academy members to schmooze their academy colleagues. His strategies are generally credited with the academy imposing a crackdown on Oscar campaigning after the nominations are announced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has also been accused of smear campaigns against rival films. When asked about the attacks on Slumdog Millionaire, he replied: “What can I say?

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weinstein, by promoting small-budget art-house films as though they were blockbusters, has also changed the media perception of the Oscars, which, a generation ago, had about as much news value as the Miss Universe contest, and is now covered as fervently as the Super Bowl. Not all of this has actually benefited the academy. As smaller art-house films began to dominate the nominations, TV viewership has declined. As a consequence, the academy moved to expand the Best Picture nominations to 10 in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today <span class="companylink">The Weinstein Company</span> is a shell of what it was, after a series of bad investments, restructuring in 2009, selling off much of its catalogue and laying off employees after burning through about $1.2-billion from <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>. But then, last year, Weinstein was back with The King's Speech, a $20-million inspirational British movie he distributed because he smelled Oscar contender. The film was the first Best Picture nomination for a Weinstein film since Chicago back in 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with The Artist a front-runner for Best Picture, and Meryl Streep a shoo-in for Best Actress, we're going to be hearing a lot more about how Harvey got his groove back. It's a good comeback story, though like most players in the indie-movie scene, it's really more a case of Weinstein digging himself out of a ditch.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘Redford questions pipeline hearings credibility,” the headline read.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There he goes, again, thought I. Robert Redford in high dudgeon over the Northern Gateway pipeline, lecturing Canadians as yet another of those – in the measured words of Joe Oliver – “jet-setting celebrities with some of the largest personal carbon footprints in the world” this side of Peter MacKay. Okay, he didn't mention the high-flying, newly wedded Defence Minister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And “Redford” wasn't the aging Sundance Kid, at all. It was, of course, Alison Redford, still so fresh on the national stage as Premier of Alberta that an editor at one newspaper, after seeing an earlier “Redford” headline, wondered why Robert was meeting Stephen Harper in Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which brings us to this week's gathering of the premiers in surprisingly wintry Victoria. Ms. Redford, alone among them, embraced Ottawa's unilateral decision to base future federal health-care transfers strictly on per-capita. No adjustments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, provincial coffers will get just as much Ottawa cash for a healthy young buck of 25 as for someone in his so-called “golden years” despite the fact that geezers cost the health-care system much more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guess which province has, by far, the lowest percentage of Canadians over 65. Resource-rich Alberta, of course. And which stands to reap an annual windfall of $900-million or so from the funding switch, starting in 2014? Yep, Alberta again, the only province wealthy enough to have no need of a sales tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk about piling on. But Ms. Redford sees nothing wrong with any of this. “I believe that every Canadian is entitled to the same amount of money through the Canadian health transfer as every other Canadian,” she declared, underscoring Alberta's great political wisdom to entice the oil industry within its boundaries, when it might have gone, say, to Quebec or Ontario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever, it's not much of a contribution to federalism and the concept of equal quality of health care across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One is reminded of the words of a man who has never been mistaken for Robert Redford, former B.C. premier Mike Harcourt: “Albertans are essentially vampires living off dead dinosaurs. They just put their fangs into the ground and out comes the black gold [oil].”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was kidding. I think.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Okay, pain aficionados. Which is worse?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a Tuesday post called Lying Here with My Head on the Phone, Ms. Armstrong sets herself up to answer an aching question from one of her daughters: “ ‘Mom?' she asks. She doesn't wait for me to answer. ‘Why does Dad not sleep here any more?' ”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Armstrong shares the gentle answer, and breezes through a sad memory of her parents' divorce, plus a recent moment in which she considered suicide. She wraps up with a request for her readers to bear with her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How could they not? This is riveting. While Ms. Armstrong has a knack for humour and anecdote, her reputation was built on her writings about postpartum depression after her first daughter, Leta, was born.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many followers, however, were reminded this week that personal blogging is a peculiar milieu, which can rely more on the illusion of intimacy than the real thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some observers just had to question the sudden admission, suggesting they expected more candour from Ms. Armstrong. (Mr. Armstrong also addressed the split on his blog, Blurbomat.com in a piece called Yes, I'm Currently in a Trial Separation.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joyce Slaton commented on the Armstrongs on Babycenter.com item: “It makes me feel a little disappointed in a famously open blogger that a real, genuine portrait of a faltering marriage wasn't presented. It'd be interesting to read something real about a real marriage. I guess that's a lot to ask.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bloggers Magda Pecsenye and Doug French have been there. Well known for their individual blogs (Ask Moxie and Laid off Dad), the pair actually started a blog about co-parenting after divorce, When The Flames Go Up. Ms. Pecsenye and Mr. French avoided writing about their split for several months in part because of the risk of demonizing one another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Obviously, in blogging, you are not writing every thought you have, or every action you do, but it can seem like you do,” she writes in an e-mail. “So when it turns out that there have been all sorts of things going on in the background that didn't make it onto the blog, readers can feel shocked.” She says it's one thing if it's a pregnancy you couldn't announce, “but if it's something bad like a divorce, they feel betrayed.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. French, who is friends with the Armstrongs and doesn't want to comment specifically, sees their separation as much more public due to their fame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While he doesn't expect either party to air grievances online, he points out, “I felt my path was trickier to navigate because it's more acceptable for a woman to speak ill about her husband than vice versa.” He's actually planning a panel discussion at an upcoming conference on blogging and gender politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ironically, or fittingly, some of Ms. Armstrong's best work may be ahead. Mr. French says the best piece of writing to come out of his divorce was an essay penned for his sons – which was published in an anthology Ms. Armstrong edited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Pecsenye says she thinks writers do write better in distress. “It strips you down to what's essential.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Armstrong has posted a thank you to her readers for their support. And a tweet she wrote hints at the humour ahead. “Hey guys, my therapist wants you to know that I'm okay and that I'm only going to need about two exorcisms.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawyers are in the final stages of drafting documents to be filed in court as early as next week that are expected to set in motion a class-action lawsuit that threatens to further destabilize one of the most iconic institutions in the country – the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this point, 94 current and former female members of the force from every province have asked to join the suit that is seeking damages potentially in the tens of millions of dollars for alleged maltreatment on the job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's expected the number of women involved in the action will eventually be well over 100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless of its outcome, the lawsuit, and the vast array of ugly harassment-related charges contained within it, is likely to provoke profound changes within the walls of an organization whose reputation has been shattered in recent years. New RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson has vowed to investigate all harassment complaints thoroughly and take a zero-tolerance attitude towards workplace abuse going forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawyers in B.C. and Ontario have been working on the case for months. The lawsuit will be filed in either B.C. Supreme Court or federal court on behalf of a couple of as-yet-unnamed officers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lawsuit will seek certification as a class action, which will allow others to join as plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It generally takes judges between one and two years before rendering a certification decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vancouver lawyer David Klein, of Klein Lyons, said there are five tests a judge uses to determine whether the case qualifies for class-action status, including whether there are “questions of fact and law” common to all of the plaintiffs. He said in that regard, any female who joins the force is “guaranteed an environment that is free from gender-based discrimination and harassment.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A pledge all the potential plaintiffs assert was broken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Klein, a class-action specialist, said this case is more complex because it involves a federal agency which receives legal protections that non-governmental agencies do not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Alexander Zaitzeff, a lawyer from Thunder Bay involved in the case, says it's difficult to imagine a judge not certifying the case given the universal nature of the complaints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zaitzeff, a claims lawyer for 36 years, has been interviewing the past and present RCMP members looking to join the lawsuit. Over the course of his career, he says he's handled just about every type of personal injury case imaginable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And I have to tell you these are some of the saddest stories I've ever heard,” he said in an interview. “We're talking about horribly broken lives here. What you often don't think about is the toll harassment takes on the families. Spouses are impacted, relationships and marriages can end. Kids are impacted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Some of the kids start drinking at younger ages. You see early onset anti-social behaviour. They see what's happening to their parent and they take on some of the same symptoms – it's known as referred post-traumatic stress disorder.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zaitzeff, who represented families affected by the Dryden air crash of 1989 which killed 24 people, said the allegations range from sexual assault and harassment to bullying and daily intimidation. He said the members' stories will reveal workplace abuse so egregious it had some considering suicide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most class-action suits are settled out of court. Mr. Zaitzeff said the courts have awarded individuals anywhere from less than $100,000 to more than $1-million in harassment-related cases in the past. But he said not one person who has contacted the lawyers about joining the suit has asked how much money they stand to make.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have, however, expressed fear of reprisals from co-workers should it be discovered they are part of the suit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Klein said the identities of the women are protected, if that is their wish. He said the only way they could be revealed is if the case proceeds to court and there are individual adjudications. But before that happened, the plaintiffs would have the opportunity to decide if they wanted to carry on or stop and protect their identity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could be four or five years after the action is commenced, as class-action lawsuits can take an excruciatingly long time to conclude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either way, Mike Webster, a psychologist who has treated some of the women who are joining the lawsuit, said he is impressed by their courage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They are coming from an organization that creates a culture of fear and intimidation,” Mr. Webster said. “Those in command use their authority to intimidate others and discourage them from speaking out. It's all part of the para-militaristic hierarchy that exists. That's why so few step outside the group and criticize those in authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But now these women have strength in numbers. And that is very assuring.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcer said, “The monks of Oka, Quebec, knew how to make cheese like the back of their hand.” Robin Jones wrote: “I don't want to eat cheese that is like the back of a monk's hand. Do you?”</p>

(3) The familiar round of Oka cheese wasn't always like that.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smyth has beaten by a decade the Oxford Dictionary of English (a shorter cousin of the Oxford English Dictionary), which says the term originated in Ireland in the 1950s. It offers two possible origins for the word. One is the French noun guerrier, warrior. The other is gur cake, an Irish-English term for a mincemeat-filled slice of pastry that used to be associated with street urchins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After this column discussed felt and filter, from the Latin filtrum, reader David Antscherl inquired about philtrum, the word for that “vertical depression or runnel (I use that word deliberately) between the nose and upper lip.” He wondered whether there was a connection with the filter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer is no, but the philtrum has its own curious origin. Although it was used in English by 1653 to refer to the vertical groove between the base of the nose and the border of the upper lip, philtrum had entered the language in 1609 (and even earlier as philtre) in the sense of a love potion. The word derived, by way of the Latin philtrum, from the Greek philtron – philos meaning loving or beloved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Why the median vertical groove in the upper lip is called the philtrum is unknown,” Californian gastroenterologist William S. Haubrich wrote in his 1984 book Medical Meanings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps, perhaps not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upper lip is known as Cupid's bow because of its shape, and Cupid was the Roman god of love. Moreover, there is a belief in the webiverse that the ancient Greeks considered the philtrum one of the more erogenous parts of the body, which would tie in with the love potion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alas, I could find no printed source to back this up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should any ancient Greeks be reading this – or, failing that, Hellenic scholars – confirmation would be a philological (philo, love of, logos, the word) gift.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, as he watched the great uprisings in Tunis and Cairo, French scholar Olivier Roy declared that they marked the end of Islamist politics. “If you look at the people who launched these revolts,” he wrote, “it is clear that they represent a post-Islamist generation. … The new revolutionaries are perhaps practising or even devout Muslims, but they separate their religious faith from their political agenda. In that sense, it is a ‘secular' movement that separates religion from politics.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, you might say, how awkward. Those January protesters may have been secular and liberal, but, when I visited Tahrir Square six months later, Islamists commanded the stage. We've recently watched Egypt's first somewhat free elections give 48 per cent of the vote to a party controlled by the Muslim Brotherhood, plus 20 per cent to 28 per cent to Salafists, who aren't just Islamist but want an actual theocracy. Secular liberals were left with a rump of 15 per cent to 20 per cent. If this is “post-Islamist,” it sure has a lot of crescents and guys with beards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, Dr. Roy – probably the world's most respected scholar on Islamic societies and politics – was asked to explain himself on French radio. Did the Islamist electoral victories in Tunisia and Egypt pour cold water on his “post-Islamist” prognostication? Quite the contrary, he said. They proved it. The new individualism behind the Arab revolutions, he said, has led Arabs to vote for parties with an Islamic identity (in large part, because “secularism” was strongly associated with the dictatorships they overthrew) – but, in the process, it's forced those parties to abandon the Islamist goal of a pure religious society governed only by the Koran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Islamist movements like Ennahda in Tunisia and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt can no longer even be called Islamist,” he said. “They are conservatives analogous to the religious right in the United States.” Much as socialist parties in the West had to abandon the revolutionary goals of Marxism to become electable, the new Islamist parties have had to give up actual Islamism: They can't impose the Koran on people, but rather combine “a religious reference” with democratic bids to influence “family values.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't quite share Mr. Roy's optimism. While an Iranian-style theocracy isn't a possibility in Egypt, there are leaders in the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party whose views on women and Israel are alarming enough and whose ties to Egypt's military overlords appear authoritarian enough that the result could look a lot like Islamism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where the “post-Islamism” scholars do have a point is in their reading of the trends that led people to vote for the Islamist parties. These, paradoxically enough, are driven by a shift to secularization of private life. Egypt and its neighbours are in the midst of the same demographic change that revolutionized the West two centuries ago: Fertility rates are falling to European levels, and institutions such as first-cousin marriages are becoming increasingly rare. Religion has become a badge of identity, not a way of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This shift has made Islamists desperate to seize influence, because social influence can now only be won through politics. And it has put them in a unique position to gain it. Former Ottoman states such as Egypt never bothered to replace the religious obligation to give alms with a secular obligation to pay taxes. So the imams and mullahs became not only the leading voice of dissent but also the leading source of welfare. That, more than the Koran, wins them votes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The fundamental contradiction of Islamism is that its leaders think of themselves as guardians of a tradition, whereas the popular wave behind them is the result of a modernizing mental revolution,” demographers Youssef Courbage and Emmanuel Todd write in their analysis of Muslim-country modernization, A Convergence of Civilizations. “Political victory is inevitably followed by cultural defeat.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In between comes a tumultuous time. The Muslim world is becoming modern the same way France did, with wild swings of revolution and reaction. “Westerners would like to forget,” the two demographers conclude, “that their own demographic transitions were also strewn with many disturbances and a good deal of violence.” It's not a safe and easy path, but it's progress.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘Maybe Rome Was Built in a Day!”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty years on, Ottawa Senators president Cyril Leeder is still chuckling over that legendary Ottawa Citizen headline that greeted his team's first game back in the NHL – a 5-3 victory over the Montreal Canadiens, who went on to win the 1992-93 Stanley Cup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Then we go off to Quebec City and get bombed 9-2.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took the reborn Senators to the end of the month to earn their next point, and to the end of the next month to get their next win, eventually ending up with 24 points and an all-time NHL record for futility on the road: a single victory in 42 attempts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leeder was there from the very beginning, was one of the original three – Bruce Firestone and Randy Sexton the others – popping a few beer in the dressing room after a game of shinny and deciding they could somehow convince the NHL to grant a franchise to Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their scheme seemed preposterous. Firestone had this notion that there is “a natural relationship between hockey and real estate,” Leeder put together their leather-bound, 600-page application, Sexton did the contacts and much of the selling. Not only would they build a new rink, they would establish a new town of close to 10,000 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian franchise should likely have gone to Hamilton, but the Hamilton people balked at paying the $50-million expansion fee at once while the Ottawa pitch offered cash on the barrel, even though they didn't have it. Same with Tampa Bay, which also got a franchise that should have gone to deeper pockets. But no matter, both were in and both, miraculously, are still in 20 years later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leeder was there through all the madness – the Alexandre Daigle and Alexei Yashin years, the change of ownership as financier Rod Bryden became majority owner, the bankruptcy that eventually put the franchise in the hands of multimillionaire Eugene Melnyk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leeder was there for the battles to build a rink in a distant corn field on the western fringes. They dug a hole and couldn't finish. The Coast Guard came in to determine if the trickling Carp River was going to be affected. Workers found bones that some thought were evidence of a sacrificial lamb. They even had to build their own exit off Highway 417 when the Ontario government refused.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But 16 years have passed since that new rink finally opened on a cold January day in 1996 and this week the NHL's all-star game will be played in that rink that took so long to get built. And while no one would ever mistake Kanata for Rome, the changes are remarkably as Firestone first envisioned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Bruce was right on the money,” Leeder says. “He's always been about 10 years ahead of the curve.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where once there were only fields and scrub bush, there is housing as far as the eye can see. The rink is surrounded by office buildings and car dealerships, with a massive outlet mall tagged to go in across the highway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When we first moved to Kanata in 1992,” Leeder says, “you had to go elsewhere to shop or go to a restaurant.” No longer, though. As for those NHL people arriving in 2012 not having seen the rink in years, they'd be “shocked – the growth has been phenomenal.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team also changed dramatically over those years, reaching the Stanley Cup final in 2007 before going into a tailspin a year ago in which multiple veterans and its coaching staff were dumped. Much to the surprise of everyone from management to local media to the players themselves, the Senators of today are a playoff contender again under new coach Paul MacLean. Four players – captain Daniel Alfredsson, Erik Karlsson, Milan Michalek and Jason Spezza – were voted to the all-star team, rather more than should be the team's due but an example of what this team that never should have been has come to mean to Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years the Senators fought to get the all-star game to this facility, but the hitch was always lack of enough convention space to hold the other events of the weekend. That was solved this past year with the opening of the new Ottawa Convention Centre on the banks of the Rideau Canal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one unavoidable complaint that has stuck fast since the rink first opened on another January night in 1996 is traffic. But even that is going to change, with two new lanes to open over the next couple of years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may hurt the ratings for the postgame radio shows, but Ottawa fans will cheer the changes as loudly as, these days, they cheer the team itself.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are moments in the world of travel writing that require the word “magic,” and witnessing the aurora borealis is one of them. Iridescent yellow and green sweeps of light swirling in the cold midnight sky is, simply, unforgettable. The cost of travelling north, however, can put a damper on the moment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make it more affordable, sign up for seat-sale alerts with airlines that fly to the Northwest Territories capital. This includes First Air (firstair.ca), Canadian North (canadiannorth.com), Air Canada (aircanada.com) and WestJet (westjet.com). Then find a hotel that suits your budget – search spectacularnwt.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Anyone can see the lights; all it takes is patience,” says Julie Warnock of Northwest Territories Tourism. For a night of DIY viewing, she suggests packing a Thermos of hot chocolate and renting a car to get outside the city lights. (Pop into the Northern Frontier Visitor Association – northernfrontier.com – for directions to local viewing spots.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or you can sign up for a night-tour: Dene-run North Star Adventures (northstaradventures.ca) offers an “Aurora Hunting” expedition for $55 in which a guide will drive you to favourite spots and share the aboriginal beliefs behind the phenomenon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warnock suggests planning to stay at least three or four days to increase your chances for clear skies. NWT Tourism calculates that there's a 90- to 100-per-cent chance of seeing the display on clear nights between January and early April, thanks to Yellowknife's flatter, less-cloud-covered terrain and its position under the “Aurora Oval” that encircles the North Magnetic Pole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local operators can show you unique ways to enjoy the Northern Lights – from the enclave of a wilderness lodge with Enodah Wilderness Travel (enodah.com), or from heated tepees outside</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yellowknife with Aurora Village (auroravillage.com). Companies such as Yellowknife Outdoor Adventures (yellowknifeoutdooradventures.com) can offer airfare and hotel packages. Plus, local guides can keep you busy in the daylight with trips to the ice road, aboriginal beading workshops or dogsledding, as well as provide or rent the deep-cold gear needed to enjoy the winter waiting in comfort.

But though she succeeded on so many levels, her sport of freestyle skiing killed her. It is difficult to make sense of that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada loves its Olympians, and the 29-year-old was a true Olympian. She did not accept limits – not for girls or women, and not for sport. She was so good at her sport of half-pipe (a type of freestyle in which a skier flies off a curved lip upside down) that the X Games, a competition of extreme sports, was obliged to let women compete in it. And she won four gold medals. She even helped push the Olympic Games to include half-pipe skiing for the first time at Sochi, Russia, in 2014. She was a favourite to win gold. The sport belonged to her the way a sport sometimes belongs to its best athlete.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tough? She had broken her back, her ribs, her nose, torn knee ligaments. “Part of the game,” she said. It's a horrible toll for a game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She always came back. A skiing magazine wrote that she “doesn't just take crashes, she takes spectacular, bone-shattering, nose-breaking, concussion-inducing wipeouts on a consistent basis.” A filmmaker specializing in skiing, Murray Wais, said he knows no other athlete, female or male, as “tough as Sarah.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She wasn't fearless, though – she was scared. “Of course! But I like being scared and pushing my limits. I like the challenge and the risk,” she said. So she was brave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was an innovator. “She was always one to stand in the face of adversity and say, ‘Why not?'” said Peter Judge, head of a national freestyle group. Innovators don't accept limits, and that is how the limits are breached.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this in an era that is increasingly safety-conscious – the era in which concussions in sport are beginning to be taken seriously. But in hockey, many of the concussions are preventable. People take gratuitous shots at the heads of others, who in turn take shots at their heads. In freestyle skiing, the risks, which are at least as unforgiving, are from nature and oneself. Ms. Burke lived for her sport, which is still young and may yet, we hope, find safer approaches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A world without innovators is inconceivable. Ms. Burke couldn't be anything else, even after all those broken bones. She was an ordinary person who did extraordinary things, pushed the limits and died doing so. It is hard to make sense of the loss of such promise to a game.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allison Moore at Open Studio</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until Feb. 18, 401 Richmond St. W., Suite 104, Toronto; openstudio.on.ca</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every once in a (too long) while, one stumbles upon an exhibition that is so relentlessly cheerful, so buoyant and full of bonhomie, that one has to ask oneself why the bulk of contemporary art on view is so decidedly otherwise. Bloated profundities sell, I guess (see end paragraphs).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Micropolis 2.0, a paper sculpture/installation by the Montreal-based printmaking/multimedia duo Arthur Desmarteaux and Allison Moore, crams the tiny exhibition space at Open Studio with enough life, colour, clever sight gags and goofily deadpan urbanity to make one forget that the world outside is in a meteorological deep freeze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The set up for Micropolis 2.0 is simple enough. A narrow shelf runs along three sides of the gallery cube, trimmed with digitally and/or screen printed cardboard backdrops of well-known Canadian streetscapes (Boulevard Saint Laurent in Montreal, Toronto's Kensington Market). The “sidewalk” space is populated with everything from nervous cartoon raccoons to smiling trees to photo-realist cops on bikes to alien hipsters to streetwalkers. And that's not the half of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The detail in Micropolis 2.0 is stunning. Any one of the dozens of strolling figures could stand alone, so to speak, as a work in itself, and all are animated, figuratively and literally, by an R. Crumb-esque sense of naughty (but never depraved or despairing) humour. Noses are elephantine, teeth shark sharp, legs insectile and flesh tones parakeet flashy. Each character – human, animal, alien or plant – is delineated in sharp, but never cutting, never cruel, twitchy black outline, betraying a doodler's freehand sensitivity to the immediate as well as an editorial cartoonist's eye for a subject's frailties as well as flair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the urban topography, the familiar buildings and shops culled from civic centres, is also teeming with life – figures pop out of windows, fly over the rooftops, and perform erotic dances (care of a tiny video screen) in store fronts. I defy any viewer to find a lifeless centimetre in this installation, a moment's pause in the surreal parade. Busy is just too small a word for Desmarteaux &amp; Moore's aesthetic. Effervescent works. So does genius, madcap genius.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jean Bridge at Red Head Gallery</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until Jan. 28, 401 Richmond St. W., Suite 115; redheadgallery.org</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around the corner at Red Head Gallery, Jean Bridge provides an (unintended) counterpoint to Micropolis 2.0's bouncy flâneurism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bridge's video installation, Around the Block, projected in three parts, explores, close up and in slow motion, the areas between urban hot spots – the commonplace wire fences, concrete barriers, hedgerows and wrought iron, the brick backs of buildings and the weedy patches of green.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These lovingly filmed sub-spaces – invisible-by-design, connective links that allow the urban wanderer to rest his/her senses and then more easily move between destinations – are indistinct and primarily functional, meant to go unrecognized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, for Bridge to film such spaces as if she was making a National Geographic documentary about a rain forest or the Himalayas is not only gently subversive, but also just plain weird. Good weird.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contrary to all the urban-planning-speak above, Bridge is not attempting to romanticize the mundane, not falling into the trap of overseeing a dull subject. Rather, Bridge's projections instill a kind of summery calm, a leisureliness that will be familiar to anyone who likes to stroll without a goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Bridge's occasional injections of people into her scanned spaces, via low-res green screen, function as a reminder that even in the most abandoned urban locales, one is never truly alone. As pointed out, in neat parallel, in Micropolis 2.0, even the trees are whispering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Desmarteaux and Moore celebrate the hallucinatory appeal of a city's pedestrian traffic, Bridge meditates on the dreamy, happily undemanding alleys, passages, and microclimates. Same coin, two sides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's hoping a smart curator will put these artists together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marc Audette at Gallery 44</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until Feb. 11, 401 Richmond St. W., Suite 120; gallery44.org</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wanted to like Marc Audette's Art Class 010, a series of photo-based works and an installation at Gallery 44 – and, as pure eye candy, his imagery is unquestionably appealing. Everything I like is present in his exhibition: vivid colour, performance-derived images, an inherent theatricality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's an unwanted tone to the show, one of self-importance. The work presents itself as far more profound than it actually is, and that kills the buzz generated by Audette's otherwise impressive staging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Audette poses sexy models on top of, around, or coming out of a banged-up table with a hole cut into it, then lights them in lurid purple, lime and cobalt. Sometimes they are entangled in white fabric, or have lengths of police tape attached to their limbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's all very circusy, very Québécois. La danse et la vie … etc. Why, then, do the models look like they're about to be executed? Why is the lighting so menacing? Why is the table photographed as if it's a butcher's block?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These images, derived from play and experiment, present the opposite – melodrama and academic frigidity. Lighten up, already.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If anyone can talk his way into the White House, it should be Newt Gingrich. A former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Mr. Gingrich has made a career of thinking on his feet. What is remarkable, then, is that it was Mitt Romney who scored the damaging blows during Thursday's Republican debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gingrich began strongly, winning a standing ovation while addressing his ex-wife's claims he once asked for an open marriage. The debate host led with a question on the subject, and Mr. Gingrich melodramatically shot back, “I am appalled that you would begin a presidential debate on a topic like that,” winning viewer sympathy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He certainly towers over the likes of Rick Perry, the Texas Governor who suspended his own campaign for the presidency this week and endorsed Mr. Gingrich. Mr. Perry's campaign was fatally damaged by his cringe-inducing mental block during an earlier debate, after he declared he would eliminate three government agencies, then couldn't name the third one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, however, Mr. Romney had Mr. Gingrich on the defensive. On one occasion, Mr. Romney turned a question from Mr. Gingrich on how he was a job-destroyer, not a job-creator, into a rousing defence of capitalism and a self-narrative in which he helped create more than 100,000 net jobs – as a man who had spent time in the private sector, unlike his competitor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Romney also took Mr. Gingrich apart for his habit of portraying himself as the virtual architect of the Reagan revolution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You're mentioned once in Ronald Reagan's diary,” said Mr. Romney. “In the diary, he says you had an idea in a meeting of young congressmen, and it wasn't a very good idea, and he dismissed it. That's the entire mention. And I mean, he mentions George Bush a hundred times. He even mentions my dad once.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many commentators have deplored the flawed collection of candidates for the Republican nomination. While Mitt Romney is, of course, not perfect, and has sought to accommodate his policies to the Tea Party and other radicals in his party, he stands out as a plausible candidate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The caveat for this week's phone interview with Liam Neeson was “no personal questions.” But there's a brute parallel in the biographies of Neeson and his latest film character that demands at least one.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his new drama The Grey, which opens Friday, Neeson plays Ottway, an Alaskan oil-pipeline employee who's grieving his beloved wife's untimely death. Sadly, Neeson's own wife, the actress Natasha Richardson, died suddenly after a skiing accident in March, 2009. So though The Grey is an adventure pic – in which a plane carrying pipeline workers crashes in the tundra, and the small band of survivors must outwit a pack of ravening wolves – Ottway's hollow-eyed pain looks real.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I steel myself to ask: Was it difficult to play a man mourning his wife? But Neeson answers readily, without objection. “Not in the least,” he says. “That was part of the reason I was attracted to it. I thought, ‘I can access this man's emotions with ease.' It was kind of a cathartic experience, actually.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the thing about Neeson, 59, which I learned the first time I interviewed him, in 1993, for Vanity Fair: He can be intimidating. He stands 6-foot-4 and sports the big hands and battered nose of a boxer – which, growing up in Belfast, he was. He's not thrilled about the celebrity game of selective revelation, and not shy about saying so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That first interview took place over three days, on the set of Rob Roy in Scotland. When I arrived, it was wet and cold, and Neeson was shooting a scene where Rob was being dragged by horses down a muddy road. An assistant ushered me into Neeson's trailer, where I was to interview him between takes (a hard way to get a conversation flowing). I waited. And waited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without warning, the door banged open, and Neeson huffed in, covered in mud, fake blood and matted hair extensions, snorting like a dray horse, steam rising from his wool shirt and kilt. Too tall to stand upright in the trailer, he loomed over me, picked up a copy of Vanity Fair that lay on a table and flipped to a profile of Tom Cruise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an accent as meaty as Irish stew, he said, “Cruise talks about his father, to a journalist,” pronouncing that last word with the same sneer one might use to utter “Peeping Tom.” “Why would anyone ever tell anything personal to a journalist?” He crashed down into the seat opposite me. “So what's your first question?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things continued this way for two days, me trotting after him, him growling responses when caught. Then on the third day, when we finally got some time for a proper interview, I learned another thing about Neeson: He can also be wonderfully convivial, full of charm, telling jokes on himself, calling me (and everyone else) “darlin' ” and delivering anecdotes with a tinge of poetry. When I left Scotland, he clasped my hand in both of his, and when the story ran, he phoned me at home. “I was a right bastard sometimes, and you could have stuck it to me,” he admitted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, even in a short phone call, I could see that pattern was still in place. There was some evasion. Neeson's not keen to talk about his off-screen life in New York City, or his two sons, who are 14 and 15, other than to say that he's “their chauffeur” for tennis, hockey and soccer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was some lyricism. “The first day of filming [The Grey], in Smithers, B.C., it was minus-35, and I'm lying in the snow in only a sweater,” Neeson says. “It was almost surreal. It was so visceral, the wind blowing. That image will stay with me for quite a while.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story “appealed to the little boy in me,” he continues. “I get fed up with plots that are driven by someone constantly getting information on a computer. In this, everything had to come from the characters – man versus the challenge of the wilderness, and versus his inner demons. It touches a bit on Moby-Dick and Jack London. I loved that literature when I was growing up. It distills life down to its essence, makes you question your reason for being on the planet in the first place.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there was some self-deprecation. About the relentlessness of the wolves in The Grey, Neeson says, “Of course we know real wolves would keep as far away from mankind as possible. But it's like Jaws – is it a great white shark? Yes, but it's more than that. Same with our wolves. They're kind of mythological.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neeson's career has long mixed Oscar bait (Schindler's List, Gangs of New York) with popcorn flicks (Star Wars: Episode I) and roles that call upon his kingly stature (The Chronicles of Narnia, Clash of the Titans). (He swears he had no idea that his Titans line “Release the Kraken!” would become a catchphrase.) But lately he's zeroed in on fathers or father figures who are men of action – what a colleague calls “mad dads” – in movies such as Taken, The A-Team and Unknown. There's lots of corralling his inferiors, roaring at bad guys and chomping on cigars. And there's more to come: He recently completed the sequel, Wrath of the Titans, and played an admiral in Battleship (based on the board game); he's in the midst of shooting Taken 2 and did a comedy sketch for Ricky Gervais's show Life's Too Short.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neeson likes the lighter stuff, he says: “It's great to be able to do it. It's terrific. You have to see it for what it is, and play to that. Don't play against it. Just try and keep it frothy. Don't be afraid of it.” He laughs. “As long as my knees hold up. I'll be 60 this year. Nowadays it takes a bit longer to recuperate.” For The Grey, he insisted on doing many of his own stunts, even plunging into a freezing river three times. “It was something I had to do,” Neeson says. “You had to know it was me, and not a cheat.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have no desire to play King Lear or Hamlet,” Neeson sums up. “I never had a grand ambition. I just followed my nose. I left Ireland because I thought, ‘Right, I should be in London now.' Then after a while I thought, ‘Right, this is drying up, I want to do more film work, so go to Los Angeles.' A little inner voice every few years would tell me to go, a little wind of change would happen, and I would follow it.” He chuckles. “It seemed to work out,” he says. Then, with a final “Take care, darlin',” he slips away again.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nathan Cullen, an NDP leadership candidate from northern B.C., put matters well: The candidates, he said, “violently agree” on just about everything. When candidates agree, it's great for party unity. But it means the contest is not much about policy differences but rather about style, nuance, geography, organization and, dare we say it, electability.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other parties always worried more than the NDP in selecting leaders about electability, or who could carry the party to office. NDP leaderships were never about which candidate might actually become prime minister. Candidates sometimes talked about what they would do at 24 Sussex, but nobody took them seriously. Now, who knows?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conservatives will have been in office for about a decade when the next election rolls around. Here's what recent history shows about the longevity of governments. Pierre Trudeau won in 1968 and lost in 1979. Brian Mulroney won in 1984, successor Kim Campbell lost in 1993. Jean Chrétien won in 1993, successor Paul Martin lost in 2006. At about the 10-year mark, parties either lost power or were about to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's way too early, of course, to speculate on the outcome of the next election. But it's not too early for the opposition to dream. Now that the NDP is the Official Opposition, the fairy tales no longer seem utterly fanciful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cullen has impressed a lot of people with his good humour, acceptable French and environmental preoccupations. As the only candidate from B.C., he should be the province's “favourite son,” which would count for a lot in a province with perhaps 35,000 NDP members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would seem, however, that the provincial party machine has lined up for Brian Topp, the former party president who's the classic backroom boy-turned candidate. Mr. Topp, with the backing of former federal leader Ed Broadbent and former Saskatchewan premier Roy Romanow, is deemed to be one of two front-runners, the other being Thomas Mulcair, an MP and former deputy leader from Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But who really knows what's going on? Yes, the candidates are having weekly debates. But since they agree on just about everything, the debates are hardly gripping affairs. How could a serious debate occur among eight candidates in 90 minutes, even if the candidates were inclined to debate as opposed to agree?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only a small minority of NDP members will attend the debates or watch them on television or social media. Many more will be meeting the candidates as they roam across the country. The candidates' goals at this stage are to meet, greet, impress and sign up as many members as possible before the deadline for memberships expires in about a month. It's an organizational marathon more than anything else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a twist to this NDP leadership contest that could be consequential. Those who vote will do so by preferential ballot. When the candidate who finishes last drops out after the first ballot, his or her supporters' next preferences will be allocated to the other candidates. And so on, until one candidate gets 50 per cent of the vote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So being a second choice becomes very important, since none of the candidates are expected to be near 50 per cent in the first round. It's conceivable with preferential voting that, if the two front-runners' supporters can't abide the other front-runner – Mr. Topp's backers can't bring themselves to favour Mr. Mulcair, and vice versa – then perhaps someone else could sneak between then with a harvest of second choices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps that might be Peggy Nash, who's from Toronto, bilingual and has lots of union support. Or Paul Dewar, an Ottawa MP who's got lots of support from Manitoba's provincial NDP. Or perhaps Mr. Cullen, although that would be a long shot, indeed. Or maybe Mr. Topp and Mr. Mulcair, both bilingual and from Quebec, will have lots of supporters in that province for whom both candidates would be just fine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this stage, speculation is just harmless fun. In a race where all “violently agree,” excitement is at a premium. Selling memberships is where it's at, for now.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little more than two years ago, Dalton McGuinty set an ostensibly high standard for ministerial accountability.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It didn't matter that David Caplan bore less responsibility for the mess at eHealth Ontario than his predecessor, George Smitherman. Mr. Caplan was the Health Minister when the scandal over contracts and expenditures broke, and was judged not to have done enough to prevent it. So he was dumped from cabinet, never to return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on that precedent, the woman who replaced Mr. Caplan should be feeling pretty nervous about now. The controversy at Ornge, the province's air-ambulance service, bears a striking similarity to eHealth in the way it has unfolded – an ambitious system reform implemented in some haste under Mr. Smitherman that has blown up in a successor's face. In some ways it might actually be worse, since the current controversy goes beyond business practices to life-and-death questions about the quality of emergency services. But the early signs are that, while she's in for an unpleasant few weeks or months, Health Minister Deb Matthews will keep her job. And Mr. McGuinty will be left trying to talk his way around a cruel reality of politics – that different ministers are subject to different standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Caplan, although well-liked by many of his colleagues, was considered dispensable by the Premier. Despite his senior posting, he was never quite in the top rung of cabinet, and he wasn't central to the government's plans. Although he had files that he tried to move forward – notably, and admirably, mental health – he was something of a placeholder. Ms. Matthews is a different story. In fact, with the exception of Finance Minister Dwight Duncan, she's the one front-bencher Mr. McGuinty can't afford to lose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Matthews has been tasked with flattening health-care spending increases at about 3 per cent annually – a monumental challenge that's central to the government's hopes of eliminating its $16-billion deficit. Largely based on trouncing the province's pharmacists in a fight over prescription drug costs, the Premier's office is convinced she's the minister best suited to winning necessary battles with vested interests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even beyond her own portfolio, Ms. Matthews plays a pivotal role in her party. Along with Municipal Affairs Minister Kathleen Wynne, she carries tremendous sway with the Liberals' centre-left. And Mr. McGuinty is counting on her to help get buy-in, including from many of her cabinet and caucus colleagues, for the government's austerity agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, of course, Mr. McGuinty won't just come out and say any of this. And that's going to place him in a very difficult position if, for instance, ongoing investigations show any conflict between the air-ambulance agency's non-profit, public operations and its private ones – not to mention if other investigations show deficiencies in emergency responses. Amid allegations that Ms. Matthews was warned about problems with Ornge and didn't take sufficient action, how will the Liberals explain why Ms. Matthews gets to keep her job, when Mr. Caplan didn't?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In part, it appears, they will do so by trying to direct blame toward Mr. Smitherman – something they stayed away from during the furor over eHealth, when he was preparing to run for mayor of Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Smitherman didn't win any friends earlier this month when he wrote to the Toronto Star accusing his successors of failing to oversee or even understand Ornge's operations. And while Mr. McGuinty hasn't publicly criticized his former minister, other Liberals have been increasingly willing to take potshots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals will also try to draw a distinction between eHealth and Ornge, by noting that the latter functions far more independently than the former, and thus lends itself less to ministerial oversight. And to some extent, they'll just wait until we start talking about something else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the reasons Ornge has got so much attention lately is that the government hasn't been making much other news. That will change within the next few weeks, when the release of economist Don Drummond's public-service report kickstarts a tumultuous budget process. Next to the spending decisions to come, controversy over an agency that receives $150-million annually may seem like small potatoes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it's highly unlikely that opposition politicians will be able to resist calling for Ms. Matthews' head when the Legislature returns next month. And since Mr. McGuinty gave them their pound of flesh last time, it will be hard to blame them.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can actually see it – maybe even smell it: peeling turquoise paint, probably containing lead, broken windows, graffiti, smells like bleach and pee.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(And before you say it, I am in no way implying anything negative about my full-time employer, the CBC, which, while it is often referred to as “the public broadcaster,” I am very proud to work for, and which is not only not substandard, but hardly ever smells like pee.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the Wikipedia blackout was lifted, I have learned that the word “public” comes from the Latin word for “toilet.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who knew?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I thought it came from “populous,” for “the people” – specifically people who share a common interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the word “community,” which includes people who not only share a common interest, but interact as a result of that interest. Think commune, communist, communion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For me, it brings to life visions of cotton-clad hippies in wire-framed glasses scratching their beards and exchanging cleanse recipes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So imagine my surprise when I set eyes upon my neighbourhood's new community centre, which opened to the public this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growing up, I learned quickly that community centre meant “place where people with no money go.” I have a faint recollection of viewing a tattered 16 mm print of The Ghost and Mrs. Muir at the Sandy Hill Community Centre in Ottawa. I remember little more than the mayhem: the shouts of children in a darkened room, the “shushes” of mothers, the clickety-clack of the rickety old projector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The community centre was the place where pottery met poverty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where unwed teenage mothers on welfare congregated to learn how to do the impossible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where disaffected young people in faded Adidas T-shirts played Ping-Pong until closing time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Physically they were unremarkable, squat buildings fashioned of the kind of brown brick that would have made architects of Soviet-era housing projects nod with familiarity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emotionally, they should have been full of hope and optimism, given their stated goal. But often sadness and desperation hung in the halls. It was a place for people with no place to go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My new community centre (mine, because I've already taken ownership) opened this week at Trout Lake. It has taken more than two years to build and has been much anticipated by the community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My new community centre is vast and beautiful, all curves and asymmetrical lines, carved of concrete, glass and aluminum, with an entrance that practically begs you to come inside. It is the latest in a new wave of grand community centres that have up sprung up across the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years ago the Sunset Community Centre opened its doors to murmurs of, “This is a community centre?” Bing Thom designed it; its roof is supposed to mirror the topography of the park in which it is located.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new Creekside Community Centre, a 2010 legacy project on the former Olympic Village site, is a LEED platinum building, and it's hard to beat the location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hillcrest Aquatic Centre, also leveraged out of hosting the Olympics (though not cheaply), is attracting visitors from across the Lower Mainland. Not a surprise: It is spectacular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can argue that priority has been granted to centres that grabbed Olympic money the fastest, or that politics has somehow influenced how quickly certain community centres will make it to the capital plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can be cynical about a lot of things in this city, but walk through the doors of one of the new facilities, and some of that cynicism will surely melt away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are a handful of pretty community centres enough to redeem the idea of “public,” so that the word no longer conjures up visions of the substandard? It's a start.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two people named Redford have sharply differing opinions about Barack Obama's decision to block the contentious Keystone XL oil pipeline, which would have run from Alberta down to Texas. The obscure Redford (Alison, the Premier of Alberta) is “bitterly disappointed,” while the famous Redford (Robert, the Hollywood celebrity) is ecstatic. He calls it “a victory of historic proportions” against “one of the most nightmarish fossil fuel projects of our time.” Whose side you're on may say a lot about where you live and who you voted for.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For environmentalists, the decision is a long-overdue down payment on Mr. Obama's campaign promise to wean the U.S. from its dependency on oil. But it's much more than that. It's a stand against the rape and pillage of the planet by greedy corporate interests that have politicians in their pockets. These environmentalists don't really care about safety matters such as oil leaks or possible pollution of the aquifers. It's the oil sands they hate – the water-gulping, forest-devastating, carbon-spewing monster that's despoiling Mother Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hero and spiritual leader of the crusade to stop Keystone is a mild-mannered writer named Bill McKibben – like Mr. Obama, a graduate of <span class="companylink">Harvard</span> who's spent his life in the cultural world of upper-middle-class progressivism. He got his start writing short pieces for The New Yorker. His best-known book is the immensely influential The End of Nature, an eloquent polemic arguing that human influence has irrevocably altered the planet for the worse. Like David Suzuki, his comrade-in-arms, Mr. McKibben believes we have a moral imperative to tread more lightly and burn less fossil fuel. He lives in rural Vermont and, according to a sympathetic profile in this Sunday's Boston Globe magazine, has a wood-fired hot tub.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years ago, Mr. McKibben decided he had to organize. So he founded a group called 350.org, whose name is based on the claim by climate scientist James Hansen that any atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide that exceeds 350 parts per million is unsafe. (It's currently about 385 ppm.) They've called the proposed pipeline a “1,500-mile fuse to the continent's biggest carbon bomb.” If it gets built, they warn, “it's game over for the planet.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or maybe not. In the larger scheme of things, Keystone isn't that big a deal. Energy expert Vaclav Smil says the entire Keystone system would move just over 6 per cent of current U.S. crude oil consumption. The new pipeline would add just 1 per cent to the quarter of a million kilometres of existing oil pipelines that criss-cross North America. “Why, if pipeline safety is a key concern, have we not seen waves of civil disobedience?” he asked in a recent commentary. As for the biggest objection to Alberta's “dirty oil” – the fact that it produces more carbon dioxide than other oil sources – he says that, in 2010 alone, China's carbon dioxide emissions rose by 780 million tons. That's more than 40 times the annual emissions of all the oil that'd flow through Keystone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other side is not exactly a hyperbole-free zone, either. “The President is selling out American jobs for politics,” thundered House Speaker John Boehner, who also warned that, by cancelling the pipeline, Mr. Obama is effectively exporting energy security to China. But the pipeline's job-creation potential has been considerably exaggerated. As for selling Canadian oil to China, we'll be into the next decade before it happens (if ever).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the value of Keystone as a symbol is much higher than its value as a pipeline. The only reason it's an issue is that it crosses the U.S. border, meaning that it must be approved by the State Department. For this reason, it has locked Mr. Obama and the Republicans into a high-stakes political game. Mr. Obama first tried to boot the decision past the election. Then the Republicans used legislative sleight of hand to force a decision on him; many hoped he'd turn it down, giving them a big stick to beat him with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama says that he made a technical decision, based on the fact there wasn't enough time to review the environmental impact, and that <span class="companylink">TransCanada Pipelines</span> can try again. He figured he was both shoring up his environmental creds and giving Republicans the finger. But the Republicans' calculation is correct: Politically, he handed them a win. In states where people have built livelihoods on manufacturing and resource extraction, folks don't much care for environmentalists who went to <span class="companylink">Harvard</span>. They care far more about jobs than about global warming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These same cultural dynamics will also shape pipeline politics in Canada, pitting the urban elites of Toronto and Vancouver against the kind of people who vote for Stephen Harper. But aboriginal groups (and land claims) probably will be the biggest obstacle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, a new energy boom has broken out in the United States. As companies tap into vast new reserves of shale oil, thousands of new jobs – far more than the pipeline promised – are being created in Texas, North Dakota and Ohio. On Tuesday, the day before the Keystone decision, the President's Council on Jobs called for aggressive “all-in” expansion of gas, oil and coal production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Keystone, much of it probably will get built anyway – just not, for now, the bit that goes over the border. <span class="companylink">Harvard</span> may have won the battle. But the heartland is winning the war.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney switched tactics (if not bodies) in the critical final hours before South Carolina's potentially game-changing Republican primary. The Freaky Friday dynamics illustrated how the Romney cakewalk has turned into a food fight.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The normally garrulous Mr. Gingrich, who got a standing ovation for venting his spleen at the media in Thursday's debate, was a study in Romney-like restraint and discipline. He did not want to “pop” – as Rick Santorum warned he might if he ever got to the Oval Office. Mr. Romney, perhaps sensing his Plan A path to the GOP nomination sliding out from under him, took to making Gingrich-like, below-the-belt attacks on his rival. He evoked Mr. Gingrich's ethics violations and the caucus mutiny that cost him the Speaker's job in the late 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He was pushed out of the House by his fellow members,” Mr. Romney said. “Over 80 per cent of Republican congressmen voted to reprimand the Speaker of the House.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the polls are right, each candidate has a nearly equal block of GOP voters behind him going into Saturday's primary. But Mr. Gingrich may have the edge with the exit of Texas Governor Rick Perry from the race and his momentum with anti-Romney voters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If he loses, Mr. Romney's aura of inevitability evaporates. He will face a historic challenge that may take more than his considerable money and organization to overcome. Since 1980, no Republican has won the nomination without winning South Carolina.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Red-meat Republicans are solidly behind Mr. Gingrich. They do not buy polls predicting their candidate would get creamed by President Barack Obama in the fall. They believe he would ride strong debate performances all the way to the White House, using language as a weapon of Democrat destruction just as Mr. Obama once used it as a tool of seduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pragmatists are for Mr. Romney. They seem to care only about the economy and putting a Republican in the Oval Office. They are more discreet than Gingrich supporters, but they harbour no illusions about the need to attract centrist voters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transformation of the race into a neck-and-neck battle between Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich leaves South Carolina's normally powerful social conservatives with a choice to make on Saturday. They can play kingmaker or stick with Mr. Santorum, the ex-Pennsylvania senator who won the backing of evangelical leaders. Polls show many have already made the move, but Tommy Plonk is not one of them. The 64-year-old title searcher from Columbia said he felt Mr. Gingrich has a “weak” moral core and is “too much of a rationalizer” in explaining away his past failures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Mr. Romney, Mr. Plonk said he considered him a “very, very honest, upstanding and dependable person.” But his religion is a deal-breaker. “As a conservative Christian, we strongly feel the Mormons are misguided in their teachings.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nancy Corbin, a 66-year-old retiree who favours Mr. Santorum, is no fan of Mr. Gingrich. But she said she would find it easier to vote for the ex-Georgia congressman, a fellow Southerner, than for Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He may be a Republican but he's not our kind of Republican,” she said of Mr. Romney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joyce Lovell, 82, of Beaufort, S.C., had been “on the fence.” But her choice crystallized after the debates. “At first, I thought Romney might have the best chance” against Mr. Obama, she offered. “But after seeing Newt in action, I think he would be stronger. He would fight.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She dismissed as “a lot of baloney” the claim by Mr. Gingrich's ex-wife that he once sought an “open marriage” so he could keep a mistress on the side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gingrich's response, during a CNN debate on Thursday night, will go down as perhaps the most brilliant play to the party base in modern Republican history. He turned a potentially crippling attack on his moral character into a reason to vote for him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By blaming the “destructive, vicious, negative nature of much of the news media” for complicating the business of governing, he was able to express believable indignation at the moderator for bringing up such “trash” at the outset of “a presidential debate.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don't normally vote in primaries. But I have to admit I think Newt's response was great,” said Mike Refieuna, a 42-year-old Charleston wine salesman. He said he would cast a ballot on Saturday, for either Mr. Gingrich or Mr. Romney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The only thing that bothers me about Romney is this tax thing,” he added, referring to Mr. Romney's muddled debate reply about releasing his tax returns. “It's kind of like Barack Obama's birth certificate. Just release it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Mr. Romney may have wasted the crucial days before the primary fending off repeated calls to release the documents now. It took him off his jobs message in a state that needs them far more than most.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he could pay the price for it well beyond South Carolina.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not long after Christy Clark became B.C. Premier, Dimitri Pantazopoulos, a pollster tied to Stephen Harper and his Conservatives, packed up his family, left Ottawa and moved to Victoria.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pantazopoulos family is spending their first winter there. The kids are settling in, they bought a puppy and they are marvelling at the temperate climes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the move wasn't for lifestyle. Mr. Pantazopoulos, who worked with Stephen Harper in the early days of the Reform Party and has polled for right-of-centre candidates, was lured west by Premier Clark, a Liberal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initially appointed her principal secretary on the strength of the voter tracking he had conducted for her successful leadership bid last year, he is now focused on interprovincial relations. Ms. Clark is also minister of that portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, last week, Ms. Clark named another former Harper conservative and strategist, Ken Boessenkool, as her chief of staff. He starts next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the relocation of two former strategists does not a trend make, their ascension to key roles in the B.C. Premier's office certainly indicates that after having turned political Ottawa blue, Mr. Harper's brand of conservatism is being exported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When it comes to people staking out bold positions, and saying ‘we've got to do this pipeline' or ‘we've got to do this about health care,' it usually comes from Quebec or now the West,” says Rick Anderson, a director of the Manning Centre for Building Democracy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Anderson has a unique perspective – one of the first Ontarians to join the Reform Party ,he later became a top aide to Preston Manning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's knows both Mr. Pantazopoulos and Mr. Boessenkool – and the way Reformers think.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What they bring in common is a preparedness to think outside the box, to ask the more profound questions, to challenge political convention or … correctness,” he says. “They are braver about putting public policy choices on the table … a lot of things that used to be taboo to talk about are not taboo any more.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years ago, Mr. Boessenkool moved to Calgary from Ottawa, where he is working as a consultant. That had included lobbying for Calgary's <span class="companylink">Enbridge Inc</span>. in 2008 and 2009, which could pose a problem in his new job, given the proposed Northern Gateway oil pipeline project in B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had an earlier relationship with Ms. Clark and it was he who brought Mr. Pantazopoulos to Ms. Clark. The two men have worked together in conservative politics since the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Ms. Clark, their presence is critical, given that the B.C. Liberals are a coalition of the centre and centre-right aimed at keeping the NDP out of power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Clark government is not only threatened by NDP Leader Adrian Dix but also by former federal Conservative MP John Cummins, who is now the head of the B.C. Conservative Party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it's helpful, for example, that Mr. Manning, the former Reform leader who knows Mr. Pantazopoulos, has already been in to talk to Ms. Clark's caucus about what it takes to win. Mr. Manning is certainly supportive of Ms. Clark, as are former Harper B.C. cabinet ministers Chuck Strahl and Stockwell Day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there are the connections to the PMO and Harper caucus that Mr. Boessenkool and Mr. Pantazopoulos provide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, one can detect Mr. Pantazopoulos's hand in the PM's attendance last week at an atom league hockey game in which Ms. Clark's son, Hamish, played.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harper stayed for the entire game, which was an unexpected surprise. It gave Ms. Clark important face time with the Prime Minister in advance of her health-care meeting with the premiers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No surprise she is supportive of the Prime Minister's new and controversial formula for health-care transfers, which some premiers criticized. She likes that the federal government is not dictating to her on what is a provincial responsibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the hockey game ended in a tie: 4- 4. There were no losers on that day.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's about the only thing that could put the succinctly named Stop Online Piracy Act, known as SOPA, in a positive light. Support for both the PROTECT IP Act, usually called PIPA (you know it's a problem when your acronym needs an acronym), and SOPA dropped dramatically in Congress during Wednesday's website-blackout protest by Wikipedia, Reddit, Boing Boing and numerous other sites.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Rubio did not fall like a Domino car, or the character from The X-Men, or the pizza chain, or the 1977 Atari arcade game.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No, these politicians fell instead like a row of the gaming pieces that make up a set of dominos (sometimes called a deck or pack), which is one of a number of tile games played worldwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each of these possible entries from Wikipedia's disambiguation for the word “domino” was written by someone professing to have knowledge of that subject; each entry is reviewed and edited by others professing the same thing. Citations are requested and given, or the request is left pending until it has been met.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you've never done it, find an entry on Wikipedia on a single, narrow subject and observe it over several weeks. In all likelihood, that entry will change, and sometimes it will be changed back, often within minutes. Usually it will be embellished with intriguing minutiae and links will be added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Wikipedia entry often unfurls with a method that is at once naive and yet miraculous to behold, like watching a pea planted in a Dixie cup on a sunny windowsill of a Grade 2 classroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wikipedia, flawed but delightful, is a venture that few would have predicted could succeed. It was born of risk and imagination in a largely unfettered Internet, and it would be a far different beast if SOPA were to pass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A single link on any website, even in a comment, to something copyright-infringing, or to something that someone claims infringes copyright, or a link to something that no lawyer could argue against but that happens to be hosted on the same site as something that someone claims infringes copyright would mean that your site could potentially be blocked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, SOPA wouldn't just harm non-profits like Wikipedia. Who would have invested in <span class="companylink">Google</span> knowing that one link to the wrong website could shut the whole thing down? The policing and legal costs that would burden every website they did not kill off would be passed on to the consumer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine if every cartographer were responsible for any crimes being committed in the places he charted – to which he, essentially, created links. There would be a lot less exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would be the online world under SOPA and PIPA. The Internet's culture of contribution and connection would be decimated. The Net would be unrecognizable, except that of course there would still be pirates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pirates, whether they are boarding your ship and taking your pieces of eight or downloading your big-budget films and making their fortunes by selling them to others, don't obey the law (remember, copyright-protection laws already exist). Making the lives of a lot of other (admittedly sometimes seafaring) folks more constrained, litigious and generally less creative isn't going to guilt one single real pirate into suddenly becoming a decent, hard-working longshoreman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, what might work – if the aim of these bills is really to curtail the amount of illegally viewed films and television shows, and not to preserve outdated business models, or to allow governments more control over the Web – is facilitating better access to more legal viewing. This is a process that has been, I would say, suspiciously slow.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to movie-awards season. If Christmas is a time for generosity and love, the season now upon us is the antidote, bringing an open display of vanity, envy, avarice and greed, served up with generous lashings of silk crepe and mutual self-congratulation. Is there a time that Hollywood is ever more thoroughly its frothing, pestilent self than in the lead-up to the Oscars?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in order to have a credible awards show, there is also the pesky issue of competition. While Hollywood is naval-gazing by nature, it also instinctively acknowledges the need for an occasional outside opponent – preferably foreign, funny and unthreateningly fluffy – to justify its annual victory lap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enter The Artist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wait, let me guess. You saw it last weekend and you absolutely adored it. The dancing, the mugging, the old-timey feel. All of it was just so darn cute! And that dog – what a little firecracker he was, better than Lassie. A silent movie about the silent-movie era with silence as its “central theme.” It doesn't get deeper than that, does it? Best of all, it's a film from France with no subtitles (although there are a few title cards), which means moviegoers can feel erudite without having to work too hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As you may have surmised, I'm not one of the growing legions who have been “transported” or “captivated” or even “pleasantly diverted for 100 minutes” by Michael Hazanavicius's tale of a silent-movie actor left in the dust by the arrival of talkies. Nor do I think, as half the critics in the free press seem to have asserted, that it deserves to win best picture at the Oscars, let alone all the BAFTAs, Golden Globes and film-festival awards it has already won. (I make an exception for the well-deserved Palm Dog that international critics awarded Uggie the terrier at Cannes.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Artist was a sweet little picture with a clever gimmick, but the characters lacked emotional veracity and the plot was predictable and precious. The 97-per-cent positive “tomatometer” rating on the Rotten Tomatoes website, which aggregates critics' opinions, seems a bit much, especially when far more ambitious flicks such as Shame and The Descendants clock in only in the 80s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what's going on here?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Artist isn't a dog of movie; it's just an exceptionally overrated one. And the reasons shine a light on much of what's wrong-headed and self-delusional about our culture of film appreciation, especially as Hollywood awards season kicks into high gear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly every year, for the past several years running, a film has emerged, usually in the run-up to the Oscars, that is leapt upon, first by the critical press, then by the sophisticated movie-going public, as the Alternate Choice to whatever star-studded, hotly anticipated Hollywood fare is on offer. (This year, The Descendants, J. Edgar and War Horse stick out.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's nothing wrong with an outside contender, but inevitably these films, which tend to be foreign, lower(ish)-budget and starring kooky, accented non-Americans, attract more hype than they reasonably deserve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, we had the amicable The King's Speech – a movie that at least offered some insight into a significant historical figure, and featured a couple of great performances. But in years past, the role of Alternate Choice has been played by such truly slight films as Slumdog Millionaire, Amélie and Life Is Beautiful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not saying these movies were terrible – just that they weren't nearly as good as their attendant astronomical hype. Now that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has expanded the number of potential nominees for best picture (from five to 10 in 2009; and as of this year, to anywhere between five and 10), more Alternate Choices are required to fill the slots. Hence, more fluff from afar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have no problem with films from elsewhere. As a Canadian, how could I? But I do have a problem with the cutesy, cuddly, heavy-on-style, light-on-content foreign fare that seems to win big, at the box office and the Oscars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would a dark and brooding character study such as Martha Mary May Marlene – about a woman's tenuous escape from a cult leader who specializes in rape – have a snowball's chance of getting nominated had it been set in Italy rather than New York State? What if Shame were about a Chinese sex addict, instead of one played by Michael Fassbender? I know I'm tossing out hypotheticals, but the point is: We tend to recoil from challenging foreign films and to overpraise slight ones, to the detriment of our cinematic culture as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After reading the reviews for The Artist, I thought I was in for a life-changing screen experience. What I got instead was an hour and a half of pep. I'm all for choice. But wouldn't it be nice for the Alternate Choice to subvert, rather than simply affirm, our expectations of what a good movie should be?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But awards season is upon us – and the die is cast. The Artist will sweep the Oscars. And then we'll forget all about it. Why? Because the emperor not only has no sound. He has no clothes, either.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most colds last about seven to 14 days, so for a cold that has persisted for more than a month, I would recommend seeing your doctor to review your medical history and do a physical examination. Depending on your symptoms and personal history, he or she may be able to suggest some options for relief and ensure that nothing serious is happening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's possible you have developed a secondary infection. Secondary infections, such as sinusitis, ear infections or pneumonia, can arise when the immune system has been busy fighting the first infection. While this can happen to anyone, people with weakened immune systems, such as those with uncontrolled diabetes, people in hospitals or nursing homes and those taking immunosuppressant medications are at higher risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the usual runny nose and congestion of a cold, symptoms of possible sinusitis, ear infection or pneumonia include: facial pain, fever, ear pain and shortness of breath.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is important to note that smoking can also decrease immunity, so during a cold (or permanently if possible), reduce or quit smoking to allow your body's immune system to be fully functional. Excessive stress can also weaken your system, so ensure that you are taking care of yourself with plenty of rest, healthy diet and proper hydration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On occasion, a cold can worsen pre-existing conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD or emphysema), or congestive heart failure. If you suffer from any of these conditions and your cold continues beyond a week or two, seek care quickly to prevent a prolonged and potentially more serious infection.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Kathryn O'Hara, then president of the Canadian Science Writers' Association, wrote an extraordinary letter to Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the leaders of the other national parties.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that document – remarkable because it was written in a leading democracy not a paranoid dictatorship – she pleaded with government to unshackle its scientists by allowing them to speak freely with the media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CSWA represents more than 500 science journalists, publicists and authors in Canada. Ms. O'Hara recounted a series of incidents that occurred during the year leading up to her letter in which requests for interviews with researchers had been bluntly refused by public affairs handlers, or thwarted by them through endless bureaucratic delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kristina Miller, a Department of Fisheries and Oceans scientist who has done groundbreaking work on emerging salmon diseases on the West Coast, was one of those who was denied permission to talk to the media, even though her research had just been published in the prestigious international journal, Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's stifling of Dr. Miller was so extreme that she was even told by DFO officials not to attend workshops at which experts were discussing salmon issues, out of fear media might attend and hear what she had to say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We urge you to free the scientists to speak – be it about state of ice in the Arctic, dangers in the food supply, nanotechnology, salmon viruses, radiation monitoring, or how much the climate will change,” Ms. O'Hara wrote. “Take off the muzzles and eliminate the script writers and allow scientists – they do have PhDs after all – to speak for themselves.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government did not change its policy. The sandard operating procedure still requires that all media requests for interviews be vetted through public affairs officials in Ottawa. Sometimes, scientists are cleared to speak – often they are not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contrast that with the “scientific integrity policy” adopted last month by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NOAA's new guidelines – which make it clear scientists can speak about their work any time, to anyone – flowed from a memo President Barack Obama sent to the heads of executive departments in 2009. In that missive, he affirmed his support for transparency in government and urged directors to foster a culture of scientific integrity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The public must be able to trust the science and scientific process informing public policy decisions,” he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Science, and public trust in science, thrives in an environment that shields scientific data and analyses from inappropriate political influence,” John Holdren, assistant to the President for science and technology stated in a later memo. He said the purpose of the initiative was to “strengthen the actual and perceived credibility of government research.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NOAA's response is an explicit policy that states “scientists may speak freely with the media and public about scientific and technical matters based on their official work without approval from the public-affairs office or their supervisors.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy guidelines inform staff that if they wish to go beyond talking about their research, and express opinion, they have two choices. They can submit statements of opinion to NOAA's legal and legislative affairs staff which may, after a lengthy process, issue it as government policy. Or they can simply put on the record that they are speaking as individuals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We all have the right to express our opinions publicly on our own time as private citizens. … Thus, your second option is that you will just need to provide a disclaimer indicating you are expressing your opinion and not the opinion of NOAA,” the agency guidelines state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk about being unshackled. All a scientist has to do to express a personal view related to his or her research is to say, “this is my opinion, not government policy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The policy is now in force in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada, government scientists who want to talk to the media still have to get permission from public-relations officials, who can silence anyone they want.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Obama made clear, such an approach calls into question the integrity of science – and the credibility of government.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You'd be forgiven if you thought the happiness of a Twinkie is all in the childhood memory. Food and memory are closely intertwined as anyone who finds comfort in eating their mother's apple crisp knows. For many, news earlier this month that Hostess Brands (the makers of Twinkies and other snacks such as Ho Hos, Sno Balls, Ding Dongs, Suzy Q's and Zingers) had filed for bankruptcy protection was like learning that a childhood friend was deathly ill. Twinkies accompanied them through episodes of Gilligan's Island perhaps. Or maybe they always showed up in their lunch box or waited for them on the counter when they came in from their paper route.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the pleasure of the snack goes beyond the memories it triggers. Twinkies are injected with more than oily cream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you look at any food, its history and what it means changes over time,” says Ken Albala, professor of history at California's University of the Pacific and author of several books on food, including Beans: A History.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In the fifties, Twinkies became a quintessential food of modernity – something that was clean and white and sterile. People understood it was junk food but they didn't understand why it was awful. It didn't have a negative stigma.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Novelty is happiness, in other words.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then with the trend of healthy eating, Twinkies became bad. Still, that brought its own kind of pleasure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Twinkies became the quintessential mass-manufactured ersatz food,” Prof. Albala says. “It's the very symbol of a food that people shouldn't eat because it's so bad, and in reaction to that a lot of people thought, ‘Well, I'm going to eat it anyway.'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's happiness to be found in being subversive, as we know.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But let's not forget Twinkies' invitation to bite into a slice of American culture, once revered and now ridiculed – “middle-class, really boring, WASPy, American conservative families. Like Beaver Cleaver,” as Prof. Albala points out. “They're the exact opposite of ethnic food, which is interesting and soulful. … Twinkies are the complete icon of bland America.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consuming them is a statement in kitschy irony – a very urban, non-middle-American thing to enjoy. (Just in case you've any doubt as to their ironic clout, remember that Twinkies had a cameo in the famed seventies sitcom All in the Family. In one episode, Archie Bunker berates his wife, Edith, when she didn't put some Twinkies in his lunchbox. “It's the white man's soul food,” he deadpans.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help digest the real (and perverse) pleasure of a Twinkie, here are some notes on the snack that's been called “the perfect postmodern artifact.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• In 1999, along with Ray Charles's sunglasses and a map of the human genome, Twinkies were put forward for inclusion in the Millennium Time Capsule to be opened in 2100. They were called “an enduring American icon.” Alas, a concern about mice derailed the plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Lewis Browning was dubbed the Twinkie King of the World – thanks to the myth-making machine of Hostess. The 89-year-old retired milk truck driver ate at least one Twinkie a day for 61 years – a habit that puts his consumption of Twinkies over 22,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• It all began with a fellow named James Dewar. In the '30s, he had the brilliant idea of making better use of his shortcake pans. Up until then, he had used them only during the summer to make shortcakes with fresh strawberries. But what if he shot the cakes full of gooey cream filling? He got the name from a billboard in St. Louis advertising Twinkle Toe Shoes. Original price: two for a nickel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Twinkies has a cookbook all its own. You, too, can learn how to make Twinkie sushi. It involves green fruit leather and dried mango as garnish. Who said Twinkies didn't have sophisticated, up-market aspirations? Or was that recipe ironic, too?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Homer Simpson may have said you cannot harm a Twinkie. But, officially, it has a shelf life of 25 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• In his book, Twinkie, Deconstructed: My Journey to Discover How the Ingredients Found in Processed Foods are Grown, Mined (Yes, Mined) and Manipulated into What America Eats, Steve Ettlinger discovered 39 ingredients in one Twinkie. Among them: corn dextrin, a cornstarch and thickener that in other uses is a glue found on the back of envelopes. There's also cellulose gum, which gives the cream filling its smooth texture. “It's in a lot of low-fat salad dressings, ice creams, and it's used in rocket fuel to give [it] the slightly gelatinous feel,” he told ABC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Twinkies have spawned other scientific investigations. Roger Bennatti, a science teacher at George Stevens Academy in Blue Hill, Me., left an unwrapped Twinkie on his blackboard for 30 years to “marvel at the miracle of [its] engineering.” It dried out but didn't fall apart. He even thought it might still be edible if someone dusted it off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• In 1979, the “Twinkies defence” became part of American legal lexicon during the trial of Dan White, a San Francisco supervisor accused of murdering Mayor George Moscone and Harvey Milk, a fellow worker. The defence team argued that Mr. White was not fully responsible for his actions because he was depressed, as evidenced, in part, by his “bingeing on Twinkies,” according to a psychiatrist. The result? A lesser charge of manslaughter rather than murder. That some people consider Twinkies criminal took on a whole new meaning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who would have thought that a Twinkie could contain so many cultural bits and pieces? Maybe Hostess should reconsider its marketing strategy if Twinkies return after the company restructures. Forget the idea that the snack is simply a return to mindless, happy childhood. There's so much more for the consumer to chew over. Embrace its cultural complexity! Start a campaign of mindful Twinkie eating! Sell it as 80 years of weird and wonderful happiness in one very bland white cake.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Question</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have the world's best family doctor – she listens, gives great advice, calls me personally to follow up and keeps updated on the latest technology. Her administrative assistant is vile: She is disorganized, impatient and consistently rude, and her English-language skills are basic. Each time I call, it feels like I'm just a nuisance. Do you have any tips on how to deal with a difficult secretary? Is it inappropriate to complain to my doctor about her office staff?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Administrative staff at doctors' offices can range widely – from pleasant to overly protective to downright irritable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some field two dozen calls a day from an anxious, sometimes angry, public, trying unsuccessfully to locate a physician who is willing to take new patients. They have to contend with a packed waiting room. So demanding are some patients, they seem impossible to satisfy. And then there are those who speak to office staff in a way they would never talk to their physician. All that can make for a cranky receptionist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So yes, the job is stressful but that does not excuse her behaviour, which sounds unprofessional and unacceptable. Chances are, you may not be the only patient who has encountered her vileness – as you call it – and your physician will be glad you brought it up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Roper, chief of primary care division at the McGill University Health Centre in Montreal, recommends you raise the issue with your physician at the end of your next medical visit. Say something like: “May I raise a concern?” then get into it. Tell your physician she has a wonderful office, is a great doctor – of course, only if that is true – but that you are concerned about the behaviour of her receptionist. Essentially, you want to start with an affirmative statement before getting into the difficult bits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In preparation for that talk, analyze your own actions. Ask yourself: Am I the only one the receptionist seems angry with? Am I requesting too many things? You mentioned your physician calls you personally. Could it be that the receptionist is trying to protect the doctor's time because the physician doesn't do it herself?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most doctors typically only call patients at home when there is an unusual circumstance. Ask yourself: Can I solve the question I have for the doctor by just making an appointment?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In answer to your question, it is appropriate to talk about the office staff to the physician. And trust me, you do not want to confront the receptionist. Be prepared, though, to discover that you may be part of the problem.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All-star hiatus comes just as Habs are picking up some momentum to keep their slim playoff hopes alive</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">NHL</span> all-star break is a not-so-welcome sight for the Montreal Canadiens. A week ago, yes, just about every player would have welcomed the chance to get out of town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, talk about your season from hell. It wouldn't have been much longer before the media would have been calling for the firing of the janitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, though, there is a spark of hope. Just a spark, mind you, considering the hole the Canadiens dug for themselves. But getting three out of four points in back-to-back games on the weekend, topped by a brilliant stretch of goaltending by Carey Price in a 3-1 win over the listless Toronto Maple Leafs on Saturday, sparked some dreaming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble is, the Canadiens don't play until Wednesday, against the Detroit Red Wings, and then they're off for five days until they play the Buffalo Sabres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> playoffs, thanks to the three-point games, is all about getting on a roll and riding it as hard as you can.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Things look a little brighter,” forward Lars Eller said. “We've still got more than 30 games to go [in the season]. We're keeping the faith in this locker room.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be quite a leap of faith to see the Canadiens ascend to even the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. After 48 games, they have 45 points, which is barely within hailing distance of the playoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To guarantee making the postseason, an Eastern Conference team will need at least 93 points and more likely 95. To get 95, the Canadiens need a mere 50 points in their last 34 games, which requires a nifty 25-9 record or 23-7-4 or an equally unlikely combination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We can't let anything bother us,” Price said when the size of the Canadiens' task was mentioned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, considering the way Price is playing these days, capped by his 32-save performance against the Leafs, you might think the Canadiens have a shot. Unfortunately, there is a goal-scoring component to this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a group, the Canadiens have scored 123 goals in 48 games so far, an average of 2.56 a game. The only East teams to score fewer are the New York Islanders, Buffalo Sabres and Florida Panthers. Only the Panthers are in a playoff position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is little chance of a sudden scoring explosion in sight, given that the Canadiens' leading point producer, winger Erik Cole, has 36 points, followed by Max Pacioretty with 33. Even the Islanders have three players with 40 points or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadiens will find out quickly after the all-star break if they have any chance of making a move. They play the Sabres, New Jersey Devils, Washington Capitals and the Jets. All of those teams except the Sabres are in front of them so even one loss will be deadly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So all those Canadiens fans on the Internet forums with an eye to the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s entry draft calling for them to finish last overall still have lots of hope left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">********</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIVE GAMES TO WATCH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blues at Red Wings</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Central Division fight among the St. Louis Blues, Detroit Red Wings and Chicago Blackhawks is the best one in the league. Blues head coach Ken Hitchcock, above, is also fighting it out with Ottawa Senators counterpart Paul MacLean as coach of the year. Monday, 7:30 p.m., TSN2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senators at Kings</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The aforementioned MacLean leads his Senators against the rejuvenated Los Angeles lads in Game 4 of their five-game trip. If you want to skip work for some reason on Tuesday, this would make a good back end of a doubleheader. Monday, 10:30 p.m., Sportsnet East.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senators at Coyotes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As noted above, this is the return of Ottawa centre Kyle Turris to Phoenix, the team he could not wait to leave. Given the size of the Coyotes' crowds, the boos will not be deafening. Tuesday, 9 p.m., Sportsnet East.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruins at Capitals</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless you have the <span class="companylink">NHL Centre</span> Ice package, you'll have to head for your local to see this one. But the Caps are showing signs of life so it might be worth it and chances are you won't have to listen to Bruins play-by-play shill Jack Edwards at your pub. Tuesday, 7 p.m., NESN.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">NHL</span> all-star game</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This game was listed just to tell you this: If you watch it, turn in your hockey fan card immediately. Sunday, 4 p.m., CBC, RDS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All times Eastern</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIVE PLAYERS TO WATCH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s general managers gathering at the all-star game in Ottawa this week, trade talks will heat up. Here are five forwards certain to be discussed:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bobby Ryan</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Anaheim Ducks winger is the prize of the group but general manager Bob Murray may not be inclined to trade him now that the Ducks are winning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ales Hemsky</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Inconsistency is headed toward unrestricted free agency. The Edmonton Oilers winger is tempting to someone who thinks a change of scenery will get him going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vaclav Prospal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He'll be 38 in February and is also headed to free agency but unlike Hemsky, Prospal of the Columbus Blue Jackets is a consistent producer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuomo Ruutu</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now we're getting to the remainder bin. The Carolina Hurricanes forward is probably a little better than the rest of the names known to be in play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Stafford</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has three years left on his contract at $4-million (U.S.) a season, which is terrible value for his point-every-two-games pace. But the Buffalo Sabres winger is 26 and has some talent, so someone desperate might be tempted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*******</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MAPLE LEAFS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto, on the other hand</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the Montreal Canadiens, the Toronto Maple Leafs could use the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> all-star break. Not that it allows head coach Ron Wilson much time to fix a team that looks like it could fritter away its season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The streaky Leafs showed all of their warts in losing 3-1 to the Canadiens on Saturday, the second time in three games last week they lost a game they should have won. The warts are all too familiar to their fans – an indifferent defensive game and an indifferent work ethic that made it look like the Leafs were a team that had already checked out for the break even though back-to-back games with the New York Islanders are ahead on Monday and Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actually, Wilson said, he and his assistant coaches will be working at both ends of the ice this week in what little practice time they have before the break begins Thursday. Canadiens goaltender Carey Price played well but the Leafs forwards made it too easy for him, the coach said, and the Leafs made too many mistakes in front of their own goaltender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We didn't get to the front of the net and screen him. That's something we have to work on,” Wilson said. “You have to pay a price in an ugly game. We didn't create enough traffic.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of the players most in need to defensive lessons will be at the all-star game, where defence is just a rumour – wingers Joffrey Lupul and Phil Kessel. They were reunited in the third period Saturday when Wilson was trying to find some scoring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lupul, who missed a chance to clear the puck on the Canadiens' winning goal, finished minus-3. At least he is plus-2 for the season. Kessel is even. Neither mark is impressive for a team's two best players even if they are among the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s best scorers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">********</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ONE BOOK TO READ</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a public service, the staff here at The <span class="companylink">NHL</span> Lookahead has a much better way for you to spend Sunday afternoon instead of watching the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> all-star game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First of all, a confession of bias: The fellow who wrote the book we're going to recommend is a friend. But Gare Joyce is also pretty handy at putting words together, as noted in a favourable review a few days ago by The Globe and Mail's Margaret Cannon. “Good to the final paragraph,” was the judgment of Cannon, so we're not pumping a buddy's tires as they like to say in hockey dressing rooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> all-star game, The Code is a fictional look at hockey. But unlike the all-star game, Joyce's story of a grinder-turned-scout, Brad Shade, and his attempts to solve the murder of a junior hockey legend while preserving the jobs of himself and his boss, The Code, from Penguin Canada, is thoroughly entertaining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joyce (whose moniker is G.B. Joyce on the book for some reason, thanks to one of the Penguin suits) presents a realistic take on the world of professional hockey, realistic enough to studiously avoid the use of <span class="companylink">NHL</span>, in order to keep the league's lawyers at bay. He also has some fun with the names of his characters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is the corpse, for example, of one Red Hanratty, a coach whose legend outstrips the reality, and whose name must have come from a perusal of the Hockey News archives from before the First World War.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our favourite name is Billy Mays, senior and junior. Junior is a talented young player and the progeny of one of those detestable businessmen whose relentlessly upbeat approach is driven by slogans. Just like an infomercial pitch man.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although quite properly equivocal, Washington-based Foreign Policy magazine and London-based Legatum Institute, a free-markets think tank, nevertheless asserted earlier this month – in launching a new website called Democracy Lab – that 2012 could turn out to be the year “in which the forces of democracy triumph around the world.” There are plenty of reasons why it won't, Democracy Lab concedes; yet, there are plenty of reasons why it might. Either way, it says, the global transition to democracy will almost certainly quicken.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Democracy Lab proclaims 2012 “the year of elections.” By year's end, says foreign correspondent Christian Caryl (now a senior fellow at Legatum), “the citizens of 59 countries – one-third of the world's countries – will have gone to the polls to choose national, state and local leaders.” This year, he says, will confirm the fact that an overwhelming majority of Earth's inhabitants implicitly accept the principles of democracy as the global standard to which all people aspire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1945, the world boasted 12 democracies. It now boasts 115 of one sort or another. The Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index classes 25 of them as “full democracies,” 53 as “flawed democracies” and 37 as “hybrid regimes.” The Economist index measures democracies strictly on electoral credibility: on “full and fair” elections, on the security of voters, on the competence of the electoral bureaucracies; on improper foreign influence. Among the world's “full democracies,” it ranks Norway first, Canada eighth, the United Kingdom 18th, the U.S. 19th – and Mauritius, the island republic off the southeast coast of Africa, 24th. In some ways, of the 25 “full democracies,” Mauritius is now the most notable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elections are obviously only a prerequisite to democracy. The Arab Spring has produced the one but not yet the other – although Mr. Caryl notes that an Islamic party governs in a coalition with two secular parties in Tunisia, a model perhaps for other Middle Eastern countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Yet even under the most daunting of conditions,” Mr. Caryl writes, “we can see that the hunger for dignity remains a powerful magnet.” The democratic insurgency keeps spreading: Russia, Venezuela and Myanmar, where the government has released from house arrest the heroic democrat Aung San Suu Kyi, who will contest a parliamentary by-election on April 1. Even the harshest of dictatorships, Mr. Caryl says, must prepare for democratic surprises – China, for example, and Iran (which goes to the polls, and perhaps to the streets, in March).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democracies are messy, imperfect things, and Western countries themselves don't always get it right. The Economist's Democracy Index lists such advanced countries as France (29th) and Italy (31st) under “flawed democracies” (they both finish low because of unsustainable public-sector spending).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, every new democracy remains a cause for celebration. This is why Mauritius is important. This little country (population: 1.2 million) is the wealthiest, best-governed country in Africa. The World Bank put it first in its ranking of African economies (and 20th worldwide). The Mo Ibrahim Foundation ranked it first in its Ibrahim Index, which measures African countries based on rule of law, human rights, human development and economic opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More instructive still is the ranking of Mauritius in the Index of Economic Freedom published by the Washington-based Heritage Foundation and The Wall Street Journal. In 2010, this index put Mauritius in 12th place (out of 179 countries); in 2012, it elevated the country to eighth place (with a score, out of 100 points, of 77, only two slots behind Canada's 79.9). It was the first time an African country had placed in the index's top 10 – and it did so by surpassing the United States (in 10th place with a score of 76.3).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mauritius is a small multiracial country that has practised free-market economics for years – and now has top 10 rankings in both democratic governance and economic performance. The economy expanded by 4 per cent last year, and average incomes increased to $14,000 (U.S.). (China, incidentally, ranked 138th and Russia 144th.) Economic freedom is as much a prerequisite for democracy as voting. Let's hear it for the prosperous little democracy with a dodo on its coat of arms.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A defiant Republican base let out what a former ally termed a “primal scream” in picking Newt Gingrich in the South Carolina presidential primary. But will GOP voters elsewhere join the chorus or recoil in horror at the prospect of the pugnacious ex-speaker carrying the nomination?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gingrich's massive victory in Saturday's vote, besting onetime front-runner Mitt Romney by 12 percentage points, did far more than resuscitate a candidacy given up for dead only days earlier and transform the GOP race into perhaps one for the history books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It further inflamed the tension between an aging and palpably angry grassroots, which relishes a Republican flamethrower at the top of the ticket, and a GOP establishment that sees Mr. Gingrich as an excitable hothead who would lead the party to a historic defeat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also reignited worries about whether Mr. Romney, who spent last week reeling from one miscue after another, has the political skills to take on President Barack Obama. It even prompted renewed discussion among party powerbrokers about drafting a consensus candidate, such as former Florida governor Jeb Bush, to carry the GOP banner this fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outcome in South Carolina leaves both Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich with plenty to prove as the Republican contest shifts to Florida, which holds its primary on Jan. 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gingrich must dispel impressions – widely cultivated by former House colleagues – that he is unreliable and undisciplined. He must show he can do battle in a more diverse state than South Carolina without an organization to match Mr. Romney's arsenal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Romney must demonstrate that he has more than money and consultants behind his campaign. He needs to show that he can channel the antipathy of the party base toward Mr. Obama as well as Mr. Gingrich, and establish a more visceral connection with voters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gingrich, who has spent more than three decades in Washington as a congressman and political consultant, spent the morning after his big win casting himself as the candidate best placed to take on the party elite ensconced in the capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The establishment is right to be worried about a Gingrich nomination,” the former speaker told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday. “I'm happy to be in the tradition of Ronald Reagan as the outsider who scares the Republican establishment and frankly after the mess they've made of things maybe they should be shaken up pretty badly.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But former Florida congressman Joe Scarborough, who was among those who led the caucus revolt that ousted Mr. Gingrich from the speakership in 1998, shot back against his former boss in a separate interview on the same program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scarborough called the South Carolina vote a “primal scream” by the grassroots. But he warned the party base was wrong to see in Mr. Gingrich its natural hero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Newt is not a conservative. <span class="companylink">Google</span> it!” bellowed Mr. Scarborough, now an MSNBC host. “He uses this resentment, the politics of grievance, to actually hide a record that you can really identify very quickly on <span class="companylink">Google</span>.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Mr. Gingrich has flip-flopped at least as much as Mr. Romney on everything from climate change and tax increases to health-care reform and abortion rights. But he has used his innate talent for wedge politics – illustrated in his constant depiction of Mr. Obama as a “food-stamp president” – to connect with grassroots Republicans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, for every flourish of rhetorical brilliance that Mr. Gingrich has produced in his career, there are plenty more examples of verbal diarrhea. The Romney campaign is dearly hoping he develops another case of it before Florida Republicans vote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two debates this week, on Monday and Thursday, will provide Mr. Gingrich with plenty of rope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is never more rhetorically reckless and dangerous to himself than when he is on top. He betrayed not an ounce of humility in any of his appearances Sunday on all of the major U.S. political talk shows – except This Week on ABC, the network that ran last week's interview with his ex-wife – and left pundits awestruck by his bluster.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA -- jibbitson@globeandmail.com</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Did the Obama administration's decision not to approve the Keystone XL pipeline damage relations with the Harper government? The short answer is no, and proof of that comes Monday, when International Trade Minister Ed Fast will announce the extension of the softwood lumber agreement in Washington.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agreement, which Canada and the United States signed in 2006 – after years of acrimony, countervails and court actions – expires in 2013. Rather than repeat an unhappy chapter in Canada-U.S. relations, both sides have chosen simply to extend the existing deal until 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Harper was deeply disappointed by Barack Obama's decision not to approve the oil pipeline from Alberta to the Gulf. But those who are close to the matter say the Prime Minister has written off the President's rejection as a temporary setback forced on the administration in an election year – that political adviser David Plouffe had more say in the matter than Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. After the election, assuming Mr. Obama is still President, Mr. Harper hopes and expects he will come around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As if to demonstrate its good intent, the word from the Obama administration that it was ready and willing to sign an extension on softwood came hard on the heels of the pipeline rejection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most important, the implementation of the Beyond the Border agreement announced in December – which seeks to improve both border security and access – is unaffected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But relations between the two countries will face a bigger test in the months to come, as Canada looks to the United States for help in getting this country a seat at what has turned into the world's most important trade table: the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the year is out, nine Pacific countries – including the United States, Chile, Australia and Malaysia – are expected to conclude a sweeping free-trade agreement that will open the economies of all to all. Negotiations have gone so well, and the implications for the agreement are so far-reaching, that Japan and Mexico now also want in. So does Canada, but the Harper government foolishly missed an earlier opportunity to join the discussions by insisting that supply management, which protects Canadian dairy and poultry, be kept off the table. The other countries showed us the door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, belatedly, Canada has decided it is willing to join the talks without preconditions. The feeling in Ottawa is that the final agreement will no doubt protect American and Japanese (if they join) farmers, and Canadian farmers will get an exemption too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Australia and New Zealand, especially, fear that new arrivals showing up brandishing new demands could wreck, or at least seriously delay, the agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the Harper government is hoping the United States will support Canada's accession to the talks, and will lobby reluctant members on this country's behalf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stakes are enormous. The Conservatives have slowly come to realize that Canada's future prosperity depends on deepening trade ties with fast-growing Pacific nations. The TPP is the best way to cement those ties. But we are late arrivals to this party, and not particularly welcome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is why Mr. Harper plans to personally lobby other TPP leaders at the World Economic Forum at Davos this week. It is why Mr. Fast plans to meet with all nine counterparts over the next two months. And it is why Mr. Harper needs Mr. Obama to be in Canada's corner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news is that in December Mr. Obama voiced his tentative willingness to see us join the TPP. But Canada will need more from the United States, and soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An extension on softwood is welcome. The setback on Keystone XL is probably just temporary. But it's on the Pacific partnership that Mr. Harper will be asking Mr. Obama to prove he really is Canada's friend.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The need for speed has been everywhere lately and it's claiming victims again in the journalistic world – this time over the reckless speed used by some media organizations in trying to break the death of Penn State coach Joe Paterno, whose legendary career was ended by a child sex abuse scandal. Paterno died Sunday morning of complications from cancer.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not before CBS Sports erroneously used Twitter to announce Paterno's death on Saturday night. The news sped across the Twitterverse, with the Huffington Post posting an obituary and many high-profile journalists adding their condolences. Then, the Paterno family emerged to say that their father was not dead and still fighting for his life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CBS Sports went into apology mode, saying it had relied on an “unsubstantiated report,” adding that “CBSSports.com holds itself to high journalistic standards, and in this circumstance tonight, we fell well short of those expectations.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might say that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How an organization as big as CBS fails to confirm a death with the family is inexcusable. Huffington Post, a liberal website, doesn't have the same resources as CBS, but it only takes one call to check a fact – which Huffington reportedly did not do. (Maybe it was preoccupied by Newt Gingrich winning the Republican primary in South Carolina?)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The haste to be first reminded many here in Canada how the Toronto Star, TSN Radio and other outlets announced the death of former NHL coach Pat Burns in September of 2010. Burns quickly phoned in to say he was still alive. (Burns died two months later.) Speed kills, especially when editors and reporters don't do the most basic fact-checking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As TSN's Bob McKenzie tweeted, “I get desire to report news first but on imminent death, here's a novel concept: why not wait for family or team/league to make it official.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speed bumps</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The death of Canadian skier Sarah Burke from injuries sustained in competition has led many to wonder about an athlete's need for speed and danger. What hasn't been discussed is the role of television in the deaths of skiers and auto racers – as well as in the more devastating injuries in hockey, football and other contact sports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Put simply, TV craves excitement like a skier craves fresh powder. The lens is bored with the ordinary and seeks daredevils to fly faster, higher, farther. To seek new aerial tricks or touchdown catches that defy gravity. To invite spectacular mid-ice bodychecks and drivers who'll run next to the wall at 200 miles an hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an age in which fame on TV is the new panacea, putting yourself (and others) in harm's way is the Express Pay line to recognition. In this, there are many willing takers such as Burke, those who will move closer to the edge on a half pipe to land a new trick. Or those in team sports who will attempt more violent bodychecks and crushing tackles to find their way onto TSN's SportsCentre or Sportsnet Connected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is, after all, no need to push the danger zone. Compelling auto races can still be conducted five miles an hour slower. Football tackles can be made with something less than kill-shot kamikaze intensity by simply wrapping up a runner. Hockey checks can simply take the puck from opponents rather that take out their teeth. But in a desensitized society, that safe stuff is so yesterday. From our couches, we demand the adrenalin jolt from a highlight pack – and TV obliges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burke was a star of ESPN's X Games and was going to be a TV star as the favourite in her event at the 2014 Winter Olympics. To many, it doesn't get much better than that. But as Burke discovered, that notoriety comes with a price tag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moving van</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wondering why CBC chose the Anaheim Ducks and Ottawa Senators game on Saturday afternoon over the terrific 4-3 Vancouver Canucks win over the San Jose Sharks played at the same time? Why wouldn't the Corp. want the game in the larger market and with the Western Conference leaders? Or how about the Boston Canucks-Vancouver instant classic two Saturdays ago? Both were carried on Sportsnet Pacific.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, Hockey Night in Canada has the rights to 14 Canucks games with the option for one other this season. When the schedule was drawn up, Hockey Night opted for more Saturday night games to fill out its doubleheaders. Why? Probably because you can charge advertisers more for the night games than afternoon games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canucks general manager Mike Gillis shrugged off the choice. “We have a good partner in Sportsnet,” he told Usual Suspects. “We got a record rating for the Boston game. We have no desire to be Canada's team. We'll leave that to Toronto. We belong to Vancouver and B.C.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THEY SAID IT / PATERNO REMEMBERED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He died as he lived. He fought hard until the end, stayed positive, thought only of others and constantly reminded everyone of how blessed his life had been. His ambitions were far-reaching, but he never believed he had to leave this Happy Valley to achieve them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paterno family</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"History will say that he's one of the greatest. Who's coached longer, who's coached better, who's won more games, who's been more successful than Joe? Who's done more for his university than Joe? You've lost one of the greatest. He probably means the same thing up there that Bear Bryant meant down here. He's an icon."</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Tsawwassen First Nation is right to have embarked on ambitious real-estate developments, on its lands in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia. In a vote last week, 97 per cent supported this adaptation to the modern economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It amounts to a reversal of centuries of colonialism. This aboriginal community will be the landlords of numerous non-aboriginal businesses and households. It has become – among other things – a capitalist enterprise that will bring into being residential subdivisions with many types of housing, two large shopping malls, and an industrial park adjacent to the port of Vancouver – all this on less than half of the TFN's 724 hectares.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That advantageous location in the midst of a metropolitan area, however, means that the TFN's plan is not a simple recipe for economic development that all other aboriginal communities can easily follow – especially, remote reserves such as Attawapiskat and Kashechewan, both near James Bay, which in recent years have drawn national attention for (respectively) bad housing and a bad water supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the people of Tsawwassen have done what numerous native leaders have advocated for many decades. They have essentially emancipated themselves from the much-hated Indian Act, thanks to their treaty of 2009 with the federal and B.C. governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing on Earth is ideal. The TFN is a quasi-municipal government, in which the 57 per cent of the residents who are not native (a figure likely to rise with the new subdivisions) lack votes, though they are to be consulted – and of course they can vote in federal and provincial elections. Status Indians could not vote in Canada until 1960; the role reversal is a striking irony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the development will add to urban sprawl. But aboriginals should not be denied the fruits of modernity. The Tsawwassen First Nation is to be congratulated for acting on this great opportunity.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listen, there are only three kinds of TV shows.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, there's the show that connects you to the world. Second there's the show that's your comfort blanket in the world. And third there's the show that is the wall between you and the rest of the dumb, mundane world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first category is still often and rather unimaginatively called the “water-cooler” show. As if everybody worked in an office and it was a fact of life that, in every office, everybody gathered around the water dispenser daily to discuss TV shows. Really, it's the show that you have been manipulated into watching on the basis that everybody else is supposed to be watching it and you can make in-person or online comments about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It can also be one of those shows that command audience response, such as American Idol. Or just the show that's new, original and provocative. And much written about. At one time Desperate Housewives was the definitive show in this category. Two and Half Men was it for a while, The Simpsons, once upon a time. Right now there is no such show. The closest equivalents are The Big Bang Theory and Modern Family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second category is what most people watch – shows that are predictable, reassuring in their conscientious adherence to a format.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people will watch Criminal Minds several times a week because the villain is always caught. The characters respond in the same manner in every episode. It's a show that sends you off to bed consoled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other, newer shows that fit into this category and whose seemingly inexplicable popularity is easily explained by their predictable format. Castle (ABC, CFTO, 10 p.m.) is a sterling example. It's preposterous, unimaginative TV, and it's like watching Murder, She Wrote over and over. There's a murder, and while solving the case, author Richard Castle (Nathan Fillion) and NYPD Detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic) flirt, josh and banter. NCIS (CBS, Tuesdays, 8 p.m.) follows the same pattern. It's a huge ratings hit that nobody ever talks about. These shows are antidepressants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personally, I have What Not to Wear and Say Yes to the Dress in this category. It's amazing how relaxing it is to watch families gather to choose a wedding dress for an excited young miss, and make entirely the wrong choice. There's that and Fox Soccer Report, which also connects to the world that matters to me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the third category that's truly interesting and has flourished in a splintered TV landscape. Just as many teenagers gravitate toward some from of superficially rebellious rock music as a barrier against conformity, grown-ups will religiously watch a TV show they believe sets them apart in attitude and taste. These shows aren't necessarily brilliant or original. Often they're smug but offer a heightened sense of superiority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An example is Portlandia, an obscure series that airs in the IFC channel in the United States and on SuperChannel in Canada (the second season starts Feb. 13). A slight satire of life among the hipsters who apparently comprise the entire population of Portland, Ore., it is really a one-joke show. You have to be hip to get the mocking jokes about the hip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet Portlandia recently merited a long feature story in New York Magazine. It was treated like an offbeat but important novel, something that transcends television to be a vital comic statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is no such thing, but watching it makes viewers feel very smart and enjoying it creates a barrier between the viewer and the vast world that is too dumb to understand the ironic humour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American Horror Story is another show in the same category. The pilot episode was visually sumptuous and striking, and then the rest of it didn't make a blind bit of sense. But, as it turned and twisted, spraying mordant humour about sex and death, some viewers whiled away an hour watching it in the belief that it separated them from the lumpen proles watching Castle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Californication (TMN, Movie Central, 10:30 p.m.) has the same cachet. It is simultaneously a show about a jerk, Hank Moody, who wants to have a real father-daughter relationship with his child, and a show about a jerk who has an uncanny ability to make women swoon even as he behaves outrageously. Finding Hank lovable lets the viewer feel superior to uptight people who would condemn his awful behaviour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I put it to you that this is television genres defined. There are only three categories. Everything you watch falls into one of them, doesn't it?</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the first of a four-part series on innovative ways to deliver aid in our conflicted world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dollar donated in foreign aid never translates to a dollar received by deserving people in a poor country.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That dollar has to be siphoned through a system of bureaucracies that chip away at it while trying to transform it into beneficial action. Typically, this action is in the form of a “project,” an organized attempt to target beneficiaries and offer them goods or services. Thus, whether aid improves the lives of people depends on whether a project is well designed, whether the targeted population is selected properly and how efficiently it's implemented. Each is a link in the chain that translates aid into concrete action on the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, there's been a lot of attention on improving project design by evaluating the impact of projects, particularly by using randomized trial methodologies borrowed from the medical sciences. Some attention has also been directed toward how to target the poor. That means defining poverty lines and determining where a household falls by collecting survey data, allowing communities to select poor households based on their own criteria, or some combination of the two methods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While randomized control trials and poverty targeting methods are the subject of heated debate, project implementation – which can eat up to 90 per cent of that dollar – also deserves urgent attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Projects can be poorly implemented for a variety of reasons: theft and corruption among implementing agencies, inadequate budgets for supervision, poor management, poorly trained staff and so on. Smaller “boutique” projects are easier to implement, but they also affect fewer people. For foreign aid to have a transforming effect, it needs to do things on scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But larger projects that affect bigger populations face more variety in the things people need and have less information about local conditions, making them harder to implement. This can result in a number of problems. For instance, the benefits of the intervention may not match the needs of beneficiaries, or the benefits might be diverted to government staff. In addition, the village's rich and powerful may ensure that the benefits stay with their cronies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Poor implementation is often the weakest link in aid effectiveness, and is also the most difficult to fix. That's because implementation problems are deeply embedded within the social and political environment of a country. This leads to some of the most difficult challenges facing development policy – entrenched discrimination and inequality, a culture of corruption and lack of accountability in government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But whatever the environment, there's no question that it's critical to track funds and the performance of functionaries, and assess changes in the lives of beneficiaries. With good monitoring data, project managers can learn when their efforts work and when they fail, and where they succeed and where they don't. This can result in mid-course corrections, shifts in design and a more flexible learn-by-doing approach that's essential to creating positive changes in challenging environments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aid agencies, unfortunately, don't pay adequate attention to data, and often rely on “experiential” information – the experience of senior project managers during their field visits, where all too often they're steered to villages and sites where things are working well. This needs to change. Part of the problem lies in the inordinate need of project managers to report positive news; their incentives are heavily stacked against even the whiff of failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a complex situation, where it's difficult to know how to act, failure is essential to learning. Thus, it can make foreign aid more effective if we pay close attention to monitoring – improving the quality of data, using data to inform project decisions and becoming more tolerant of failure.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year will probably see an increased exodus of Arab Christians fleeing the mounting tide of radical Islam in the Middle East – a phenomenon that, as sad as it is, might bring a surge of new vitality to Canada's thriving immigrant communities. Some of these exiles will choose Canada as a haven, and many of them should qualify for refugee status.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 100,000 Copts have fled Egypt since the ouster of Hosni Mubarak, chased by a series of increasingly violent pogroms at the hands of fanatics while the military often looked the other way. The country's estimated 10 million Copts are the original inhabitants of this land; some can trace their origin to the Pharaonic period. They later converted to Christianity, centuries before the Arab conquest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no doubt their situation will worsen, given the popularity of the Salafists, the hard-line fundamentalist wing of the Islamist movement who gained nearly 25 per cent of the vote in parliamentary elections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iraq already lost half of its million-strong Christian population – driven out by the sectarian infighting that followed the U.S.-led invasion and by terrorist attacks against their churches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next wave of refugees is likely to come from Syria, whose more than one million Christians, an educated and active community, have been under the protection (and thus accused of collaboration) of the Alawite regime – a classic pattern of the secular Middle East dictatorships, from Saddam Hussein to Mr. Mubarak to Bashar al-Assad, that protected their religious minorities while ferociously repressing militant Islamists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's probably only a question of time before the Assad government is overthrown – and then the Sunni Muslims who form the majority in Syria will turn against both the Shia Alawites and the Christians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Egypt, disquieting signs are multiplying. The Salafists, with their surprisingly good showing at the polls, will be a force that the military and the more moderate Muslim Brotherhood will have to reckon with. One of their spokesmen, Abdel Moneim al-Shahat, recently declared that the Pharaonic relics are akin to “blasphemous idols” because they come from a pre-Islamic era, and that the Koran forbids the representation of human figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shahat presents himself as a moderate. We aren't the Taliban, he said, alluding to the destruction of the monumental pre-Islamist Buddha statues in Afghanistan; we'll simply cover the relics with wax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a country where tourism is a major resource, it's unlikely that an Egyptian government would abide by the Salafists' wish. But the Salafists have other goals that might be shared by the Muslim Brotherhood: They want sharia law fully implemented, and they want writers such as Nobel Prize winner Naguib Mahfouz banned for immorality. They've also made clear that no Copt should ever be in a position of power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former Parti Québécois cabinet minister Joseph Facal reports that hotels in Alexandria, a city he's often visited, have stopped broadcasting CNN and the French public affairs network, substituting religious sermons instead. Last month, during clashes between military forces and protesters in Cairo, the venerable Institut d'Égypte, founded by Napoleon in 1798, was set on fire and thousands of documents were destroyed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We'll have a clearer view of what's in store for Egypt when the elections are finished and a new constitution is drafted. But what's certain is that the horizon is darker than ever for the Coptic minority.</p>

Ottawa and the provinces together spend more than $2-billion a year offering government services in both French and English.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the actual ability of the population to speak both French and English remains stubbornly low. While 35 per cent of francophones in Quebec speak English, only 7.4 per cent of anglophones outside Quebec speak French.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., 9 per cent of the population speaks two languages – to say nothing of the European Union, where 56 per cent of citizens can hold a conversation in a language other than their mother tongue and nearly one-third have mastered a third language, according to a new study by the Association for Canadian Studies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are complex reasons for English Canada's ambivalence toward French, among them the regional concentration of francophones, and the rising importance of Asia in the global economy, especially in Western Canada. One-third of people from British Columbia and Alberta think Spanish and Mandarin might be better choices as a second language than French.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet the challenges of Canadian bilingualism may also stem from its association with government legislation. Mastering both of Canada's official languages may be wrongly perceived as an historical anomaly, or an expensive government-imposed obligation. (In fact, there is no official requirement to learn French and English, except for public servants.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, learning a second language should be viewed as a gift to society that confers significant global advantages, and bridges cultural divides. “In other countries and regions such as Latin America and Europe, multilingualism is embraced by the majority, especially for young people, and seen as a way to advance,” notes Jack Jedwab, the study's author.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most Canadians receive second-language instruction in school, but many then lack an opportunity to use it. Through creating more opportunities – and incentives – to speak French, this trend could be reversed. Bilingual employees are more likely to be better paid, especially in Quebec, and in the public sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ability to speak French, English – as well as Spanish or Mandarin – should be seen as a source of pride and as an investment in the future that will yield dividends over a person's lifetime. Canadians should feel blessed – not cursed – to be home to two of the world's great languages.</p>

With money worries, job stress and family obligations vying for our time, it can seem, as the Red Queen puts it, that “if you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly a third of Canadians can relate to the Red Queen. Statistics Canada reports that 30 per cent of people aged 35 to 44 describe most days as stressful. The figure is higher in Toronto (43 per cent) and Montreal (32 per cent), while Vancouver (23 per cent) comes close to its “chillax” reputation.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stress became a mainstream preoccupation in 1980s – the age of big mergers and even bigger hair. But the fears about burnout in the Mulroney-Reagan era seem almost quaint compared with the fully wired tension and dread that many workers face today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arguably, the labour-saving devices and communications technology that promised to reduce effort, increase productivity – and let everyone log in to work from the beach – have only added to the pressures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smartphones are major culprits, according to psychologist Richard Balding at the University of Worcester in England. Although they help people keep on top of work projects, the devices make daily life more stressful because people compulsively check for new messages, alerts and updates, his research suggests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Work demands are not to blame, Mr. Balding found. Instead, smartphone stress arises mainly from the urgency users feel to keep tabs on their ever-expanding virtual social lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not a trivial problem, according to his study of stress levels in 100 smartphone users, including university students, retail workers and public-sector employees. Some users in the study were so hooked that they reported feeling “phantom vibrations” from non-existent text messages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So many people have smartphones now that the effect they are having on their lives and the amount of time they are spending on them is, to be honest, quite scary,” Mr. Balding told the Daily Mail earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He urged organizations to encourage their employees to switch their phones off and cut the number of work e-mails sent after hours to reduce people's temptation to check their devices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, he noted that smartphone use is bound to go up thanks to the endless supply of new apps. Among them is a plethora of stress-reduction widgets designed for smartphone use on the fly. But that's a technological irony for another day.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We want to reduce the carbon footprint of our two cars – one for city use and one for outdoor activities. Do we go with one hybrid SUV, or keep the old one to pull our sailboat and buy a hybrid economy size for the rest?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ANSWER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like all great eco-dilemmas, the right answer… depends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are into number crunching, there are ample online resources to compare mileage, greenhouse gas emissions, and price differences. But our level of mathematical acumen leads us to tell a story:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both of us learned how to drive in a 1988 Ford Probe. Marc bought it used back in his early university days. We ran that trusty car into the ground, but it kept going. The experts at Consumer Reports say it makes financial sense to keep an old car for its natural life before getting a new, higher-mileage one. When we finally saved enough to get our first new car, we went hybrid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We'd like to say we use our hybrid Toyota Highlander for rugged manly adventures, but really it's for shuttling health-supply shipments, educational materials and display boards all over the city and continent. Despite its big size, we were stunned to calculate that it uses about one-third less gas than the old Probe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We chose to drive just the one larger vehicle after considering that we rarely travel without all that stuff in tow, which fits with the mantra of Treehugger.com: Define your needs. The online guide mentions towing boats, saying that if you only do it a few times a year, consider renting or borrowing. You could keep the old SUV if your insurance costs aren't too high, but park it in non-boating months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most significant fuel savings with hybrid cars come in the city, because full-stop and low-speed battery-only modes save a lot during stop-and-go traffic. If you want to get really green, you could try a fully electric vehicle such as the Mitsubishi i-Miev.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether in a gas guzzler or an ultra-low-emission vehicle, your mileage and footprint can vary widely based on how you drive it. Keep a constant speed, coast to decelerate, keep your tires optimally inflated, remove extra cargo, reduce aerodynamic drag like roof racks and avoid excessive idling..</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we'd say go hybrid economy size in the city, get creative for your other needs, and drive smart.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the premiers of all 13 provinces and territories gathered in Victoria. A key item on their agenda was to discuss the future of medicare in light of the federal government's long-term take-it-or-leave-it health financing deal.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By now the details are well-known: Ottawa will increase the Canada Health Transfer – currently worth $27-billion in cash and $13.6-billion in tax points annually – by 6 per cent per annum until 2016 then tie the increases to economic growth (meaning they will be around 4 per cent a year) for another decade. Ottawa will dole out the money on a strict per-capita basis, with no adjustments based on the economic status or demographics of the provinces and territories. (There was an equalization formula in earlier deals.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There will also be no strings attached, meaning the provinces and territories can spend the money as they see fit and that the federal government will no longer try to entice the provinces to tackle common problems like wait times or lack of electronic health records, nor will it use the money to ensure that provincial programs are equitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the meeting there were dire warnings that drastic cuts to health-care delivery would be necessary in some provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others said it could spell the end of medicare as we know it, and so on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is certain is that Prime Minister Stephen Harper has fundamentally changed the federal-provincial relationship in the shared jurisdiction of health care, essentially relegating Ottawa to the role of disinterested benefactor of a decentralized system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The premiers were unanimous that the federal government's decision to unilaterally decide funding was unprecedented and unacceptable,” said B.C. Premier Christy Clark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A crisis requiring firm action indeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premiers huffed about the lack of money Ottawa was offering and they puffed about the feds abdicating their responsibilities. And then they drew in a big breath and mightily declared that … more study was necessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seriously?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of the meeting, having tapped all their collective wisdom, political savvy, economic insight and social policy expertise, the cream of the crop of Canadian politics came up with a hard-hitting response … forming two committees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seriously?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's pray there's some secret plan they're not telling us about because this is pathetic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harper took the 13 premiers to the woodshed – albeit with a velvet paddle – and their response was a vigorous bout of committee forming?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harper is no Chuckles the Clown but he must be laughing himself silly at how easy it was to divide and conquer the provinces and save himself a few tens of billions in transfers in the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a golden opportunity here for the provinces and territories to say: “We have common interests and, despite Ottawa's indifference, we're going to ensure a semblance of a national health-care system remains.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the premiers could have agreed to a set ofcommonstandards for reimbursement of prescription drugs, an area where there are gross disparities between jurisdictions. Creating this kind of national (not federal) program would be immensely popular with Canadians because it would be a de facto expansion of medicare. (Currently there are common standards only for coverage of hospital and physicians services.) The additional cost would be minimal and, with a united front, they could probably shame the federal government into paying for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premiers could have shown leadership on a file that has festered for decades and started the process of dragging medicare into the 21st century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, we got a boatload of platitudes for public consumption and a new reality in health care where the rich provinces got richer and the poor ones got poorer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the fundamental principles underlying medicare – equity and fairness in health-care delivery and funding – crumbling, the premiers are fiddling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We now have a new working group, chaired by Manitoba Premier Greg Selinger, to examine the federal government's new funding formula (even though the federal government says it is not open for discussion). We also have a new Health Care Innovation Working Group, composed of all provincial and territorial health ministers and co-chaired by PEI Premier Robert Ghiz and Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This bold exercise in innovative thinking will focus on only three areas: the scope of practice of health professionals (important but hardly a task for premiers); human resources management (read: Hey guys can we stop stealing doctors and nurses from each other by co-ordinating what we offer them in collective agreements?) and encouraging the development of clinical practice guidelines (another triviality best left to professional associations.) That is work for bureaucrats, not premiers. When the first ministers meet, they should be articulating a vision for the future of medicare, not whimpering like snubbed school children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We don't need more studies or committees. Every royal commission, provincial inquiry, independent analysis for the past five decades has come to the same basic conclusions about what we need to do reform medicare:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Control spending by limiting medicare coverage to essential treatments that work;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Modernize primary care by moving away from solo physician practices to interdisciplinary teams;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Create some kind of universal prescription drug plan;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Shift money from institutional care to home care so we can look after people where they live, in the community and at home;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Instead of spending obscene amounts of money to marginally extend survival of the terminally ill, invest it in palliative care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premiers have six months until their next meeting. In the interim they should be making plans, real plans, for improving medicare – with the money they have (which is about $141-billion in public funds and another $59-billion in private dollars.) There is no magic bullet, least of all more money. The improvement needs to be made, little by little, but that can't begin to happen until there are specific goals and leadership from the top.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We don't need more working groups. We need work to begin. Now. Seriously.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same events that have rocked the financial world are also presenting opportunities for us to exert some control over the cost of living.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Natural gas prices are a good example. They've hit 10-year lows recently thanks mainly to a combination of new production coming on stream, a warm winter and a decline in demand related to global economic weakness. Unless you think we're headed toward a lengthy recession that will keep the price of commodities low indefinitely, now's a good time to lock in a natural gas price for the next five years at a very attractive rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think of a fixed-rate natural gas supply contract like the 10-year mortgages I wrote about last week (tgam.ca/DQJk). You may not get the absolute best price or rate possible, but you do lock in a cost that looks excellent by historical standards. Just as important, you add some cost certainty to your life. One of the most disturbing things about the past few years is how vulnerable we've all become to financial events that are far removed from our everyday existence. The developments themselves are shocking, but so is the feeling of having no control over our lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Locked-in gas contracts and long-term mortgages give back some control. They bring some welcome predictability to your monthly expenses, and that might just help you find room in your budget to lock in or ramp up a regular savings regimen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time there was much buzz about locking in a price on natural gas was in 2005, just after Hurricane Katrina struck the southern United States and shut down a significant amount of natural gas production. There were estimates from around then that natural gas prices could surge as much as 71 per cent, and that had some people thinking about locking in to protect themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This bit of history highlights one of the key rules about locking in costs or interest rates. You only do it at a low point, never as a reaction to prices that have already surged. Following the 2005 price surge, natural gas was undercut by falling demand and rising supply from shale gas deposits in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The down side of locking in a natural gas price now is that you immediately increase your monthly gas bill. “The idea of locking is not to save in the first year – you can virtually never do that,” said Ian MacLellan, vice-president of marketing at Energyshop (energyshop.com) a source of information for consumers and business on energy prices. “Really, the idea of locking into a long-term gas contract is to save in the third, fourth and fifth years.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. MacLellan said that Enbridge and Union Gas, major gas suppliers in Ontario, have a current gas supply charge of 12 cents per cubic metre. That compares to a peak price around 42 cents and a long period around 35 cents that ended when the financial crisis hit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Energyshop website, the cheapest price that someone in Ottawa, where I live, can lock into for the next five years is 19.7 cents, a premium of about 64 per cent. However, the gas supply charge accounts for only about half of a heating bill. Mr. MacLellan said the other half is represented by storage and distribution costs, which tend to rise annually by the rate of inflation. Bottom line, an Ottawa resident's gas bill would go up by about one-third immediately in order to limit annual increases over the next five years to well below the inflation rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No question, it's possible for gas prices to move lower from the current level around $2.32 (U.S.) per million British thermal units. Looking at natural gas as an investment, one blogger recently called it “the widow maker” because of the potential for losses this year. If you're of a mind to lock in, don't hold off until gas prices start to rise. “If you wait to lock in until then, the long-term prices will already have gone up,” Mr. MacLellan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compare lock-in rates for natural gas on the Energyshop website or by Googling “natural gas contracts.” Prices vary by a surprising degree, which raises the question of whether there's any risk in going with the lowest-cost firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's no risk in signing up with the lowest cost provider, even if you haven't heard of them,” Mr. MacLellan said. He argues that if your supplier goes bankrupt, its contracts would be bought by a competitor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. MacLellan speculated that people may end up paying higher prices to lock in because they get caught up in sales pitches made by door-to-door salespeople. Before committing to any such contract, always shop the market to get comparative prices.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a premier trying to establish her conservative credentials, Christy Clark has had a nice run of late.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In no particular order, the B.C. Liberal Premier appointed a top federal Tory strategist as her new chief of staff, received national press attention for her perceived efforts to import Stephen Harper's brand of conservatism to the West Coast and the topper – her <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> moment with the Prime Minister in a local ice rink while watching her son play hockey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A slice of Canadiana captured for posterity – and the next provincial election – by a shutterbug on the Premier's staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that regard, the Premier's efforts to cast her Liberal administration in a bluer hue has had all the subtlety of football's end-zone dance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest immediate threat to her party's re-election chances is not the New Democratic Party, which leads the polls, but the upstart B.C. Conservative Party, which appears to be badly draining support from the right flank of the party's Liberal-Conservative coalition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent poll had the Liberals and Conservatives tied at 23 per cent. (The NDP were at 40.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The man who has singlehandedly changed the Liberal Party's game plan quietly snickers when asked to discuss Ms. Clark's efforts to reframe herself through a conservative lens. But as he speaks, former Conservative MP and now B.C. Conservative Party Leader John Cummins seems less amused by the degree to which the Premier appears to be trying to change stripes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It won't work,” says Mr. Cummins. “People aren't stupid. They see what she's trying to do. It's all smoke and mirrors.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He insists the Premier won't be able to bamboozle conservative-minded voters with superficial photo-ops and impulsive decisions to import Tory strategists into her office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On that front, Mr. Cummins speaks of Ken Boessenkool, a former adviser and strategist to Mr. Harper who earlier this month was named the Premier's new chief of staff. In recent years, Mr. Boessenkool made a name for himself in Ottawa as a lobbyist for clients such as <span class="companylink">Taser International</span> and Enbridge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, that Enbridge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Boessenkool joins old friend Dimitri Pantazopoulos, a Tory who also worked for Mr. Harper at one time, who was brought in earlier by Ms. Clark for his campaign skills and is now working in interprovincial relations in the Premier's office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, none of this impresses a long-time conservative like Mr. Cummins, whose right-wing bona fides are fairly impeccable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Mr. Boessenkool is not a B.C. guy,” says Mr. Cummins. “He doesn't know anything about this province. He's an Alberta guy who worked for Stockwell Day … when the Conservatives became government he moved to Calgary, which became his base of operations as a lobbyist. He doesn't have much of a connection to B.C. and his strength is communications, not policy, not government organization.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cummins also feels that Mr. Boessenkool's past connection with Enbridge poses a potential dilemma for a government that has tried to stay neutral on the future of the controversial Northern Gateway pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Now you have to ask are the decisions the government makes on the pipeline going to be made in the best interests of British Columbians or the best interests of Enbridge?” says the Tory leader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, that is politicking at its best. Or worst, depending on your view of such things. Mr. Cummins supports the pipeline, so how could he then question the government if it eventually decides to support it as well? One thing Ms. Clark has been fairly transparent about is her party's strategy: scare the living daylights out of those voters now flirting with the B.C. Conservatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the Liberals intend on doing this by reminding voters how awful it was under the NDP in the 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cummins scoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If that's the best they have after more than a decade in power that's pretty pathetic and shows you just how desperate they are,” he says. “They should have a positive record to run on instead of resorting to scare tactics. But that seems to be their only strategy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is betting British Columbians are no longer interested in that stale old argument.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last September, the Senators had a new head coach, a half-dozen grads from their AHL championship team in Binghamton, N.Y., moving in, Daniel Alfredsson coming back off surgery and two veteran Europeans, Sergei Gonchar and Filip Kuba, in desperate need of a bounce-back season. And when they started losing, they didn't just lose a couple of heartbreakers. They were getting wiped out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So while the Edmonton Oilers were briefly the darlings of the NHL, coming off an 8-4 start, it looked as if the Senators were about to endure the early stages of a rebuilding year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surprise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Sens playing a game here Monday, and then another in Phoenix on Tuesday, before returning home to play host to the all-star game, the roles are significantly reversed. Edmonton is long gone from the playoff race and Ottawa is keeping up with the big boys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anderson, who arrived in Ottawa in a deal with the Colorado Avalanche for goalie Brian Elliott last February, acknowledges the massive changes resulted in some challenging early growing pains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When we were losing, we weren't losing 3-2, we were losing 6-2 or 7-2,” the 30-year-old American said. “It was just games that were getting out of control. But we learned from them, though. Since then, we've really established our game and found ways, when things weren't going our way, to keep the game interesting and keep it close.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anderson is having one of those seasons that is difficult to appreciate if it is filtered strictly through a statistical lens. The Senators have surrendered 1,609 shots this season, most in the NHL, leaving Anderson No. 33 in the NHL goalie ratings, which are based on goals-against average. However, he has a thoroughly respectable .912 save percentage and is tied for No. 2 in the league in the only stat his teammates care about – wins – with 25.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The first few weeks, we didn't play very well and that made his numbers look way worse than they should have been,” centre Jason Spezza said. “We gave a couple of teams seven goals and he was probably a victim of that more than anything.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sens got a glimpse of what Anderson could do in 18 appearances toward the end of last season, when Ottawa finished 13th overall, just two points out of the East basement. Anderson went 11-5-1, with a 2.05 GAA, a surge that took them out of the Ryan Nugent-Hopkins draft sweepstakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa liked enough of what they saw from Anderson to sign him to a multiyear contract extension. All those years of playing for the Florida Panthers earlier in his career when they were a mediocre team helped Anderson adjust to high shot totals. On a lot of nights, he plays his best hockey when the team is under siege.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A perfect example came last Thursday, against the San Jose Sharks, when the Sens fell behind 1-0, but survived the storm, thanks largely to Anderson's strong play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They're all over us in the first 10 minutes and it's 1-0 instead of 3-0,” Spezza said. “Then, we take control after that and win 4-1. So he's been a real calming presence for us that way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He's made big saves at the right time. He plays the puck well. He's been a workhorse. He's played every night, practises every day. He's showing he can be an everyday guy. He works hard in games and whenever we seem to have a lapse in the game, and we're maybe not as good as we should be, he kind of gets us through that and is giving us an opportunity to get wins.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senators will have 30 games remaining after the all-star break to secure that playoff spot. Heading into Monday, they already had 27 wins, five shy of their total last season. Even with games in hand, the Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens will have a hard time making up that ground in the Northeast Division.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We've been playing with good structure,” Spezza said. “We have a good, hard-working club, and we've had contributions from everyone. I think that's why our game is giving us results at home and on the road.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TTC chair Karen Stintz took a risky but important step when she questioned plans for the Eglinton-Scarborough Crosstown transit line. Risky because it puts her at odds with the man to whom she owes her post, Mayor Rob Ford. Important because it opens a debate on the biggest transit project in the city.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $8.2-billion light-rail line is to carry passengers from Black Creek Drive in the west to the Scarborough City Centre in the east, linking up with existing subway lines and easing congestion. The original plan for the line would have seen it travel through a tunnel in the centre of the city on either side of Yonge Street, but above ground on less dense areas such as the eastern stretch of Eglinton Avenue. When he took office in 2010, Mr. Ford ripped up that plan, along with the rest of Transit City, and said that the whole line must go underground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, Ms. Stintz says, makes no sense. Light-rail vehicles are designed to travel on the surface, and the broad streets of east Eglinton have plenty of room for them. If it is going to be light rail, she wants to go back to Plan A and make it a mixed line: part underground, part above.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be much cheaper that way – $1-billion to $1.5-billion cheaper, she says – and the money saved could be used to pay for an extension to the Sheppard subway, Mr. Ford's favoured project. Changing back to the original plan could save time, too, because the environmental assessments for Plan A have already been completed and, with less tunnelling required, construction would be quicker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are two barriers to Ms. Stintz's excellent idea: the province and the mayor. Take the province first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less than a year ago, Mr. Ford and Premier Dalton McGuinty struck a deal to have the province build an all-buried Eglinton line and the city build a Sheppard subway. Given all the back-and-forth we've seen over transit in recent decades – an Eglinton line was started then stopped in the 1990s – provincial officials would be reluctant to change course yet again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the political winds have changed since Mr. McGuinty, facing a tough fight for re-election and trying to avoid a fight with a popular and newly elected Mr. Ford, signed that memorandum of understanding. The wording of the memorandum makes clear that it is a non-binding letter of intent, not a binding contract. If city council voted to return to Plan A for Eglinton and request the leftover money be used for Sheppard, Queen's Park would at least have to consider it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Support is growing on city council for just such a vote. It comes not only from left-leaning councillors who hope, against the odds, to revive Transit City, but from moderate and even conservative councillors who wonder how much sense it makes to spend hundreds of millions of dollars tunnelling under the wide open spaces of Eglinton east with a light-rail line, not to mention the expense of spanning the vast Don Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conservative-minded Councillor John Parker has raised doubts about burying the whole Eglinton line and using LRT technology designed mainly for surface travel. Centrist Josh Matlow says he is “on the same page” as Ms. Stintz about the Eglinton line and urges the mayor to consider her idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will he? Changing his mind on Eglinton will not be easy. His dislike of streetcars is well known, and the way he sees it, the light-rail lines that would go on Eglinton east are just a fancy kind of streetcar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gordon Chong, a Ford associate who is looking into ways of financing a Sheppard subway line, sounds lukewarm on Ms. Stintz's proposal. “While her suggestion is one way to free up funds,” he told me in an e-mail, “it's not my preferred choice.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the mayor would bend a bit on his stubborn opposition to rails on streets, he has much to gain. His Sheppard project is in trouble. Mr. Chong, who will present his report soon, has made it clear that even if the city can woo private-sector investors to the project, it will require government money, too. If more is left over from Eglinton by running it above ground where possible, the mayor could get a bigger down payment on Sheppard.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 2007, Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie were gods. Everyone agreed the <span class="companylink">Research in Motion</span> CEOs were the two smartest guys in Canada, possibly the world. Anyone who was a someone had a BlackBerry. It meant you were a player. Even Barack Obama had one! Even if you didn't, you cheered for RIM because finally we could forget the national embarrassment of Nortel and hold our heads up in the world. Thanks to them, our whole country was a player!</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Roman emperors paraded through the streets in triumph, they used to hire a slave to whisper in their ear, “Remember, you are just a man.” Maybe Mike and Jim should've tried that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone in 2007, Mr. Lazaridis trashed it. He told employees nobody wanted a personal computer on their phone. Then, RIM commanded nearly half the U.S. smartphone market. Today, it has more like 10 per cent. Not only do we like computers on phones, we like wasting millions of hours playing Angry Birds. Who knew?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worse things got, the more arrogant they got. Last spring, Mr. Lazaridis walked out of a BBC interview because he didn't like the question. “You implied that we have a security problem; we don't have a security problem,” he said. “We've just been singled out because we're so successful around the world. It's an iconic product, used by business – it's used by leaders, it's used by celebrities, it's used by consumers, it's used by teenagers – we were just singled out.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there was the money. Funny things happen to people who get stupendously rich. Instead of dreaming night and day about the next great product, they start to dream about building the most spectacular mansion, or buying a National Hockey League team. Mr. Lazaridis's construction project (a 24,000-square-foot “cottage” on the shores of Lake Huron) has been going on for years. Mr. Balsillie spent three years haggling for the Pittsburgh Penguins, the <span class="companylink">Nashville Predators</span> and the Phoenix Coyotes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Mr. Jobs was dreaming up products people would line up overnight to buy. As money manager Tom Caldwell said, “Once the CEO is building the maxi-yacht or the great mansion or trying to buy hockey teams, he is not paying attention to his business, in my mind.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jobs despised tech billionaires who acquired mansions and fancy toys. “I'm not going to let money ruin my life,” he told his biographer. He had no taste for “that nutso lavish lifestyle that so many people do when they get rich.” The trouble is that people who get rich get fat and soft. They're not hungry any more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jobs knew that if you stop swimming fast enough, you die. He was a screaming perfectionist who cursed out his staff when they moved too slowly, or when some product detail wasn't good enough. Meanwhile, last year, when RIM released the PlayBook, which was supposed to compete with Apple's iPad, it was a miserable flop: It couldn't do e-mail. It had no Skype, no GPS, no Angry Birds. As a New York Times tech reviewer wrote incredulously, “There's no app for that.” It wouldn't even fit into the breast pocket of a jacket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, we basked in RIM's reflected glory. We celebrated the founders as geniuses and nation builders because they proved that Canada could lead the world in the world's hottest field. But the RIM guys clung to power far too long. Guys like that always do.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's start by getting this out of the way: There is much about foreign aid that works.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We should put to rest the tired arguments about whether countries like Canada should give any aid at all. Those who say it is a black hole of spending neglect the fact that for millions of people, aid has literally saved their lives. In doing so, it has created more favourable conditions for global prosperity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is far from a conclusive answer to poverty, but aid can transform lives by creating the basic conditions required for a people to prosper: good health, access to education and responsible governance. From this fertile soil much can grow, and does.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take Malawi, one of the least developed countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Life in this small, landlocked country has become appreciably better in recent years due to foreign aid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the introduction of an aid-funded fertilizer subsidy program, cereal production has nearly doubled. With the country now able to feed itself year in and year out, life expectancy has jumped from 46 to 54, despite the ravages of AIDS. And GDP has grown by more than 9 per cent a year, making Malawians on average twice as rich as they were a decade ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is an impressive record. Even more impressive is that it's been replicated throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now comes the regretful part of this story: While foreign aid is doing much good, it could work a lot better than it does now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The aid system has been built on a shaky foundation, modelled on the framework of a construction project: Project plans are drawn up, financing is provided, procurement of services and goods follows, ending with project execution and a finished product. In an example from the aid sector, the flawed logic follows that if a water pump is planned and installed, a community will have clean water. Voila.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that we, the benevolent donors, delude ourselves by believing that development is so linear. We desperately want aid to be simple, even if it means avoiding the mounting wall of evidence that proves it is not. The shiny, build-a-water-pump style of aid might make for a great photo op – happy children playing in the fresh water, a group of women being trained to make up a water committee. But over time, pumps break down, and water committees don't have the resources to fix them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's an inconvenient truth that we need to take a more systemic approach, getting serious about investing in cash-strapped local institutions that will ultimately be responsible for the long-term development of their countries. Right now, that's not happening. In Malawi, for instance, donors spend about 10 times more money on short-term water and sanitation projects than on the institutions that will manage them in the long-term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the bright side, new models and efforts are emerging that recognize the need for a smarter approach to foreign aid. One practical solution is called “Cash on Delivery” aid, aiming to realign the unequal power relationship that prevails between donor and recipient countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash on Delivery puts accountability at the heart of the aid relationship. The basic idea is that donor countries transfer aid money when there are measurable, proven results. Take education financing: A primary indicator is established up front – for example, school examination pass rates – with funds transferred to the recipient country only after progress is achieved. This puts responsibility for achieving results firmly in the hands of recipient countries, providing the flexibility and incentives needed to achieve a goal in the way that makes the most sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada and other donor countries would be wise to stop viewing aid as a “construction project” and recognize that systemic approaches to development are necessary to get the results we want.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aid works. But it could work much better. Let's get on with it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The imitators took the premise and format of the video, and used them as a template. Soon, there appeared a … Guys Say. Then … Dads Say. And … Jewish Girls Say. And … Black Guys Say. Suburban Moms, Gay Guys, Asian Chicks, Jamaican Parents, New Yorkers, Project Managers – and on and on, one for every self-identified group that counts among its numbers an aspiring comedian with a video camera. Some are great; some distinctly less so. (It should be a given that in any viral meme, whatever its nature, some of its participants are clunkers.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, they started talking to each other: … White Girls Say To Black Girls (view count: seven million-plus and counting) sparked a flurry of commentary from Twitter to <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, to MTV to BET. Performed by Franchesca Ramsey, a black comedian and video blogger (wearing a blond wig in this instance), it adopted the format and acute observation of Mr. Sheppard's original, but replaced the gentility with something a little more pointed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Is it, like, bad to do blackface? Is that still, like, a thing?” parrots Ms. Ramsey, in the video, leaning around the edge of a roommate's door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You can say the N-word, but I can't? How is that okay?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This opened up another round.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ramsey's video was soon accompanied by the worthwhile … Girls Say to Gay Guys (“So, like, you've never been with a girl?”); … Guys Say to Gay Guys; … White Girls Say to Arabs; … Straight Girls Say to Lesbians. More are no doubt worthwhile, though we're approaching the realm of meta-parodies already.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What started as a piece of comedy became a staging point for a discussion of gender, then a discussion of sex and gender, then a discussion of sex and race and gender, then a discussion of sex and race and gender and how irritating project managers are. Before long, it became an all-purpose tool for dissecting the way group A talks to group B; a Festivus-style airing-of-the-grievances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The uncanny thing is that, for all that, the spirit of Mr. Sheppard's original piece hasn't been lost in the fray. The tenor of these pieces remains pointed observation, not anger. What has changed is that, as the meme became politicized, the focus of that observation has shifted away from mannerisms, and onto what some observers have pegged as “microaggressions” – the things that people who come from a position of privilege say when confronted with people who aren't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These tiny aggressions have a way of reinforcing the status quo, but they don't have to be statements of malice; like so many of the statements in the later videos, they manifest a kind of friendly cluelessness. These videos cuttingly send up the ways that people have been trained to espouse political correctness without the slightest grasp on why.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another hallmark of Mr. Sheppard's original has persisted, perhaps the one that raised the most hackles in the first place: the fact that he was in drag. In many of these videos, actors play across lines of gender, sex and race: guys playing girls; gay guys playing straight guys; black girls playing white girls; and so on. And by their format, many of these observations seem to be made about the producers' own friends. The result is a product that speaks of empathy rather than slagging. Uncomfortable, unsettling empathy, but empathy all the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discussion of race, gender and class in our culture is governed by unspoken rules about who is allowed to say what about whom. Those rules are there for a reason, but it can take a transgression or two to make people pay attention, by the million. Not bad for a one-minute comedy bit.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giving head coach Ron Wilson a contract extension was a necessity, Brian Burke said, because “when a coach goes into the cage, he needs both the whip and the chair, not just one.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What the Toronto Maple Leafs general manager needs to add now is the tiger – the same tiger he has failed to add since acquiring Phil Kessel in September of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forget the angst about a veteran goaltender or a shut-down defenceman or “secondary scoring.” As currently constituted, this group of Leafs forwards isn't good enough to be anything other than first-round road kill if they make the playoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's been 28 months since Kessel was acquired and he's still stuck with lightweight centres to go along with a winger – Joffrey Lupul – that Burke lucked into. That's a long time to wait for the other shoe to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Maple Leafs will play on Long Island on Tuesday, before shutting it down for the NHL all-star break, and Monday's 3-0 win over the New York Islanders pretty much summed up the stasis that has characterized what should have been an easy stretch of 10 games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday will signal the end of a run against competition that seemed mostly inferior when it all started on Jan. 3 against the Tampa Bay Lightning. Just one of those games was on the road (in Buffalo, which hardly counts) and the Leafs picked up 12 points in that time – simply not good enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that it has been all bad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The penalty kill has righted itself and is arguably more effective than it has been in Wilson's tenure. The Leafs have yet to allow a power-play goal in 2012 (16-for-16) so all that fuss during the team's first practice of the new year – remember that players-only meeting, followed by animated discussions between players and coaches on the ice, and finally ropes that were brought out to map out shooting lanes and blocking strategies? – appears to have paid off. Regular use of Darryl Boyce and Joey Crabb has given the penalty kill an edge it lacked earlier in the season, but mostly it is a new sense of discipline. Fewer penalties mean less energy expended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also has a trickle-down effect on the goaltending, as Wilson explained after goaltender Jonas Gustavsson's third shutout of the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The penalty kill is a tiring part for the goalie, because when a team's in your zone for two minutes, that's a lot of moving side to side,” the coach said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burke doesn't need anyone to remind him that he needs to make a significant acquisition; that it makes no sense to go all-in with a head coach who hasn't had a sniff of the playoffs since he's been in Toronto and then sit back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GM said this month he is interested in making a trade sooner than later. But he also suggested he won't move defenceman Luke Schenn (when rumours surfaced the Philadelphia Flyers might be interested) and that is in the very least unnerving. Schenn and forward Nazem Kadri should most definitely be in play – as should about 80 per cent of the roster and anybody with the AHL's Toronto Marlies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is understandable Maple Leafs fans would treat every draft choice and every prospect as a gift from the hockey gods – given the history of “draft schmaft,” John Ferguson Jr., and all that – but there is no way Burke should be putting limits on himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who knows if some of the sexier names on the rumour mill – Anaheim Ducks winger Bobby Ryan, etc. – are anything more than somebody's guesstimate or hunch?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a premium to be paid for being able to make a trade in advance of the league's Feb. 27 deadline and now is not the time to be shy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only the true believers can look at January with satisfaction. Burke doesn't have that luxury. He's paid to be smarter than any of us.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘I wanna show that gospel, country, blues, rhythm and blues, jazz, rock 'n' roll are all just really one thing. Those are the American music and that is the American culture,” said Etta James, who died of leukemia on Friday at the age of 73, and who did effuse together all of these music genres in her long, tumultuous career.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, in doing so, she never made American music homogeneous: she merely put her imprimatur on soul, jazz, the blues, rock and so on, making every song she sang absolutely her own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As tributes to the great artist continue to pour out, it is Roseanne Barr, of all people, who seems hell-bent on best remembering, even vindicating, Lady James.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barr went on Twitter on Friday and raved about James's mesmerizing 1995 memoir, Rage to Survive, then seethed that “I lost ALL respect for Obama when he dissed Etta James in favour of Beyoncé. No respect for women at all …”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barr is referring to one of the President's 10 inauguration balls in 2009: the gala musical performance, which featured Sheryl Crow, Herbie Hancock, Bono and Beyoncé, who was invited to sing At Last for his spot-lit slow dance with Michelle Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Last was Etta James's signature song, and she had been performing the 1941 Mack Gordon and Harry Warren song since 1960. Her rendition was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyoncé had just played Etta James in the film Cadillac Records, but the question remains: His obviously disquieting taste in music notwithstanding, why would Obama insult one of the greatest female artists in history by not inviting her to sing her own song, and by inviting her impersonator?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One feels that – with this guest list – if John Coltrane had been alive, Herbie Hancock would still have made the cut. Beyoncé does not sing the song nearly as well, and lacks the heart to sing it the way James did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blond-beehived, cat-eyed James struggled with addiction and obesity for a great deal of her adult life; she grew up with a single mother she called “the Mystery Lady,” and was a self-described wild child and juvenile delinquent. But she lived beautifully: The “rage” in her book title refers to her hatred of injustice and exploitation; it refers also to her burning desire to express her sweet, sharp, melancholy, roaring self.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And she was sharp-tongued, no shrinking violet. At a concert in Seattle in 2009, James told the crowd that she disliked the President and Beyoncé, adding that she “had no business up there singing … singing my song that I've been singing forever.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A perfectly reasonable, if not poignant, remark. Yet James received so much flak that her son to this day chalks up her comments as signs of the “drug-induced dementia” that shadowed her last days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's no damn business like show business,” Billie Holiday once said. “You have to smile to keep from throwing up.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bit about vomiting has to do with the way in which true genius – like Holiday's, like James's – is revered and slighted in that milieu. Admittedly, James's career has been increasingly feted with major awards since the 1990s, and so many singers, including Beyoncé, are expressing their great admiration and debt to her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if she is such a legend, why was she not pushed forward more in her life?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was nothing simple, or easily mainstreamed, about the way James sang. Pure soul is not easy to listen to; it is an emotional assault. And she did come up at a time when black artists had a hard time and/or resisted crossing over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there was her constant pain, a terrible byproduct of drawing – as her admirer Amy Winehouse did – so deeply from the heart. Ultimately, great talent is not for everyone. It asks too much of our own emotions, aesthetics and artistic intelligence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I saw her perform in the 1990s before a respectably large audience, but by no means huge; a friend saw her play at the tiny Brunswick House (a Toronto college bar) around the same time. She was rarely asked to appear at major events or to do major interviews. James was not hot news by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She did appear on TV to sing At Last in 2009, on Dancing with the Stars – a sad, tacky show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, she sang it with everything she had. As she observed of Holiday, “She couldn't lie. … The woman just didn't know how to fake her feelings.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James, at the very least, would have known that her work stands alone; that it leaves us with a record of her life, and of the lives of all striving, passionate and fearless women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From her raunchy, sexy songs (the then-scandalous and still-hot Roll with Me Henry and Good Rockin' Daddy) to her piercing ballads (Tell Mama, I've Been Lovin' You Too Long and I'd Rather Go Blind) to her always-unexpected takes on rock (2011's Welcome to the Jungle) and her stunning tribute to Lady Day (1993's movingly titled Mystery Lady), James created, over all, a discourse about a black woman in America, as she intended, in addition to a gorgeous mystery about love and pain, and how hard it is – how hard she raged – to find, to realize, a dream to call her own.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brother was on the doorstep when I arrived back from L.A.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Literally, on the doorstep. As the cab pulled up and I alighted, I saw a figure get up on his hind legs in the doorway. “How's your honour?” he roared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Ah, you are a judge?” the cab driver asked. “No,” I replied. “I am the condemned.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brother offered to carry my bags. I waved him away. I tried but failed to conceal the bottle of duty-free port upon my person. He eyed it. Meanwhile, I looked around suspiciously, searching for evidence of his posse of “lads” in the vicinity. Nothing. But I remained suspicious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indoors, the cats eyed the brother with alarm. Yes, him again. For some time now, the brother and a passel of his cronies, the lads, have been ensconced in Victoria, part of a rogue modern-dance troupe bent on dancing for dollars in the streets. As I was informed, “Victoria is where the youthful energy of the West Coast blends with the time-honoured British, European and Asian traditions.” And, as it transpired, the troupe was told to go away and quit bothering people. The brother was cited for being especially objectionable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What's going on?” I asked, sharply. The brother beamed. The cats backed away. “Canada's Got Talent!” he declared and waved his arms in a macabre manner, similar to how Krista Erickson waves her arms on Sun TV when she calls out to the “friends” she mistakenly believes are watching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My heart sank. I cursed the existence of every TV talent show. Riffraff in search of glory. The brother and the lads were setting their hearts on an appearance on Canada's Got Talent. The show, starting in March on CITY-TV, offers an opportunity to singers, dancers, magicians and “other performers of all ages,” who compete for a cash prize of $100,000 and a gig in Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As constant readers will remember, the brother once masqueraded as Joe Pieweed. He enter as a contestant on Canadian Idol as “Joe Pieweed, Performance Artist.” The judges had not been impressed by his rendition of Papa Ooh Mow Mow, especially as he had his T-shirt pulled over his head. Even Ben Mulroney had given him a quizzical look.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Canada's Got Talent, the plan is for a trio to compete. The brother plus Roy, who is one of the lads, and Roy's prospective spouse, one Gloria. It appears Gloria joined this motley crew because she was the only true fan of the rogue Modern Dance troupe dancing for dollars in the streets of Victoria. “Lovely, lovely young lady,” the brother said. “You haven't seen modern dance until you've witnessed her bony white elbows going up and down.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their routine, I was informed, will consist of the brother doing his infamous routine of pulling his shirt over his head and bellowing Papa Ooh Mow Mow, which will “segue” into Roy singing a medley of songs about Gloria. First, Van Morrison's Gloria – “Like to tell ya about my baby/You know she comes around/She about five feet four/A-from her head to the ground…”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This in turn will “segue naturally” to Roy's rendition of U2's Gloria – “I try to sing this song/ I try to stand up/ But I can't find my feet…” (“That sounds apt,” I interjected at this point.) And finally another “natural segue” into Laura Branigan's Gloria – “Leave them hangin' on the line, oh-oh-oh, calling Gloria, Gloria.” All the while, Gloria herself will be standing there, moving her bony white elbows up and down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will it impress the Canada's Got Talent judges – Martin Short, Measha Brueggergosman and Stephan Moccio? A gig in Vegas and a cash prize of $100,000?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Have you auditioned with this grotesquerie?” I asked. “Ah, no,” the brother replied. “Gloria encountered a bottle of schnapps the night before. Muggy heads ensued. But, we got it on video and sent it to Canada's Got Talent on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this point the doorbell rang. My heart sank further. It was like the scene in which there is the knocking at the gate in Macbeth (Act II, Scene 2). “That will be Roy,” the brother announced cheerily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As I moved warily to the door, the brother called out, “It behooves me to mention that there is a Plan B. In case Canada's Got Talent fails to grasp the singularity of our artistry.” He paused. “Plan is B is based on inside information that there will be a Canadian version of The Bachelor. I'll be there.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And me, I am truly the condemned.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dining out? Be prepared to see steeper bills at the end of the night. Making meals at home? You've probably already noticed a higher cost to do that as well. A multi-year increase in commodities markets means higher prices are starting to trickle down to our pocket books.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, peanut crops were smaller than normal last year, owing in part to a drought. With no apparent change in demand and a decrease in supply, prices shot up. That increase can already be felt at the grocery store, but as Kerry K. Taylor, author of the popular personal finance blog Squawkfox.com, notes, sometimes that price increase occurs through creative means. In one of her recent blog entries she recounts how her husband's favourite peanut butter used to cost $3.99 for 1 kilogram, but instead of the sticker price going up, the packaging and contents shrank to 750 grams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest Consumer Price Index report from Statistics Canada shows that increases aren't just happening in the peanut-butter sector. On the high end of the spectrum, the price of beef is up 8.1 per cent, eggs are up 14.2 per cent, flour is up 16.4 per cent and potatoes 18 per cent over the last year for purchases made at grocery stores..</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet despite all the increases, food purchased from table-service restaurants was up only 2.8 per cent over the same time. Up until now, most restaurateurs have been loath to raise prices on their menus – they'd rather tighten their profit margins to keep customers coming in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the U.S. restaurant market is any indicator, all the slack in the system might be gone. A recent survey of restaurant operators there indicated that 67 per cent would be increasing prices in 2012. It's hard to imagine that the increase in the prices of ingredients used to make our favourite meals will be absorbed by restaurateurs north of the border indefinitely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An RBC economics report indicated a 15.2-per-cent drop in agricultural commodity pricing during the final six months of 2011, but the longer trend has seen prices rising faster than inflation. If grocery-store items react more swiftly and restaurants are still playing catchup, brown-bagging might make more sense than ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts are also suggesting grocery-store prices will further benefit by increased competition as <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> makes a continued push into their grocery business lines. And when Target opens here in 2013, it is expected to make foray into grocery items as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So if you haven't been packing your lunches or preparing dinners at home, the financial incentive may soon be even greater than ever. I suppose, since there is a lag between when you've eaten enough and when you actually feel full, you could also try the peanut-butter portion-reduction trick on yourself. At least when you're the one doing it, you'll feel the commensurate reduction in cost, too.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He went to Quebec Superior Court for a delay, but Mr. Justice Michel Delorme told him to stop tribunal-shopping.” Even before Judge Delorme's rejection landed, Mr. Mugesera's lawyers had started a hearing, by telephone – in Federal Court again, citing the Canadian Constitution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1992, a time ripe for an explosion in Rwanda, Mr. Mugesera said in a speech, “Why do they not exterminate all of them? Are we really waiting till they come to exterminate us? Do not be afraid, know that anyone whose neck you do not cut is the one who will cut your neck.” In 1994, the genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus began. In Canada in 2005, Mr. Mugesera's lawyer, Guy Bertrand, argued that there was a Jewish conspiracy on the Supreme Court to deport him. Subsequently, that court was unanimous that he had called for murder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mugesera has lived in freedom in Quebec City for 17 years during deportation proceedings because Canada believes in due process and would not send him to a land where the jails are unsafe, the justice system is uncertain, and the death penalty may await. But Rwanda has grown up and has banished the death penalty, and at 5:14 p.m. on Monday, Mr. Mugesera, under guard, was airborne and bound for home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He did not deserve another day in Canada. Not even one. And Rwanda deserves him back for a fair trial.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RIM's recent troubles are partly attributable to an oversensitivity to criticism from the <span class="companylink">Apple</span> world – a milieu with a different sensibility. Its efforts to copy <span class="companylink">Apple</span>'s playfulness have sometimes been heavy-handed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Matthew Kelly of Level5 Strategic Brand Advisors says, RIM customers primarily “want to get stuff done”; they are glad to be getting Angry Birds, too, but that is secondary. The sense of fun should be accommodated, and a tablet should be among RIM's range of products. The priorities, however, are reliable and safe service, a convenient keyboard, and delivery of new products on schedule – in an age when people update their devices about every 18 months. The customers' trust in RIM's timing must be restored.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No doubt, the vacancy in the position of chief marketing officer should be filled, as Mr. Heins promises to do soon. But the essential message has to come from the CEO himself – especially after years of the unconventional two-headed leadership of Michael Lazaridis and James Balsillie – which worked well at first but was not viable in the longer term. Mr. Heins has said there will not be a “seismic shift” under his leadership, but a subtle, barely detectable repositioning will not suffice. The markets – customers and investors – want to hear a convincing narrative. In the end, of course, the performance of the products will be decisive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In spite of the fall in RIM's share price and its loss of market share in North America, RIM continues to be profitable and has a great deal of cash. It has one of the world's four major mobile operating systems. And it has global reach. In large developing economies, RIM is well ahead. North America may still have a more sophisticated electronic culture, but the BRIC countries and other similar economies will be the sources of most of the economic growth of the next few decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Research In Motion Ltd</span>. has many strengths. Its missteps must be taken seriously; a new forfeiture of trust could be fatal.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans liked Ike. Canadians liked Ike. Everybody liked Ike. He was a war hero, the supreme commander of the Allied Forces in the Second World War. He was one of the most successful Republican presidents, winning two terms and leaving office with ratings high.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dwight Eisenhower faded from public memory. When election seasons rolled around, Republicans didn't talk about him much. He wasn't held up, as he should have been, as a model military man and political leader. In today's Republican primaries, where candidates appear so amateurish by comparison, he gets the odd mention from Newt Gingrich. But it's always Ronald Reagan's name held on high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are reasons for the dimming of Ike's legacy. He was too pragmatic for raw Republicanism and too honest, especially on the subject of the armaments industry. At the close of his presidency, he uttered three loaded words. Having said those words, he could never be regarded by his party in a heroic way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eisenhower didn't become a Republican until 1952, the year he campaigned for the presidency. He had never been schooled on political partisanship. “My only appeal to you,” he said during the campaign, “my only appeal to America … is to place loyalty to the country above loyalty to a political party.” He forbade his staff to issue personal attacks against opponents. He was dismayed by the primal political instincts of his vice-president, Richard Nixon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As described in a new book by Jim Newton, Eisenhower: The White House Years, Ike's philosophy of governance was to find “the middle way.” It was a phrase he used often. He fought against excessive military spending and big, imprudent tax cuts. He rejected reports that exaggerated Soviet military strength from alarmists such as Paul Nitze. He turned back Pentagon pressure to go to war in Vietnam and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ike was repelled by McCarthyism, although he didn't move against it as strongly as he should have. (Fortunately, there were others who did so – and with a touch of humour. When Lucille Ball of I Love Lucy fame was accused of being in the Commie camp, her husband, Desi Arnaz, was quick to respond. “Lucy is my favourite redhead,” he said. “In fact, that's the only thing red about her – and even that's not legitimate.”)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Eisenhower visited Canada, thousands lined the streets to see him. He didn't know much about this country. Rather than worry about bilateral affairs, he preferred to spend his time on the golf course. (And who could blame him for that?) I've told the story of external minister Lester Pearson visiting him at the White House. Amazed that Ike hadn't even heard of a pressing Canadian issue, he muttered to an aide on the way out, “You'd think his caddie would have mentioned it to him.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ike had his drawbacks. He was too slow to move on civil rights. In foreign affairs, as Mr. Newton notes, he was too enamoured of covert action of the type that overthrew, in 1952, a democratically elected regime in Iran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But over all, his middle way was well favoured. Some still wonder whether Nixon would have won the 1960 election were it not for Ike's excessive candour. Asked to name an important decision his veep had participated in, Ike indelicately responded, “If you give me a week, I might think of one.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his farewell speech, Eisenhower talked ominously about the emergence of a permanent arms industry, corporations whose livelihoods depended on war and threats of war. He then spoke the three words he would be most remembered for, a phrase that peaceniks would come to invoke: “military-industrial complex.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were prophetic words, the invasion of Iraq being the most recent example of threat inflation. Today, we witness Mitt Romney, the so-called moderate Republican candidate, claiming that America, despite defence outlays of $500-billion a year in excess of its closest rival, cannot afford cuts in defence spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That kind of rubbish is cheered on lustily by today's Republicans. It's no wonder that Ike isn't a hero to them. He made too much sense.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reprising a tactic used by iconic Democratic presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, President Barack Obama is proposing wide-ranging measures aimed at ensuring a “fair shot” for all Americans by attacking the roots of U.S. income inequality.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his final State of the Union address before he faces voters this fall, a newly combative Mr. Obama called Tuesday for a major overhaul of the U.S. tax code to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay at least 30 per cent of their income in taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Washington should stop subsidizing millionaires,” Mr. Obama said. “You can call this class warfare all you want. But asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes? Most Americans would call that common sense.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The speech – which included proposals to revitalize U.S. manufacturing, help distressed homeowners and invest more in green energy, infrastructure and job training – laid out the themes of Mr. Obama's re-election pitch against a Republican opposition hostile to government intervention, income redistribution and tax increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of Americans barely get by,” the President said, “or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's speech came just hours after his possible GOP rival in November, Mitt Romney, released tax filings showing the onetime corporate buyout mogul and his wife paid an overall tax rate of less than 15 per cent on income of $42.5-million in 2010 and 2011. Mr. Obama and his wife paid a rate of 26 per cent on 2010 income of $1.7-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I get a tax break I don't need and the country can't afford, it either adds to the deficit or somebody else has to make up the difference – like a senior on a fixed income, or a student trying to get through school, or a family trying to make ends meet,” the President said. “That's not right.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cornerstone of Mr. Obama's “fair shot” proposals – which recall Mr. Roosevelt's New Deal and the Fair Deal of Mr. Truman – is the so-called Buffet Rule that would set a minimum 30-per-cent tax rate for millionaires. The idea was inspired by billionaire Warren Buffett, who lamented that he paid a lower effective tax rate than his secretary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Obama first floated the Buffett Rule several months ago, he used Tuesday's speech before a television audience of as many as 50 million Americans to provide the specifics of his proposal, which faces an icy reception from Republicans in Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, lower tax rates on capital gains, dividends and interest payments – which account for a large share of income earned by the wealthy – mean the richest Americans often pay proportionally less in taxes than their middle-class counterparts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, a worker earning between $35,000 and $85,000 in salary pays a marginal tax rate of 25 per cent, in addition to a Social Security payroll tax of 4.2 per cent. The rate on capital gains, the primary source of Mr. Romney's income, is only 15 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's tax proposals stand in stark contrast to those of GOP front-runners Newt Gingrich and Mr. Romney, setting the scene for an epochal election battle fought over the size and role of government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gingrich would eliminate all taxes on capital gains, effectively reducing the tax rate on many of the wealthiest Americans, including Mr. Romney, to zero. Mr. Romney would eliminate capital-gains taxes for American households making less than $200,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama described his proposals as “a blueprint for an economy that's built to last.” But in a “prebuttal” to the speech, Mr. Romney delivered a critique of the President's policies that accused him of “building a European-style welfare state.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Mr. Romney reiterated his plan to “cut, cap and balance” the federal budget, permanently extend Bush-era tax rates for the wealthy that are set to expire at the end of 2012, and accelerate the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta to Texas.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">NHL</span> all-star game is a funny animal – more of a trade show than an actual sporting competition. A chance for the league to exhale past the halfway point of the season before moving into the stretch drive, where the games suddenly take on a real meaning.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been this way since roughly the mid-1990s. Some old-timers can remember when players gave no quarter in the all-star game, wanted to attend, wanted to win and (gasp) sometimes, even threw the odd bodycheck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2012 edition in Ottawa will not be so, thus it's hard to muster any sort of outrage for the steady stream of players begging off, preferring to spend the break as just that – a week to get away from the grind of the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is particularly easy to sympathize with the league's older guard such as Nicklas Lidstrom, Teemu Selanne and Daniel Alfredsson, who is participating as the weekend's unofficial host after being voted into the starting lineup by Ottawa fans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lidstrom is 41. Three years ago, he withdrew from the all-star game in Montreal, citing a recurring issue of tendinitis that he wanted to rest over the break.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NHL commissioner Gary Bettman played hardball with Lidstrom and teammate Pavel Datsyuk that year. His point was: If you were too injured to play in an all-star game, then you better be too injured to play in the first game after the break, too. So the Red Wings went into a game against the Columbus Blue Jackets without Lidstrom and Datsyuk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a backlash towards Bettman's ruling and he hasn't again invoked the policy, adopted by the board of governors in 2008. This year, when the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s hockey operations department was casting about for the 36 players to fill out the all-star teams, they quietly approached both Lidstrom and to Selanne, 41, beforehand and asked about their intentions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both politely said: Thanks, but no thanks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Selanne happened to be passing through Calgary the day the announcements were made and his body language and twinkling smile were telling, in explaining how the whole thing went down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Selanne asked the league to send his teammate Corey Perry instead, on the grounds Perry was the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s reigning most valuable player. Left unsaid was the fact Selanne talked it over with Perry beforehand, because he didn't want to burden a teammate with an obligation unless he genuinely wanted to go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Lidstrom acted as one of the league captains, presiding good-naturedly over the first “fantasy” draft, where the players were chosen schoolyard style – and he fully bought into the process. It was the 11th all-star appearance of his career (which, to my way of thinking, gives him the right to bow out this time around).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alfredsson is an Ottawa institution, and he was going to stay in town for all-star weekend anyway, even if he wasn't selected to play in the game. However, he acknowledged had the geography been reversed, he might have thought twice about playing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Say if the all-star game was in Anaheim, and I would have to leave my family because they couldn't get away, it would be tough, no question,” Alfredsson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Injury absences – or the simple wear-and-tear of a long season on an older player – are a lot different to explain (and easier to forgive) than Washington Capitals winger Alex Ovechkin withdrawing in a snit over the fact he was suspended three games by the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> player safety department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At some point, the 26-year-old, who already has four all-star appearances under his belt, will find himself in the same category as Lidstrom, Selanne and others – able to gracefully say no thanks to the all-star opportunity and handing the obligation over to the league's younger (and generally more eager) players.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the aftermath of his suspension for a head shot, it just comes across as more spoiled-brat behaviour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's an easy fix to the problem: Whenever a player reaches the age of 30, he should have the right to opt out of an all-star game if he shows up the year before. It would be a workable compromise, permitting players to meet their obligations to market the league but spreading the burden to do so over a larger playing population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And frankly, the way the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> is today, with a revolving cast of recognizable stars, but not one that is the real discernible face of the league, it would keep everybody happy.</p>
