<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, it seems like there are two Mark Wahlbergs. Last Sunday at the Golden Globe awards, he was Wahlberg the mini-mogul. Resplendent in an old-school tuxedo, with Diddy as his date (the two are developing some projects together, Wahlberg told MTV), he held court at one of HBO's tables, and though the show he produces, Boardwalk Empire, didn't win anything this year, his wattage as one of Hollywood's hottest hyphenates was undiminished. On any given day, Wahlberg, 41, is starring in and/or promoting movies that he may or may not have produced, as well as producing and/or promoting TV series that he may or may not appear in. His most recent film, the crime thriller Broken City, opened yesterday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early December, when Wahlberg blew through Toronto, he wore his other persona, the tough from hardscrabble South Boston. He slouched on a hotel sofa dressed in work boots, a jacket that read “Crew” and jeans with rips in both thighs; he kept fingering the rips as he talked. His customary couple of guys, including his brother James, were along (the HBO series he inspired and produced, Entourage, wasn't all fiction). Later, his old pal Tie Domi, the former Maple Leafs enforcer, joined them, reeking of cologne, and they put on a little show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wahlberg, who learned to box for 2010's The Fighter, joshingly challenged Domi to a fight at the Air Canada Centre (“In boxing, you can't hold somebody's shirt and punch him in the head,” he dissed). Domi countered with, “I've watched Mark shoot fight scenes. No one's hitting his pretty face. I fought the most fights in NHL history, 333. Guys a lot bigger than me, who were trying to kill me. I didn't have anyone there to say, ‘Cut.'” Then the two pretended to square off while two comely female reporters took cellphone photos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So which is the real Wahlberg? The one in the tux, of course – but he keeps the Southie alive in him, because that's what got him here. The youngest of nine siblings, Wahlberg grew up in a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment with his working-class parents and a grandmother. Four of his siblings did time, as did he: four months in prison for a racially motivated assault on a Vietnamese man that left his victim blind in one eye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That experience scared him so straight that he hasn't stopped working since, first as the rapper Marky Mark, then as an Oscar-nominated actor (The Departed). It's why he's such a dedicated a family man (he's been with his wife, the model Rhea Durham, since 2001); why he's so determined that his two daughters and two sons, aged 9 to 3, learn to appreciate what they have and give back. It's why he formed The Mark Wahlberg Youth Foundation, which is dedicated to improving the quality of life for inner-city youth; and why he spent the day after our interview working the phones for a joint fundraiser with CIBC. It's why he got his largest tattoo, an inked rosary around his neck, and it's why he still gets on his knees every day to thank God for what he's got.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I always feel like there's a good chance I'm going to end up back there,” Wahlberg says. Even his voice has a dual nature: It's raspy with a cold and clotted with Southie vowels, but also soft and lilting. (Andy Samberg's Wahlberg impression on Saturday Night Live, with its catchphrase, “Say hi to your muttha for me,” nailed his mix of tough and sweet.) “It keeps me focused and working hard and trying to do the right thing. I don't want to let my guard down and feel too comfortable. If you become complacent, you start feeling entitled. I'm ready to go dig ditches if I have to. Whatever I gotta do to provide for my family. Whatever I gotta do to make sure that I do the best possible job at whatever wonderful opportunities I've been handed.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His production company, Closest to the Hole, rose from his need to be self-sustaining: “Producing gives you a lot of control, and that's always been the issue for me,” he says. “I would rather be the one driving the car. If we crash, at least I can blame myself.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inherently frugal, he's figured out how to do more with less. For example, his upcoming action comedy 2 Guns, opposite Denzel Washington, was originally budgeted at $150-million (U.S.). Wahlberg hired the rising Icelandic director Baltazar Kormakur, who knows how to make small budgets look big, and shot it in New Mexico in 50 days, for half the price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Before us, The Lone Ranger was there,” Wahlberg says, grinning. “It's about two guys on horses, and it cost $280-million to make. What the fuck were these horses doing? Do they fly? It's crazy!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And no matter how hard he works, Wahlberg never complains. “We just did a movie that was really difficult to make, Lone Survivor,” he says. “It's about the worst tragedy in the history of the Navy SEALS; it's the fourth movie that I've done in a row; and it was close to being one of the most difficult that I've made throughout my entire career.” The rigorous shoot was demanding both physically and emotionally – “what really happened to this man who was standing on-set with us, the trauma that would never go away for him; and what happened to the guys and their families, and to the people of Afghanistan,” he continues. “I wanted to complain. I really did. But I wouldn't. I might go home after a hard day and shed a tear or two. But I won't complain.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor will he slow down. Despite making four movies back-to-back, producing television, working with his charity and raising his young children, Wahlberg still calls his agent and his manager/producing partner “10 times a day, asking, ‘What are we doing?'” Although he just wrapped one film, and has his next lined up – the fourth Transformers, with director Michael Bay, which he'll shoot this spring – “I feel like I'm unemployed right now,” he says. “I may try to squeeze something in beforehand. I just have that mentality, strike while the iron's hot, because it could all be gone tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Broken City, which he also produced, Wahlberg plays a dirty-seeming cop who investigates a clean-seeming mayor (Russell Crowe). He understood his character's journey, because he lived it. “I had to do some redeeming myself,” he sums up. “The bad guy who's trying to do something good is usually the one I root for.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The timing could not be worse; the country could hardly be less known; the internal complexities more intractable; the terrain more vast and forbidding; in short, intervention by Western countries in Mali would be fraught with problems.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hand the average Canadian (or American) a map of the world and say, “point to Mali.” The results would quite likely not be pretty. Far away geographically, Mali is just as far away intellectually from people in this part of the world. What national interest, Canadians might inquire, must be defended in that place?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be nice to say: Let Africans solve African problems. But, of course, the military forces being slowly and unsteadily assembled among various African states to fight the jihadis in Mali (and perhaps elsewhere) are completely unequal to the task. They lack security intelligence, air capacity, transport, military skills and perhaps even the political will required to take on jihadis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jihadi groups in Mali are part of a wider network that stretches across a band of instability almost from the Atlantic to the Red Sea across north-central Africa. If their ambit expands farther – it has already spread into northern Nigeria, Africa's most populous country – the world will have to contend with yet another nexus of unstable states and spawning grounds for terror.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western countries are damned if they do, and possibly damned if they don't intervene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">France, the former colonial power in Mali, has taken the lead militarily and has looked around for tangible help, only to find very little on offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada has sent one plane – for a week! – reflecting Prime Minister Stephen Harper's judgment that the Canadian public is hostile to any military intervention. He quite likely, and reasonably, must wonder: If Canada gets in for a penny, can it get out for one, or will inexorably the country be in for a pound? Never enter a military conflict without clear goals, sufficient resources and an eventual exit strategy – none of which are yet clearly apparent in Mali.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mali and Afghanistan are different in many ways, but in the minds of the electorate they are as one: distant sinkholes for money and personnel, easier to enter than to exit. The prospect of intervening in Mali when Afghanistan fatigue has descended on Western countries makes a Mali campaign extremely unlikely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Afghanistan, Western governments (including Canada's) sold intervention on the gossamer wings of making the country democratic, helping girls become educated, raising the standard of living – all of which proved elusive and ultimately disappointing. In Mali, where the democratic government was overthrown and a secessionist group took power in the north, any intervention can have only one objective: killing as many jihadis as possible and uprooting them from their redoubts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except that the jihadis know the terrain. They are well financed, having extorted money from kidnapping. They are utterly fanatical (as former Canadian diplomats and hostages Robert Fowler and Louis Guay discovered during their captivity). They therefore cannot be dislodged from the vast terrain over which they hold sway unless their adversaries put very sizable, sustained military forces on the ground – and then somehow co-ordinate a multinational effort that would have to last for a very long time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Air power alone cannot win this kind of military confrontation. Air power can interdict, slow down and damage an adversary's capacities; only ground forces can occupy territory. And in Canada, as in other Western countries, there is no appetite whatsoever for sending ground forces to Mali.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can understand the frustration, even bewilderment, of France. A <span class="companylink">United Nations Security Council</span> resolution (that the French drafted) authorizes force in Mali and encourages countries to participate. France is responding, with the support of African countries, although not necessarily Arab countries such as Algeria and Tunisia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">France thus far has not received much tangible help from traditional allies such as Britain and Canada. And Germany, as usual, wants as little a part as possible in any serious military intervention. Europe, in other words, is an economic union, with no common foreign policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada has offered one transport plane. It will, quite likely, very cautiously offer a little more.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In my eyes, Dear Abby was – well, let's say, “a transitional figure.” As an advice columnist, I take as much from her example as I do from leaving it behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An advice column is an odd thing to aspire to, especially for a dude. All I knew was that I wanted to be an honest writer, like my heroes Philip Roth, Henry Miller and the open-book blunt Dany Laferrière. The kind of candour these writers muster made me a) laugh and b) feel less alone in the world. “Yes!” I would think as I read, “I'm not the only one who's ever felt that!”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Abigail Van Buren (who died on Thursday) was something else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The history of advice-giving has a humanizing arc: It starts with gods of yore prodding us to do stuff we don't feel like doing (say, through the “Thou Shalts” of the Ten Commandments) and ends up with a I'm-at-least-as-bad-as-y'all Oprah, who admitted on air that she had freebased what we now call crack. Dear Ms. Van Buren, who dominated advice-doling for most of the 20th century, positioned herself somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean she didn't have a crazy story to share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Abigail van Buren was actually named Pauline Esther Friedman. She had a sister, Esther Pauline Friedman, who was born the same day, and got married the same day in a joint ceremony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Esther Pauline wrote a column as “Ann Landers,” and Pauline Esther went to work for her. But soon she developed a taste for dishing out advice herself. She struck out on her own with a rival column under the pseudonym “Abigail Van Buren” – and from there the sisters became rival capos in the advice world, entering into a vicious battle for global domination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sisters didn't speak to each other for years at a time. Although that didn't stop either one of them from dishing out how-to-get-along-with your-relatives advice by the boatload.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, don't get me wrong: I liked Dear Abby and her one-liners. She was salty and sassy, and would sometimes go after readers: Famously, when someone wrote to her to ask how she could improve the neighbourhood now that a gay couple had moved in, she said, tartly: “You could move.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But her whole helmet-haired, pant-suited persona was a construct, a projection, and the WASP-y society matron “Abigail Van Buren” a big, fat fiction. Of course, that's part of the fun, and the meritocratic promise of the American Dream: Create a character out of whole cloth, and that person can be adored by millions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, part of me wished for more from Pauline Friedman, born in Sioux City, Iowa, to Jewish immigrants from Russia. I would have loved to know what she had to say. I would have loved, just once, in response to someone complaining about a competitive brother (“we're in the same business and he's always trying to undercut me”), to read, “I hear ya, man. My sister's always…”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would have been exhilarating. That would have been illuminating. It never happened – mostly, I think, because she was a woman of her time. And I do honour her for bringing all sorts of topics to everyday Americans who had never heard them discussed in a public forum before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we advice columnists tread a weird line between entertainers and ombudspersons. Sometimes we're presented with the most agonizing aspects of the human condition: My marriage has lost its spark; I have a terminal disease; I'm trying to get closure with my son. This stuff simply can't be covered with a one-liner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the future, we need fewer zingers – and more reality and fellow-feeling.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I do enjoy a spot of quinoa now and then. The grain-like seed from the Andes makes a nice backdrop to lamb or fish, and can form a pleasant, if very rich, salad if you augment it with bacon and warm greens.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am far from alone. Twenty years ago, quinoa was pretty much unknown. Now, it's in everyone's cafeteria. Its price is going through the roof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that, in the confused minds of Western foodies, is somehow a bad thing. This week saw a flurry of headlines suggesting that the quinoa boom, unlike any other commodity boom, must somehow be bad for the people on the producing end. “The more you love quinoa,” The Globe and Mail headline read, “the more you hurt Peruvians and Bolivians.” A report in the Guardian chronicled “the unpalatable truth about quinoa,” which is that “poor Bolivians can no longer afford their staple grain.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is nothing quite like food to make us lose all sense of perspective and reason. Behind the killer-quinoa meme you'll find three modern fallacies of food.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First is the idea that success must be bad for the poor. Surely, we think, the quinoa-eating people of the Andes are going to be hurt if they can no longer afford their own crop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The people of the Altiplano are indeed among the poorest in the Americas. But their economy is almost entirely agrarian. They are sellers – farmers or farm workers seeking the highest price and wage. The quinoa price rise is the greatest thing that has happened to them. And it is a deliberate strategy: Quinoa had all but died out as a staple in Bolivia, replaced by beans and potatoes, until farmers began planting it in the 1980s with exports to North America in mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting in 1987, they tapped an export crop that raised living standards, lowered poverty and allowed farmers to move away from the region's other profitable export crop, cocaine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Quinoa fetches a guaranteed high price affording farmers economic stability,” Emma Banks of the Andean Information Network observes. This has given the Andean farmers – formerly one of the most exploited groups in Latin America – new political power, allowing them to win land rights and ecological protection. So when one ecological blog argues that quinoa's “increase in popularity could have negative long-term effects for the farmers that grow it,” what could it mean?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is the second fallacy: That people are better off consuming food grown near them. The “locavore” ideology holds that Montrealers should eat Quebec potatoes and people in La Paz should eat quinoa – and that if they don't, because their success has made it expensive, they should be forced to eat some other local crop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But why wouldn't they use the rising incomes to purchase imported beans, rice, cheese and chicken? In fact, this is exactly what they do. Food is expensive everywhere this year; Peruvians and Bolivians are economizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imported food is often nutritionally better, more affordable, better for the economic development of its producing regions, and less ecologically damaging (because growing in cold countries requires carbon-heavy storage and heating). Peruvians and Bolivians were not better off in the days when they were consuming their own produce – in fact, the Andes region had alarmingly high rates of stunted growth among children, a key indicator of undernourishment. Food protectionism was bad for the poor. So why would we relegate them to a life that was hurting them and that they didn't enjoy?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That leads to the third fallacy of food: Authenticity. The Incas ate quinoa centuries ago, so their descendants should. Now the whole world wants to eat their healthy crop, and they're turning to chicken. Doesn't that somehow make them less authentically Andean?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have relatives on the Nova Scotian side of my family who can remember when lobster was strictly for the dirt-poor – in the eyes of better-off maritimers, it was akin to eating insects. Then the postwar explosion of surf-n-turf dining priced this high-protein food out of their reach. They ate lasagna, pork chops, and macaroni and cheese instead, because the lobster boom had made them less poor. Does anyone think this made them worse off, or less authentically Nova Scotian?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today they're eating quinoa – which tastes pretty good with lobster, as it happens. Being poor may be authentic, but success feels better.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ten-year-old Nathan DeNigris of Ottawa wants to know if the human voice really can break glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ANSWER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mississauga acoustic engineer John Swallow says that, as a student at the University of Toronto, he experimented with exposing glass jars to sound, trying to find defective ones. He thought that perhaps by pounding the jars with sound and making them vibrate, they might break at the weak points. “No such luck, no matter what we did,” he writes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We also took several wineglasses, both cheap and expensive, and blasted each with sound, with no luck, until the sound was tuned like an opera singer's voice to exactly the resonant frequency of the glass, but 100 times louder than a voice. Even then, it took 20 minutes to break a cheap glass. Expensive ones lasted longer.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sound made the wineglasses vibrate and ring like a bell, he says. The vibration caused distortion in the rim of the glass, “with the circular rim alternately flattening in the north-south direction, then in the east-west, a natural vibration mode, all at a pitch of about high C. It was vibrating so much it was a blur,” he writes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, it's obviously very difficult to break glass using sound, but could an unamplified human voice perform the task?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, says Alain Gingras of Notre-Dame-de-la-Salette, Que. He recalls watching an episode of the TV show Mythbusters in which they did succeed in breaking a wineglass with an unamplified human voice. “They had to try and try again,” he writes. “They had to get the right glass, the right singer and the right note.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, singing coach Jaime Vendera, holding the glass up close to his mouth, managed to break it by directing a long, high-pitched note right at it. However, it took him 20 tries before he succeeded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, yes, it seems it is possible to shatter glass with the human voice, but it surely isn't easy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He quotes the following passage from the book Propitious Esculent: The Potato in World History by John Reader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The most valuable asset of the potato is undoubtedly the balanced nutrition it provides.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question I've heard Austin has a great live-music scene. Who should I see and in what clubs?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ANSWER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Texas city easily lives up to its self-proclaimed Live Music Capital of the World billing: you can “shake your thang” at about 200 venues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My favourite venue is the Mohawk because they book great bands,” says Benjamin Wintle, an Austin-based music blogger (austinbloggylimits.com). “I like their urban lumberjack motif and their inside and outside stages. Outside shows are preferable but I've also seen some fantastic shows on the tiny inside stage.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local Latin-folk musician Gina Chavez (ginachavez.com) is also a Mohawk fan. She suggests visitors peruse The Austin Chronicle, a free weekly, for upcoming shows, paying particular attention to some of her other recommended venues. (This is preferably done over coffee at a cool haunt such as Spider House café on Fruth Street).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My favourite is One-2-One Bar on South Lamar,” Chavez says. “It has a great listening environment, plenty of dance space and an incredible sound system. [But] for a funky, free, hippie/hipster vibe, head to the Whip In. Songwriters and bands alike play to intimate crowds every night here – me and my fellow songwriters love this place.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">East Austin's Gypsy Lounge has a large outdoor stage where you can “rock your face off under the stars,” she adds. And if you're into guitar-heavy Texas blues and rootsy Austin Americana, the Saxon Pub is “the best listening room in town – it's got the drinks, friendly vibe and a quiet room for soaking in great music.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to which acts to catch, Wintle says picking favourites is tricky in a scene renowned for its ear-popping diversity. But among many “excellent local bands worth seeing,” he mentions Deep Time, Dana Falconberry, Major Major Major, Nakia, Ume, Quiet Company, Tiger Waves and Shakey Graves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chavez says her must-catch roster includes the “funky, hysterical folk” of Matt the Electrician; the Latin rhythm dance band Hard Proof Afrobeat; and the Carper Family, who she describes as “fab female bluegrass.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wintle says shows run between $10 and $20, generally without those annoying extra fees demanded by <span class="companylink">Ticketmaster</span>. “We're one of the few cities not controlled by them. Our venues operate independently so prices are kept low.” For tickets to hot shows, book ahead using venue websites. Or just see what's on when you arrive in town – popular spots such as the Continental Club offer several acts every night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both agree that timing your visit for a festival can also be an ideal way to immerse yourself in the music scene. But while March's humungous South by Southwest requires major advance planning – especially for accommodation – smaller events such as May's Pachanga Festival or November's Fun Fun Fun are more accessible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless of when you go, don't miss the city's High Fidelity-style record stores. They are nerdtastic spots to get the inside track on Austin's music vibe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My favourite [record shop] is south Austin's End of an Ear,” Wintle says. “It's the perfect neighbourhood shop. Waterloo Records also has a huge selection and highly knowledgeable staff – your best bet [for live recommendations] is to head to their ticket counter.” Breakaway Records and Friends of Sound are also high on his hit list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Austin is not the sort of place you see artists who are well-known. It's the sort of place you see artists who become well-known,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chavez agrees: “This is a place where music thrives. Not the music business, but music itself. Austin is where artists come to discover who they are, who they can be, and who will listen to them.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the end of the 1960s until late this spring, a diner called People's Foods stood on Dupont Street near Davenport Road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the maple-lined streets of the Annex to its south, or of Summerhill just above it, Dupont has for most of its history been a service road – a blue-collar throughway of coal depots, car washes and dry cleaners – a place where manor-born Toronto briefly ceded, of necessity, to the city's working class.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People's was Greek-run and open 24 hours. At nighttime, the cops and fraternity kids who ate there would squint every few minutes as headlights at the top of St. George Street panned north across the cramped little diner's glass facade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People's had six vinyl booths, five stools and a two-storey-high marquee out front that read HAMBURGERS in red block lettering. The burgers were griddled and then charbroiled and served with lettuce, tomato and onion slices – they tasted greasy and beefy, salty and refreshing. They tasted of nostalgia, even if that was never their intention. But then in time, Dupont Street stopped being working class and the rent shot up. Last May, People's Foods' owners moved on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anthony Rose grew up on diner food. Whether at The Drake Hotel, where Mr. Rose was executive chef until last spring, or in New York at the start of his career, he has always looked backward as much as forward. His stock-in-trade is pop classics – the foods of 1940s Chinatown, or old-school bistros, or summer camp – with just enough tweaking to make them new again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I like simple. Get people in, give them a good punch in the face with the food and then you're done,” Mr. Rose told a city food blog a couple of years ago. When the People's space came open, Mr. Rose jumped at it. The place was a perfect fit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rose and Sons opened two months ago. The signs outside are the same, pretty much; the place still looks like a 1960s diner. Mr. Rose kept the interior layout, as well, with booth seating and a small counter. The tiny room is as friendly and as raucous as you'd hope for in a neighbourhood diner. The cooks and the waiter shout orders back and forth across the noisy space, and the amiable kitchen crew often weighs in unbidden on customers' choices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The offerings earlier this week opened with schmaltz, gribenes and fried onions on toast – that's solid chicken fat and deep-fried chicken skin, for the uninitiated. Another appetizer was called “pork chop salad.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mains included fried chicken, a patty melt, steak on garlic toast, cola-braised brisket, and – in a minor concession to the health-conscious – steelhead trout with creamed squash and green sauce. For dessert there was bread pudding and wild blueberries, with or without a triple-thick bacon slice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You become a regular here at extreme mortal peril. Even then, it's tempting. “At most restaurants you have no idea what makes the food taste so good,” a friend announced one night as she pushed back from a plate of what the menu called “soft and sexy grits,” and chopped barbecue pork. It was sweet, salty and deep-caramelized, composed of no less than 40-per-cent hot, jiggly fat. “Here you know exactly what the deliciousness is,” my friend said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fairness, the broccoli with chili and garlic is good, and the “grilled romaine,” which comes dressed in creamy anchovy and garlic dressing, has pretty good crunch, though not quite enough dressing. (I know. You're damned if you do … ) Earlier this month, Mr. Rose did a salad composed of half a lobster and pink horseradish dressing on a handful of sad-looking arugula leaves. Its more recent form, in which the lobster is drenched in tarragon tartar sauce and set over French fries, was far, far better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best course of action is to surrender to the kitchen's maximalism. To wit: the special fried rice, a sweet-salty-greasy mix of rice, egg, ginger, peanuts and “Chinatown sauce,” as the menu calls it. Or the cheddar and apple salad that has half a brick of white cheddar cheese in it, from the taste of things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The “fried chicken in two courses” is very good, as far as cries for help go. The first course consists of meaty wings with drumettes attached, brined with chiles so they're juicy and jammed with flavour. A surprise: quick cucumber pickles on the plate – dill, sweet and salty, delicious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the second course: buttermilk fried chicken thighs over double-butter spaghetti, with a spoonful of sweet tomato sauce on the side. Tasty stuff, though a bracing mound of rapini, or anything green, really, would make it an exponentially better plate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rose's skirt steak looks to British pub tradition, and it's excellent. The steak comes medium rare and aged to the edge of whiffy. (That is praise, not a complaint.) He drops a knob of blue cheese over top. It does a seductive melt into the meat. Underneath the steak, bread fried in a vat of garlicky, sugared butter. There are a couple of sweet, hard-roasted beet wedges, also. They taste like candy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the quintessential death-row dinner. Which, you never know, really. Eat enough of it and your odds are pretty good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only Rose and Sons dish that rivals the steak is the hamburger, which makes me happy for nostalgia's sake. Mr. Rose's rendition is thick around and pink in its middle. He stacks the patty with sweet, slow-caramelized onions, and sandwiches the works in griddle-browned caraway bread. Cooking knows few meetings more magical than beef, fat, salt and caraway – just ask a Jewish deli man.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rose hasn't tried to build a four-star restaurant. Give or take a vegetable or two, it's a superb neighbourhood diner, where the food, as promised, gives the people a good punch in the face. You bloat for a while, you get over it, you want to go back again. Same as diners ever were.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May it become as much of an institution as People's did.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal Ethics Commissioner was right to rule that Finance Minister Jim Flaherty breached the Conflict of Interest Act when he wrote to the CRTC in support of a company based in his riding. But a close look at the case suggests that Mr. Flaherty's error was minor, and it demonstrates the difficulty cabinet ministers face when trying to serve their constituents in their other role as members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flaherty wrote a standard MP's letter in support of a constituent's application for a broadcasting licence; the CRTC invites such comments during the application process. Mr. Flaherty's letter was written on his MP stationery, as opposed to the stationery he might use when writing in his capacity as Minister of Finance. He stated clearly, “As the MP for Whitby-Oshawa, I support their proposal and application.” The wording was neutral; it did not urge the CRTC to take a particular action.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then, after his signature, came the fatal words identifying Mr. Flaherty not only as the riding's MP but also as Minister of Finance and Minister Responsible for the Greater Toronto Area. Had those two lines not been there, there would have been no breach. It is for the inclusion of those words that Mr. Flaherty has rightly apologized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rules exist for a reason: to prevent cabinet ministers from unduly influencing courts and quasi-judicial bodies. They came into being in the wake of a 1994 scandal in which a Liberal cabinet minister wrote the CRTC a similar letter of support that closed with the ominous words, “I trust that you will keep me abreast of developments in this matter.” The minister lost his post; the new rules subsequently brought about the resignation of another Liberal cabinet minister, David Collenette, after he asked the Immigration and Refugee Board to speed up a constituent's case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flaherty's offence was not in the same category. His letter was of the garden-variety type that MPs churn out on their constituents' behalf. There is some speculation that Mr. Flaherty, who has been Minister of Finance for almost seven years, will be moved out of the post later this year. It would be unfair if that were linked to such a relatively small mistake.</p>

If the Americans wish to tie their currency to God, Canadians will tie theirs to their own peculiar religion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Lester Pearson became prime minister of Canada, he told a London audience that hockey had become as much a national symbol as the maple leaf or the beaver. Perhaps he shortchanged the winter game, as maple leaves are not found everywhere in Canada, nor is the beaver. Love of hockey, it appears, is.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This weekend, in rinks in Montreal (vs. the <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span>), Vancouver (vs. <span class="companylink">Anaheim Ducks</span> on Saturday, <span class="companylink">Edmonton Oilers</span> on Sunday), Calgary (Sunday against the <span class="companylink">San Jose Sharks</span>) and Winnipeg (vs. Ottawa), those mouths will be filled with hockey cheers as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story is similar across the country – anger, even fury, at the league owners and players for their greedy squabbling, but the local team excused and embraced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It feels like it did last October,” said an ecstatic Harder as he and his two boys – Cole, 9, and Kade, 6 – warmed up in the basement MTS while waiting for the puck to drop in the real MTS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To suggest <span class="companylink">Winnipeg Jets</span> fans are fanatical is to shortchange the word. Even Kade Harder's middle name is “Jet.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Harder basement rink has a scoreboard – Winnipeg 3, Montreal 0 – and even a replica of the portrait of a young Queen Elizabeth II that hung in the old Winnipeg Arena where the original Jets played before their disastrous relocation to Phoenix.Then there is Blake Simpson, the Lockout Baby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Born as the 2012 Stanley Cup was being decided, he is a lifelong Jets fan – as it appears on his father Brady's <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> account, “Goo Jets Goo!” – and will be sitting high in section 214 when this season finally gets under way, wearing enough Jets gear between Blake and Brady to open their own souvenir store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blake's mother Meghan will be in the couple's other seat, just as committed. She even says, a bit tongue-in-cheek, that the Jets played a part in Blake's existence: She was a member of Leafs Nation, Brady a passionate fan of the <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span>, and their dates often became debates over the bitter Battles of Ontario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was better for our marriage that the Jets came back,” she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We didn't have to fight anymore,” Brady agrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Simpsons have just purchased a home in Brandon so that Brady can be closer to his job at the McCain's french-fry processing factory in Carberry, but they have no plans to give up their $7,300-a-year tickets, despite the two-hour drive to the Jets games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the lockout, Brady says he went through the emotions the media talked about, and he believed they might last even after it ended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was angry,” he says. “I was pissed off. I was happy the season was going to be scratched. But then they got an agreement and after a couple of hours I was happy, I was excited. People were saying we should boycott, but in Winnipeg you can't boycott, because the next guy over is waiting to take your tickets.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Everybody loves hockey too much in Winnipeg,” Meghan adds. “All is forgiven.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geoff Brookes, a Winnipeg accountant who has been a Jets fan since the World Hockey Association days of the 1970s, says there is reason for this, and that it lies deep in the core of the Winnipeg soul. This is a city, he says, that once had visions of grandeur – it was seen as second only to Chicago as a mid-west power – and slipped badly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loss of the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> team in 1996 was seen as confirmation of its failed status, until True North Sports and Entertainment, which owns the <span class="companylink">MTS Centre</span>, convinced the league to try Winnipeg again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The euphoria over the return of our Jets will last a very long time,” Brookes says. “It represents the return of all the hockey memories and the promise of a bright hockey future. It restores our pride in our city and our province. For many of us in Winnipeg and Manitoba that feel this way, the lockout was a side story.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The attitude was ‘We've waited 15 years – what's another four months?'” says Winnipeg Free Press sportswriter Tim Campbell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may well explain Winnipeg, but what explains Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver, where four months of fury toward the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> and its players appeared to evaporate like a bad smell in an elevator once the doors opened? In a new national Canadian Press Harris-Decima poll, 66 per cent said they would watch just as much hockey as they did before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roch Carrier, the beloved author who wrote the story The Hockey Sweater, whose words grace that $5 bill with the kids playing, has said that, if you are a Canadian, “Hockey is life.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does that really mean? “In a land so inescapably and inhospitably cold,” Bruce Kidd and John Macfarlane wrote shortly before the 1972 Canada-Russia Summit Series, “hockey is the dance of life, an affirmation that despite the deathly chill of winter we are alive.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This fall's celebrations of that 40-year-old series ran counter to the anger Canadians felt toward the league and players for denying them their “dance of life.” And it may just be that the re-arrival of hockey in the bleakest time of year, so cold and so dark, has allowed Canadians to somehow compartmentalize their strong feelings for hockey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be mad still at commissioner Gary Bettman and the greedy billionaire owners who shut out the players. Be disappointed still at the millionaire players who fled, laughing, to Europe to take the jobs of those who needed them more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But do not take it out on the game itself – and certainly not, we tend to think, on the home team that, surely, could not have been caught up in such childishness and greed, and only wished to play the game they had played since childhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naive, for sure. Self-delusionary, likely. But no less true for its flaws. The home team can be nothing but good and clean and devoted and, fingers crossed, better this year than last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There definitely was a different feeling around town,” says Jets captain Andrew Ladd. “Just going out shopping or to a restaurant, a lot of excitement now that everyone's going to have something to follow and watch and take pride in again. We as players realize we're a big part of this town and we appreciate the support.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ladd, who stayed and practised in Winnipeg during the lockout, wasn't sure that this would be the case, especially in those dark days in December when it seemed the league and its players were determined to deep-six the season out of greed and spite for each other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Second lockout in seven years?” Ladd says. “You put fans through that – and there were still <span class="companylink">NHL</span> fans here even though they didn't have a team – and there are people who were going to be sour – and rightfully so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's such a hockey-crazy city, you figured they would come back the same way that they were last year, but you never know,” he adds. “You put people in that situation and you don't really know. We're lucky that they'll come back in full force and this place will again be one of the best places to play in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jets centre Bryan Little, who also stayed and practised in the city, says he was never accosted or insulted about the lockout. “It was more just, ‘Okay, get back to work as soon as you can,'” he says. “They were pretty supportive. They were just disappointed that they had finally got their team back and now they couldn't watch them play. That frustrated a lot of people. … I think it would have been a lot worse if we had lost the whole season.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winnipeg, Little says, “is kind of a place where, especially for a player, there's not much else to do apart from play hockey and come to practice. The fans really hold onto that. I think that's why they get so caught up in it. It's a small city and there's not a lot to do and there's not a lot of teams, so it's big.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Everyone's happy now.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And not only, it appears at least this weekend, in Winnipeg. But right across the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps no writer has ever understood Canada better than Bruce Hutchison, who coincidentally was associate editor of the Winnipeg Free Press in the years in which his book, The Unknown Country, so perfectly defined Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I would be the last to disparage the genius of the politicians who make our laws,” Hutchison wrote around that time, “the writers who make our books, the artists who make our pictures, but in gauging the true culture of the nation and reckoning its tensile strength, let the student not neglect hockey.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This hockey story – the week between utter contempt for the league and its players and total embrace of the Canadian teams again – is something that could be studied for an eternity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is why it is best not to wonder why, but merely to drop the puck. In wonder.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a night out at the theatre – or the library, the SkyTrain station, or wherever the performance happens to be – I'll take out-of-the-box disaster over tried-and-true any day. I would far rather sit (or stand) through something that tries to innovate and fails than check my watch through something safe and formulaic that succeeds in a ho-hum kind of way. I realize this is a personal preference, but this is why, for me, January is the most exciting time of year for theatre in Vancouver.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PuSh International Performing Arts Festival is under way, and among this year's many edgy offerings is Winners and Losers. Created and performed by two senior members of the Vancouver indie theatre scene, James Long and Marcus Youssef, it is most definitely out of the box, certainly not safe, and unquestionably not ho-hum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How does it work? Mr. Long and Mr. Youssef sit at a table and play a game they made up called Winners and Losers. One will name a topic or subject – say Tom Cruise or Catholicism or <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> – and the two will debate whether the person, place or thing is a winner or loser. Some of the subjects are set, but many are improvised, making the show unique each night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But soon the debate takes a turn. Instead of deciding whether Pamela Anderson is a winner or loser (“I always maintain that Pam's a winner,” Mr. Long says), the two men – decade-long friends and colleagues – turn the game on themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Once we kind of exhaust the idea of debating Pam Anderson and microwave ovens, we have to get into each other in order to finish the game to bring it to its natural conclusion,” Mr. Long says. “And that's when it gets personal.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the gloves come off, the intensity increases. The guiding theory behind the game is that you can't have two winners sitting next to each other; for there to be a winner, the men reason, there has to be a loser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're very similar in a lot of ways, Marcus and I,” Mr. Long says. “And in order to prove that I'm a loser, in order for him to win, he has to get very mean and cutting and he has to get very deep and honest with me and I have to do the exact same thing with him.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Long, 39, is artistic director at Theatre Replacement. Mr. Youssef, 43, is artistic director of Neworld Theatre. Their companies have been involved in some of the most exciting theatre I have seen in my five years in Vancouver – in particular the Hive shows, Neworld's 2012 adaptation of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's The Idiot, and Theatre Replacement's Clark and I Somewhere in Connecticut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winners and Losers had its world premiere at Gateway Theatre in Richmond in late 2012. Despite the nightly battles – plus rehearsals – the guys seem to have maintained their friendship, although they've had their moments, in particular one show after which followed an awkward silence in their tiny dressing room. As things heated up on stage, there was a look in Mr. Youssef's eyes that had Mr. Long wondering if maybe he'd gone too far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It actually wasn't the personal stuff that I found the hardest,” Mr. Youssef says. “What I found the hardest was the feeling of the times when we'd be in the middle of something and Jamie would go after me and I'd feel like I was losing; I'd feel exposed as a kind of a fundamental loser. … I think we both got really, really sensitive about the potential for appearing like the loser in the piece.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work started out as a more straightforward play: a fictionalized account of two Russian novelists in the Soviet era competing to write the best novel. For a warm-up exercise as they developed the piece at the Russian Hall, Mr. Long and Mr. Youssef made up the winners and losers game – and played it with Russian accents. But when they read through transcripts of the exercise – sans Russian accents – it became apparent that the game itself was a compelling piece of conceptual performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it weren't for PuSh, an out-there work like this might languish without ever finding its way to the stage. Both men credit the festival with not only opening opportunities (Winners and Losers will tour this year to Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal as well as Britain and Ireland) but with creating an environment where this kind of work can be developed, and find an audience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don't think it's possible to overestimate the influence the festival has had on the contemporary scene here in Vancouver,” Mr. Youssef says. “It's influenced the kind of work we see and I know it's had an impact on the kind of work I make. And it's created an audience for work that's more experimental and asks more fundamental questions about the nature of performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The festival, more than any other single cultural entity in the city – at least for the kind of performance we do – has made going to see something that might kind of weird you out a little or might challenge your notions of what performance is, made that feel cool.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PuSh International Performing Arts Festival runs until Feb. 3. Winners and Losers runs Jan. 30 to Feb. 2.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two letters posted on the <span class="companylink">Canadian International Development Agency</span> (CIDA) website were quickly removed after links to them appeared on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> on Tuesday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Dear NDP: CIDA Does Not Need Your Economic Advice,” one of the letters opened, before stating that it is “ironic” that “a party that wishes to impose a $21-billion carbon tax on Canadians … now wants to give advice to developing countries on their economic development.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other letter railed against Liberal policies. Both posts celebrated Conservative initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And both were written (originally as submissions to other publications) by Julian Fantino, the Minister for International Co- operation, who oversees CIDA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It violates policy to use government resources for partisan purposes. Officials speaking on behalf of Mr. Fantino insisted that the posts were made “in error” by bureaucrats casting about for “appropriate Web content” and not at the minister's request.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The officials' tone was, “How could this have happened?” Yet there were two posts, remember. Both were made in mid-December. One was modified somewhat in January. As errors go, this one is not unlike spilling milk, not crying over it, carefully cracking a few eggs on the counter right next to it, coming back after Christmas and making a Béarnaise sauce, then finally applying a damp cloth to the whole mess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increasingly there's a My Favourite Year feel to Mr. Fantino's political career, as Prime Minister Stephen Harper shifts him from post to post. The guy gets moved about like a man in the witness-protection program before a big trial. So it takes some suspension of disbelief to see the minister as a man at the mercy of bumbling CIDA staffers, who, according to Andrew Frenette, director-general of CIDA's communications branch, are “all communication professionals who are keenly aware of the comms policy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They just forgot themselves, we're expected to believe, and posted their boss's correspondence on the CIDA website, perhaps concerned that Canadians, during the holiday season, would find themselves in want of fresh CIDA reading material.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a toss-up – either the document lambasting the “tax and spend NDP” or a young Mr. Fantino's letters home from summer camp: “Dear Mum and Dad, I am ticked right off. I am disgusted and like everyone else outraged. Love, Julian.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Federal operating subsidies to the National Arts Centre must be made contingent on launching a new orchestral series of Stephen Harper Beatles Covers Pops concerts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. MPs' greetings to constituents celebrating 100th birthdays should be replaced by a 400-page omnibus bill that unprotects personal bath water – eliminating red tape for anyone trying to build a dock alongside you while you're reading in the bath.</p>

It's full of exclamation marks! And advice for beautiful sociopaths! About finding love on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> by lying about your whereabouts! While plain girls throw themselves off cliffs like lemmings, because dead is better than dateless! Thank God for progress!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seemed a particularly cruel cosmic joke that just as The New Rules arrives on our weary planet, the voice of sanity known as Dear Abby passes from it. The great scales of wisdom are now sorely out of whack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, 1956, a society matron called Pauline Phillips began writing an advice column for the San Francisco Chronicle under the name Dear Abby, at least partly to get up the nose of her twin sister, who was writing as Ann Landers. For 30 years she dispensed sane, compassionate and occasionally bitchy advice to millions of readers. (Since 1987, Dear Abby has been written by Phillips' daughter, Jeanne, as her mother had Alzheimer's.) In those first 30 years, every dark corner of the human soul was opened to Abby – kleptomania and dipsomania, snoring and bad hygiene, cheating, beating, overeating – and she responded with tolerance, wit and the occasional crack of her sharp tongue. “What do you do with a man who refuses to use a deodorant, seldom bathes, and doesn't even own a toothbrush?” one correspondent asked. “Absolutely nothing!” Abby replied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The collection The Best of Dear Abby, published in 1981, highlights her support for gays (“love and let love”), transsexuals (“a human condition that is tragically buried in ignorance”) and even those pathetic divorcees (“it's more important to save people than marriages”). For a woman born in the last year of the First World War, her attitudes were remarkably modern. She chose letters that she thought would appeal to a wide variety of readers – “the young, middle-aged, elderly, the sophisticates, squares, gays, straights, kooks and conservatives.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's oddly comforting to realize that whatever problems you have now, somebody in Dubuque had the same one 50 years ago – or, as I like to think of it, the great wheel of life crushes us all, and having crushed, rolls on, laughing hysterically. Parents wrote Abby letters agonizing over children who were jobless, pregnant, ungrateful, depressed. She (mostly) advised compassion. One father had stumbled across his son's diary: “I am only interested in being stoned, spending money and sex,” the boy wrote, in a passage that would be deeply unfamiliar to the youth of today. “Be cool,” Abby counselled the dad, “don't put him down or make him feel guilty.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was politically progressive, touting the books of her friend, the muckraking journalist George Seldes, and cosmopolitan: She answered a mother's query about her son's homosexuality by printing one of Freud's letters on the subject. But what's most striking, when you go back and look at the letters, is how much they were about community: families and neighbourhoods and workplaces, and how they might work better. There was none of the narcissism, the laser-like focus on self-improvement, that you find in something like The New Rules (“Long nails will make you feel like a goddess, and so will long eyelashes!”). I now wish I'd written to Abby while she was still with us, because I think I've had only two good pieces of advice in my entire life. The first, before I married, came from a friend who wore her best don't-shoot-the-messenger face: “You should probably learn to bite your tongue,” she said. The second, before I had my first child, came from my sister-in-law, who grabbed my arm and hissed: “You must tell the doctor that everyone in this family has a very large head.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'd add my own two cents for any expectant mothers, perhaps the only piece of advice I'm qualified to give: If the government is paying for the drugs, take them. I feel that Dear Abby, modern woman that she was, would have agreed.</p>

The tennis courts will be full, people will be wearing shorts, the laptops will migrate to the outdoor tables.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's exactly the kind of weather that makes Vancouverites smug.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does it mean winter is over? Don't bet on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've seen more than a couple of February snowfalls that have wiped the smirks off the faces of beach volleyball players mid-spike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like anyone who's lived here for even a few years, city councillor George Affleck knows that it takes just a couple of centimetres of snow to bring this city to its knees. He also knows that the city's plan for dealing with snow is less than ideal. This week, Mr. Affleck brought a motion to council born out of our mid-December brush with winter and this week's slippery morning commutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of this is no doubt a reaction to the outrage that followed December's relatively minor – but paralyzing – snowfall, when it was learned that some streets that also happen to be dedicated bike routes may have been given priority when it came to snow clearing. Hard to swallow for people trying get up their own side streets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A larger part of it, though, comes from the fact that when it does snow in this city, people understandably tend to leave their cars at home and rely on transit – which is, well, unreliable. We know that by the forlorn faces of people huddled at bus stops, while down the route and out of view, hobbled trolley buses are pulled over to the side of the road. We saw that last month. We've seen it many times in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Invariably, Translink blames road conditions and especially a lack of snow-clearing at bus-stops for its failure to keep buses moving, rather than the fact that its buses may not be designed or equipped to handle a Canadian winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also blames car drivers who have the audacity to take to the roads for clogging up traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with Translink providing spotty service, what choice do they have?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his motion, which was unanimously endorsed by council this week, Mr. Affleck makes the point that we have to stop looking at snowfalls and icy conditions as rare occurrences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He cites a report by city staff that followed what's become known (unofficially) as Snowmageddon four years ago. The report plays down Vancouver's winter woes, noting that only eight major winter storms have hit the city in the past 140 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's not the “once-in-20-years” storms we need to worry about. It's the not-at-all-rare surprise dusting of light snow, or the frosty mornings when the temperature drops below zero, turning the streets into skating rinks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city invariably insists its efforts to salt and brine and sand the roads have been a success. The fact that cars keep slamming into each other must be unrelated to the state of the roads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, whatever the city is doing isn't working, or working to the expectations of people who live in a major Canadian city. If it were working, buses would be on time and basic services like garbage pick-up wouldn't have to be put on hold, crippled by frost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I grew up in Ottawa, where snow clearing occurs with military precision and is carried out by an army of graders, sidewalk plows, snow blowers, dump trucks, and front end-loaders. It is something to behold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not expecting the same effort or suggesting that anything even close is needed in this city. It wouldn't make any sense to spend millions of dollars on equipment that would be called into action just a few days a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But people do expect the city to do better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transit has to be at its best when people need it the most.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city has to do everything it can to keep the buses, and everything else, moving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not good enough to point fingers and lay blame and suggest that only people who really need to go to work should venture out.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who can turn the world on with her smile? Who can take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile? Well, it's you, girl, and you should know it!</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty years ago, Mary Tyler Moore invented the modern young career woman. She lived alone. She didn't need a man to make her happy. She had her friends instead. Unlike a family, her friends were always there for her. “Fictive kin,” we call them now. She loved her job and thrived at it. Since it was the '70s, whatever sex life she had was offstage, but we presume that it was happy and wholesome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Mary would live in someplace like Liberty Village, the hippest, most happening condo development in Toronto. She would have a gym membership and a little dog, which would wear a little coat and booties in the winter. Her little condo might not even have a dining room table in it, because communal dining is mostly done in restaurants now. For dinner, she'd get takeout, and eat it in the living room while she cruises <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and answers her e-mail. As for her sex life – well, she's a modern woman. She pretends commitment doesn't matter. But she's 35 now, and she's getting anxious. Why can't she meet somebody decent?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singlehood used to be a short life stage between finishing school and getting married. Now that stage is getting longer and longer and longer, and sometimes permanent. In Canada, single households now outnumber households with couples and kids. As The Globe's week-long examination of single living found, singles buy 70 per cent of the units in many condo developments. In Britain, according to the Daily Mail, “the number of 25- to 45-year-old women living alone has doubled over the past two decades, with twice as many single women buying properties as single men.” If you believe the self-reports, most of these people are deliriously happy. They're independent and empowered. They paint their bedrooms pink. They don't worry about having kids. They buy great clothes, take great trips, and don't want anyone to cramp their style. They'd never dream of making someone else the centre of their life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, yeah, and another thing. They're incredibly lonely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that they'll admit it. Saying you are lonely is worse than saying you have cancer. People don't want to hear it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have a close friend who works with a lot of single women in their 30s, and up. Most are never-married, a few are divorced, and one or two have had a kid on their own. She says that all of them would prefer to be in a permanent relationship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not much different with the men. None of the married men I know envy single men – they pity them. The longing for long-term intimate connection is a near-universal impulse. Even the most inveterate playboys eventually get married. The only people who escape these yearnings are people (usually men) who are in some way autistic, or asexual. We are born and bred to be pair-bonded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a world of difference between being single at 26, and being single at 36. I know. At 26, I was thrilled to be me. I had a promising career and an interesting and varied romantic life (though not half as interesting as I had hoped). I was determined never to depend financially on a man. I wasn't drawn to motherhood, and marriage was the last thing on my mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 36, being me was not so thrilling any more. I was bored with my own company. Eating leftover roast chicken in front of the TV had lost its charm. A bookish introvert by nature, I was turning into a recluse. The single men – where were they all? – had all but dried up. Eventually it dawned on me that unless I took drastic action, I faced a future as a cat lady. That's the difference a decade makes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even at the best of times, the single life is overrated. It's not like Sex and the City. It's more like Girls. The parties are depressing and the sex tends to fall dramatically short of expectations. As Girls creator Lena Dunham told The Independent, “It's hard for me to write from a place of fantasy to see sex as glamorous. I think it can be kind of a battleground.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big thing people get wrong about being single is to imagine that singlehood allows you to define and perfect yourself, and that discovering who you really are is the most important task there is. As one 37-year-old man told The Globe's Zosia Bielski, “You're trying to get yourself right before you move on to the next stage of your life.” Or, as Carrie Bradshaw put it in her final voice-over, “The most exciting, challenging and significant relationship of all is the one you have with yourself. And if you find someone to love the you you love, well, that's just fabulous.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I used to think that way, too. But now I know I was exactly wrong. Self-love is not, in fact, the greatest love of all. And the road to self-actualization isn't through perfection of the independent self, but through imperfect, messy, long-term relationships. Everybody needs someone else to nurture, and someone to stand up for them, and someone to plan the future with, and someone with whom they share a past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You won't always get what you want, and you won't always come first. But is that so awful? The wonderful and rewarding parts will probably outweigh the hard and awful parts. You will be astonished by the person you become. And you wouldn't exchange the richness of your married life for anything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're only 26, you won't believe me. But you'll see.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's been a disturbing absence of civic place-making honouring aboriginal culture in northwestern Ontario. Buried for too long, the influence of native design – both historical and contemporary – has been finally expressed in a beautiful narrative set down on the north shore of Lake Superior. As part of a transformed, publicly accessible waterfront now complete in Thunder Bay, Ryan Gorrie, an Ojibway architecture graduate, has worked poetry with traditional bentwood, a material once honed by his ancestors, to craft a lyrical vessel that is open to the city and the waters beyond.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's unique to this redevelopment is the way it honours the local aboriginal wish to create an “inclusive circle” between all people and nature. Besides offering a magnetic and meditative use of waterfront land, it is exactly the kind of physical presence that declares to Canadians and the rest of the world that aboriginal culture matters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Spirit Garden is set in downtown Thunder Bay on reclaimed industrial land – not far from a site where aboriginal settlements are estimated to date back some 9,000 years. In the distance spreads ocean-scaled Superior and, beyond, Nanabijou, the land mass also known as the Sleeping Giant. Two centuries ago, this port was a shipping terminus and gateway to Western Canada. More recently, a marina with private boats moored along the gigantic piers has operated here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in 2006, a group of local business people calling themselves the Ambassadors recommended the creation of a vibrant waterfront that would, at last, be publicly accessible. Prince Arthur's Landing, as the new development came to be called, might have just been a matter of a pretty reclamation. But this is one of those rare initiatives that seamlessly integrates modernity with a traditional aesthetic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iconic land art – two 21-metre-tall Corten steel beacons by Winnipeg's BLDG/spmb architects – rise like thin black blades from Piers 1 and 3, merging with granite seating into which is carved aboriginal poetry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gorrie's Gathering Circle bentwood structure rises from a meandering headland nearby. From a distance, it appears like a curved proscenium, woven from green, easily malleable spruce trees. The spruce were harvested in the summer, the bark stripped off and the wood bent into structural trusses immediately after.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the bentwood tradition has been lost, so the architects were forced to look hard for a knowledgeable craftsperson. They found a builder living in British Columbia, who returned to his native Fort William First Nation reserve to craft the spruce trusses. Not surprisingly, Idle No More protests have also been cranking up the volume this winter within the Gathering Circle's embrace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of Pier 2, past tree-lined walkways and elevated wooden art boxes, is the viewing circle: a titled disc of land directing views toward Nanabijou. The disc measures some 24 metres in diameter and provides green space for ceremonies, blessings, music. Engraved into the perimeter of the circle is a poem, Round Dance, by aboriginal writer Sarain Stump. Don't break this circle/Before the song is over/Because all of our people/Even the ones long gone/Are holding hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revitalization of Thunder Bay's historic port holds important lessons for other cities struggling to create joyous public space along previously industrialized waterfronts. Heritage has been retained – and renovated – to allow a circa-1900 brick structure to become the Baggage Building Arts Centre, a two-storey public gallery that incorporates studios and retail. The Water Garden Pavilion, defined by a contemporary design vocabulary that uses fine textures of wood with light-giving glass, fronts onto a summer splash pool and winter skating rink. There is a skateboard park, and dedicated running and cycling trails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the Prince Arthur's Landing mixed-use development, an eight-storey hotel is currently under construction along with two similar-size residential buildings. The modest scale is intended to blend easily with the rest of the downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The waterfront design resists clichéd aboriginal-literal motifs (a metal-clad tepee, say, or sculptures of bison). Instead, with multilayering and subtlety, it allows abstraction to breathe and the power of nature to resonate. To that end, large ash logs are used as seating in an informal amphitheatre next to the bentwood Gathering Circle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The force of the design comes, importantly, from four ideas-intensive charrettes sensitively organized by the site's master planners and architects, Brook McIlroy of Toronto and Thunder Bay . Representatives from Fort William First Nation, Robinson-Superior Treaty Communities and the Red Sky Métis participated. Early on, Calvin Brook, the lead design principal, made the acquaintance of Gorrie, then a University of Manitoba architecture student, who was participating in one of the preliminary charrettes. Brook noticed his design talent, and invited him to “champion” the open-air pavilion. Gorrie knew little about his Ojibway culture, having grown up in Thunder Bay, where, the 31-year-old says, “there was a shame with being an Indian.” But the cultural grounding and academic offerings at the U of Manitoba had awakened a pride in Gorrie, and he started to work on his Ojibway language there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In British Columbia, from UBC's First Nations House of Learning to the controversial use of the Inukshuk for the 2010 Winter Olympics – the expression of aboriginal cultural is a powerful brand promoted by the province</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not so in northwestern Ontario. “There's a lot of racism that still exists,” says Brook. But building civic identity is easily done, especially when the optimism and expertise of aboriginals are harnessed. His firm continues to collaborate with aboriginal design experts while expanding its practice north of Thunder Bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every civilization depends on mind-altering images of itself. Without aspirational architecture and meaningful places to gather, a society risks annihilation – a little bit every day. That makes more sense than ever to architect-intern Gorrie. “The health of a culture is measured by what you can visibly see,” he says. “This is a small part of the decolonization process.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The English actor James Purefoy, an impressive figure in a fine suit, moves around the crowded Fox network party smiling uneasily. A <span class="companylink">Royal Shakespeare Company</span> veteran best known over here for his role as Mark Antony in HBO's Rome, he's not entirely comfortable in the noisy, meet-and-greet atmosphere.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's here to talk up The Following (starting Monday, Fox, CTV, 9 p.m.) with TV critics, and it's hard for him to hear questions in the clamour. Asked if he has any qualms about the show, he blurts out, “I like TV that grabs you by the throat. That's the best kind of television and that, I hope, is what The Following is.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then he sees another actor from the drama, 10-year-old Kyle Catlett, and he beams and embraces the boy. He's happily lost to the critics and their questions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a sweet vignette, this scene, but slightly unnerving to those of us who have seen The Following. In it, Purefoy plays Joe Carroll, a seductive serial killer, a university professor with a passion for Edgar Allan Poe and a man with a group of followers who will do his vicious bidding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Young Catlett plays his son, a boy he hasn't seen for years but who becomes a pawn in a deeply creepy game played out by Carroll's followers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The killer and the kid: The show is about more than that, but The Following has become a flashpoint in the debate over the impact of violent entertainment on children and on the U.S. culture at large. It has some of the most graphic murder scenes ever seen on network TV. In post-Newtown-and-Aurora-shootings America, The Following seems shockingly raw to some. It has been called “stomach-churning” by one critic. No wonder – in one defining scene, a Joe Carroll follower strips naked, pierces herself in the eye and kills herself by applying an ice-pick to her head.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While The Following was conceived more than a year ago, it now lands in prime time during a perfect storm of controversy about the glorification of violence on TV, in movies and in video games. Episodes of some TV shows were pulled off the air in the immediate aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in Newtown, Conn. Movie trailers were pulled and premieres postponed. There was visceral sensitivity about violent entertainment, and it has not gone away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a frenzy of finger-pointing going on. On the one hand, conservative pundits, bluntly opposed to new gun laws, blame the entertainment industry for de-sensitizing everyone. Columnist Charles Krauthammer, in a much-published and discussed column, fulminated, “We live in an entertainment culture soaked in graphic, often sadistic, violence.” Out on the fringes, the “Newtown truthers,” fevered Internet conspiracy theorists, go so far as to claim the Sandy Hook shootings were a hoax enacted by the TV industry in collusion with the Obama administration to enforce new gun laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so The Following, the first heavily promoted new drama of 2013, is set to air while the U.S. grapples with gun violence, and the National Rifle Association and its supporters point to violent TV, movies and video games as a scourge. TV is a target for those who want to shift all discussion of causality away from guns and gun owners toward the impact of popular culture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the National Rifle Association commented on the Sandy Hook shootings, NRA executive-vice-president Wayne LaPierre notoriously implicated Hollywood, whose intent, he said, is to “violate and offend every standard of civilized society by bringing an ever-more-toxic mix of reckless behaviour and criminal cruelty into our homes – every minute of every day of every month of every year.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, that notion is rejected by Kevin Williamson, The Following's creator (also responsible for Dawson's Creek and the Scream movies). “Who wasn't affected by Sandy Hook? I'm still disturbed by Aurora,” he told critics at the Fox event. “We sat in the writers' room and we were all affected by it. … It's very disturbing. But I'm writing fiction. I'm just a storyteller.” He also pointed out that his mother, an avid reader who encouraged him to be a writer, gave him Poe's work to read when he was 12 years old. He remembers his schoolteacher being disturbed by his reading material, but his mother was not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Following is shockingly good, it should be said. A 10-episode thriller of originality and fiercely timed, fast-paced twists, it's clearly a network's attempt to compete with the must-see, adult dramas of HBO and Showtime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Essentially, it's about a good guy chasing a bad guy. Kevin Bacon, in his first TV role, plays drink-addled, semi-retired FBI agent Ryan Hardy. It was his pursuit and capture of Joe Carroll, years before, that broke him. Carroll had murdered 14 female students on a college campus where he taught literature. Now Joe Carroll has escaped, and Hardy is drawn into the chase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's truly disturbing in the show is the emergence of Carroll's twisted, murderous followers. It is relentless in its stark depiction of people who wallow in the approval of a madman. Viewers who invest in a seemingly sympathetic character may soon find that the character is secretly evil, capable of horrific violence or soon to be murdered. Put that bleakness together with the graphic violence, remember that The Following airs at 9 p.m. on an easily accessible TV network, and the controversy about it is easily explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Fox's party for the show, the issue of the impact of TV violence wouldn't go away. Williamson's blunt declaration that he was just writing fiction was met with a critic's point that since the Columbine shootings there's a consensus that “a percentage of our children are disconnected from emotion, are dangerous.” And that TV entertainment might be part of the reason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Williamson rightly suggested in reply that he actually deals with that issue in The Following. “It's meant to be a thriller with a provocative story at its root. But I understand the question,” he says. “What happened in Columbine in a lot of ways inspired this, in a weird way. It's sort of shining a light on some of those kids or some of those minds … Joe Carroll is this magnetic character and he can sort of pinpoint what's missing in your life, what that little hole is and he can fill it. If you can find someone that can fill that void and that space in you, then you might be willing to follow them to a really dark place, and I think that's the terrain of the show.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fox network chief Kevin Reilly, who has a lot riding on The Following – he needs a successful drama in his lineup – was also dismissive of accusations that the drama goes too far. “If you put this series through the filter of [the network's] Broadcast Standards [and Practices Department], there's nothing on that show we even had to fight over,” Reilly said. “I didn't call the Standards and Practices Department and say, ‘Buckle up, this one's pushing the boundaries.'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked if the national revulsion after the Sandy Hook and Aurora shootings caused him to re-think future shows – Fox like other networks is going into pilot season – he said he couldn't be unaware, but rejected a direct connection between the shootings and the entertainment TV offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You have to absorb everything,” he asserted. “We're in the culture business. You are constantly monitoring cultural shifts, current events, shifts in mores, things that reflect society. That is, we both reflect society and, at times, we try to drive it. It comes with a responsibility. I don't like to trivialize an issue by drawing a direct linkage between anything, but we take everything we do, everything we put on the air, with the utmost responsibility.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there's the issue in a nutshell. Reilly, like other network execs, rejects the passing of blame to the entertainment industry for for the violence in the U.S. At the same time, he has to be sensitive to shifts in the culture. He's putting a show in prime time about a character, Joe Carroll, whose philosophy is summarized as, “The only way to truly live is to kill.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At its core, the issue here is about fiction. James Purefoy isn't a killer. He plays one on TV in an intense drama that is a work of the imagination. When he embraces his 10-year-old fellow actor at a party, that's real. It's not fiction. There's a difference, no matter how loud the noise is about The Following. No matter how much the NRA and its supporters want to shift the blame.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Lewis, head of the Ontario Provincial Police, is being accused of undermining the rule of law. A respected judge, David Brown of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, has questioned the force's “passivity” in its delay in enforcing his injunction meant to end an aboriginal blockade on a rail line between Toronto and Montreal. That delay, Judge Brown said, “leads me to doubt that a future exists in this province for the use of court injunctions in cases of public demonstrations.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judge Brown's frustration is understandable, and widely shared by the public. But he is not standing in Mr. Lewis's shoes. Mr. Lewis is determined to use his discretion wisely. He heads a force that made mistakes at a 1995 native occupation at Ipperwash Provincial Park – mistakes that led to a police officer shooting an unarmed native man, Dudley George. Those mistakes occurred after the premier, Mike Harris, said, “I want the fucking Indians out of the park.” The province later spent three years and $25.6-million on a judicial inquiry into where things went wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We don't understand what the protesters who block roads or rail lines expect to accomplish. They can only undermine support for their cause among Canadians. A co-founder of the Idle No More movement has said as much. The justice system – including judges and police – should stand up to these protesters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But edicts are easy. The OPP have multiple risks to confront. “I'd rather be criticized for a decision to not jeopardize, take or lose lives than for taking unnecessary aggressive action that undoubtedly will,” Mr. Lewis said, in a videotape circulated to OPP members and available to the public on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>. Aboriginal protesters, he said, could “paralyze this country” through blockades if they choose – meaning that a careful, negotiated approach is the best one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ontario Court of Appeal was faced with a similar dispute over aboriginal blockades in Caledonia in 2006. It said the police and the Crown, not judges, are in the best position to determine how to do their job. “The immediate enforcement and prosecution of violations of the law may not always be the wise course of action or the course of action that best serves the public interest.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is lucky to have police leaders like Chris Lewis, who understand that authority is more than brute force, and that police need to move carefully, lest they undermine the rule of law even as they try to uphold it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the nearly nine years since the <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span> last made the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> playoffs, how often could you say this: Their homegrown players are their best ones.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Granted, it's early, but as the Leafs prepare for Monday night's home opener at the Air Canada Centre against the <span class="companylink">Buffalo Sabres</span>, that is the most encouraging sign they might be ready to finally shake off their status as a perennial doormat. In the Leafs' 2-1 win over the host <span class="companylink">Montreal Canadiens</span> on Saturday, a group of graduates from their Toronto Marlies farm team stole the show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Centre Nazem Kadri, his linemate, Leo Komarov, goaltender Ben Scrivens and, most notably, defenceman Mike Kostka led the way for the Leafs. Does this mean they will make meaningful contributions in this 48-game season, or did they just get a temporary head-start on some rusty NHLers by playing in the <span class="companylink">American Hockey League</span> during the lockout?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the sloppy play in Saturday's game and the feeble opposition put up by the Canadiens it is far too early to draw any conclusions. A better indication will come after Monday's game because the Sabres are a much better opponent than the Canadiens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, the contributions of the newly promoted farmhands are encouraging, particularly in the cases of Kostka and Komarov. They both played their first <span class="companylink">NHL</span> games on Saturday at the relatively advanced ages of 27 and 25, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Komarov is a Leaf draft pick from the seventh round of the 2006 <span class="companylink">NHL</span> entry draft, it is a stretch to call Kostka a home-grown player. He was signed as a free agent last summer and put in a long apprenticeship in the AHL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kostka looked comfortable from the start playing beside Leafs captain Dion Phaneuf, who is the same age as Kostka but took a much quicker route to the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> albeit with his own learning struggles. Kostka showed he can play an <span class="companylink">NHL</span> power play as well as an AHL one with an assist on Kadri's power-play goal. He also knows how to play in his own end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leafs head coach Randy Carlyle showed his confidence in Kostka by giving him 22 minutes, 59 seconds of ice time, second only to Phaneuf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I thought Mike Kostka was a dominant player,” Carlyle said. “He played a lot of minutes, didn't make a lot of mistakes, looked like a guy comfortable playing in this situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It really is astounding he hasn't played a game before [Saturday] in the league.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kostka also made an impression on his defence partner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He moves the puck well, he's vocal, he is a smart, smart player,” Phaneuf said. “You can see how strong he is on pucks and that's why he's here.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It remains to be seen if Kostka will remain with Phaneuf on the Leafs' top defence pair and if his skating is good enough for the long haul. But if he can be a useful member of the defence for the entire season it will give the Leafs one of the best value-for-salary ($600,000 U.S.) signings of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kadri showed a more complete game than he did in previous stints. It looks like the Leafs just may have one of the best third lines in the league with Kadri between James van Riemsdyk and Komarov, with the latter looking like a real find.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He's the workhorse, that guy,” Kadri said of Komarov, who had nine points in 14 games with the Marlies this season. “It seems he never stops working, never stops skating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I had the chance to create some chemistry [with Komarov] before, down with the Marlies. I know what he can do, what his strengths are and I'm going to try and play toward that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scrivens, 26, did not play so well fans will stop hollering for general manager David Nonis to trade for Roberto Luongo already but he did accomplish what is expected of himself and colleague James Reimer. Don't kill the confidence of this young team with too many mistakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We don't ask our goaltenders to win the hockey game. We ask our goaltenders to give us a chance,” Carlyle said. “I thought Ben Scrivens gave us a chance.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As noted, one game is too small of a sample size for conclusions but the signs are positive for a change. In the short, 48-game term, there is hope the farmhands will combine with the stars for a playoff run. In the long run, there is hope the Leafs' development program is finally paying off.</p>

Just over a week ago, millions of Haitians commemorated this tragedy in honour of family members, friends and colleagues they lost on Jan. 12, 2010.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After three years, some of you are asking: Why continue to help Haiti with donations or even through government aid? Has the money really helped the country, since it still seems to be faced with so many problems?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, let me thank you for your help. Canadians have been very generous toward Haiti after the earthquake and, thanks to you, our most vulnerable people have received food, drinkable water, shelter, medical care and education. For that, we are extremely grateful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, you should know that Haiti is in a better position today than it was 20 months earlier, when President Michel Martelly took office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We still face many problems and challenges, but nearly 80 per cent of the people living in camps after the earthquake are now returning to their communities, while 95 per cent of the debris has been collected. We started rebuilding our ministries and other public administration buildings, as well as our schools and hospitals. We have launched significant programs, such as social safety nets for the most vulnerable, subsidized by the government itself, and they have already reached more than four million people in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have dismantled five of the largest criminal organizations in the country, and this is reflected in our crime statistics. We are strengthening our police force, and technological resources. Haiti has the same homicide rate as Long Beach, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have introduced free education at the primary level, and 1.27-million children now attend school free of charge. For many of them, this is the first time. We will also teach reading and writing to more than 300,000 adults in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We rebuilt the main airport in Port-au-Prince and are upgrading three others near tourism centres. We are building hundreds of kilometres of roads. We are investing in health care and drinkable water, and we have put in place a plan to eradicate cholera. In the last week of December, cholera cases accounted for only 7 per cent from the peak reached in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have maintained a stable economy, and have opened a new industrial park in the north of the country. Foreign investments were up 21 per cent in 2012, compared with 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This brings me to my third point. Although we are very grateful, we would prefer not being dependent on your goodwill. What we really want, what we would prefer above all, is that your private sector invests in Haiti to create jobs that would generate much-needed tax revenue for the government. What we would prefer is that you spend your holidays in Haiti to support the tourism industry. You are welcome, and you will be safe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will take time before our government's vision bears fruit, and we need your help to get there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The earthquake marked us, without a doubt. But it does not define us. Haiti is not a case study in development. Haiti is 10.4-million people, of whom 35 per cent are children under 15. The country has always had great potential – and this is still the case. Our ill fortune has long been a matter of bad governance. And now things have changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a new government, and a new approach to doing things that is dedicated to fixing past mistakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are working tirelessly to curb corruption. We have reduced administrative costs in order to maximize the impact of programs in key sectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To face our challenges, we have defined a national strategic development plan. We know what is wrong, and are working toward overcoming our challenges. We seek nothing less than to support our people and care for them. We need partners like Canada to achieve this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We want our nation to rise. For the moment, we can't do it without your help.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘Hostile Manitoba.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The caller is venting, as have a half dozen before and would several dozen more already on hold or just dialling in to the <span class="companylink">Winnipeg Jets</span> postgame show on Saturday evening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This one wants the provincial licence plate changed: Strike “Friendly” and insert “Hostile” to better reflect the feel-bad concerns of Saturday evening that were drowning out the feel-good sentiments of the afternoon as the Jets held their home opener against the <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a game so bad that Ottawa Senators coach Paul MacLean diplomatically described it as “a dog's breakfast.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jets forward Blake Wheeler was less diplomatic, accurately describing his team's 4-1 loss as “ugly.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the fans spoke up. In the afternoon they had arrived at the <span class="companylink">MTS Centre</span> two hours early to line up in -26 windchill and swirling snow gusts. They came in painted faces and replica jerseys and carried Thundersticks and sang and danced and cheered with sheer delight that the hometown heroes were finally back on the ice and winter could be put back in its proper place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the evening, they called in to the radio talk show. Someone wanted an “APB” put out on Kyle Wellwood. Another wanted one put out on Bryan Little. Both forwards had been invisible, though they were hardly alone among the Jets in turning in weak performances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The odd fan called for calm, saying it was but one game out of 48, saying the team – the <span class="companylink">Atlanta Thrashers</span> until fall 2011, when they relocated to Winnipeg – is in a rebuilding phase that will likely take five years. They have good draft picks coming up – six in the first three rounds this June – and it is going to take time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other callers were having none of it. They didn't like the forwards, they didn't like the defence, they didn't like the goalie. One caller said he'd wasted $200 on tickets to the home opener.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The only good thing about the night,” said another, “was the half-price beer.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Out-of-town listeners dared wonder – shudder, cringe – if the honeymoon was over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To those who have closely watched the triumphant return of the Jets to Winnipeg, such a possibility seemed nothing less than shocking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This, after all, is the city that waited patiently for a second chance at the NHL. It took 15 years and some smart and sophisticated ownership by True North Sports &amp; Entertainment to pull it off, but they did, and Winnipeg spent a delirious first year cheering their new heroes in what was soon described as “the loudest building in the NHL.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that the <span class="companylink">MTS Centre</span> seats only 15,004, tickets were at a premium from the very first. They set a goal of selling 13,000 season tickets and the requests were so heavy it crashed the computers. All 13,000 were snapped up in minutes. They then established a waiting list and had to cut it off at 8,000 with thousands more wanting on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Jets would never again be lost. The honeymoon, it was said, would last a good five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not so fast. Saturday afternoon the Jets laid a stinker in front of these rabid fans. It seemed but a single Jets player, Dustin Byfuglien, was even aware the lockout was over. To be fairer to the Jets, however, it needs to be pointed out that the Senators were also rusty, sloppy and fatigued by the third period, as might be expected in a season that had a four-month delay. This game was roughly the quality of a preseason match.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there was a difference maker, it was Ottawa goaltender Craig Anderson, who let in the first goal of the game, a point blast from Byfuglien on the power play, but played superbly from then on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most importantly, it is both the first game and but one game. One game does not a season make.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, in a truncated 48-game season, one game can a season break, especially if league parity produces a final stretch where, as has been happening in recent years, there is a mad scramble for that final playoff spot in each conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such a compressed timetable makes panic a player. If it reared its head in Winnipeg Saturday, it was no different in places like Detroit (downed 6-0 by the <span class="companylink">St. Louis Blues</span> Saturday), Washington (beaten 6-3 by the <span class="companylink">Tampa Bay Lightning</span>), Vancouver (whipped 7-3 by the <span class="companylink">Anaheim Ducks</span>) and likely a few other places where early expectations plunged to early concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter what becomes of the 2013 season, it will be a roller-coaster ride like never before seen. Particularly with a new panic button – social media – in play as much for the regular season as it was for the lockout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Need proof? All that has to happen in Winnipeg is that things turn around for the Jets Monday night in Boston or Tuesday night in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the Jets will find themselves right back in “Friendly Manitoba.”</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And “Indeed!” say we all. Come tonight, the best and bloodiest new network drama in years begins its assault on viewers. That's The Following (Fox, CTV, 9 p.m.) and, as I reported in a lengthy epistle in Saturday's paper, it's a tad controversial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Controversial mainly because it's scary, is the gist. But what's scary, anyway? Fictional serial killers or real snakes, scorpions and killer water bugs? Let's dwell on that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, put the yackety-yack about The Following aside and you've got a good show. It's not for the squeamish or those who prefer their police procedurals to plod. And not for those who might be irritated that the plot commands them to look up the works of Edgar Allan Poe in order to determine where the murder and mayhem is rooted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charming killer Joe Carroll (James Purefoy) is the Poe scholar, the one unleashing unspeakable horror through his followers. Melancholy and sometimes drunk FBI agent Ryan Hardy (Kevin Bacon) is the guy on his tail, a man ensnared years before in Carroll's web of rage and murder. Disturbing events unfold, but this drama is not anchored in the ponderous paranoia that sets the tone on Criminal Minds or the CSI shows. The rapid pace and revelation of the breadth of the killer's reach is what keeps it going. The speed is designed to make the viewers both gripped and uneasy, and it works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there comes a point where, if you stick with it, Edgar Allan Poe is a central figure. The series dwells on an adolescent interpretation of Poe's morbid, dark romanticism, but it is not empty-headed. The Following is escapism of the warped kind, plot-driven but eventually character-driven, too. (The intensity of the connection between the killer and the cop is unnerving and vaguely homoerotic.) Me, I don't buy into the hogwash that is the condemnation of Fox for airing a gory, scary show in prime time. It's frightening but in a fabulous way. It's invention, not a real investigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it compels us to ask: What does frighten people?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wild Things with Dominic Monaghan (OLN, 9 p.m.) also starts tonight and features scenes that will scare many people way more than any actor playing a serial killer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monaghan is the English actor best known for Lost, The Lord of the Rings movies and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. At the start of the program – made for BBC America – he declares that, apart from acting, his passion is creepy-crawly killers. And the first one he sets out to meet is the giant water bug, found in Vietnam, which is only 7.5 centimetres long but can kill creatures 10 times its size. It's an ugly little critter with razor-sharp pincers and an ability to inject toxins that liquefy the innards of its prey. Bloody terrifying, actually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we meet Monaghan in a lake in Vietnam with 120 crocodiles. But he's ignoring the killer crocs and looking for an encounter with that giant water beetle. Then we go back to the beginning of his journey – he sets out along the Mekong Delta and, of course, natters on about Apocalypse Now, his favourite move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pretty soon he sees a giant snake up a tree. “Ooh look at the size of that snake,” he cries. Next thing you know, he's up the tree getting all touchy-feely with an enormous python. “Ooh, look at the size of its head,” he cries. The python then breathes into his ear. “What a stupendous and beautiful animal,” Monaghan whispers. And you might well be at home replying, “Ooh, that's horrible and disgusting.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other adventures in what is a travel show as much as a critter show, he meets a water scorpion and a deadly cobra to which he introduces himself by saying, “woo-hoo-hoo!” The cobra gets ticked off by the camera and all that “woo-hoo” stuff. In an adventure almost as dangerous, he also buys a Manchester United shirt in a Ho Chin Minh City market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then he dines at a restaurant that serves “steamed penis and balls of goat” and, later, pulls leeches off his tummy. The climax is his eventual encounter with the giant water bug, the “perfect killing machine.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monaghan is charming, but he's no David Attenborough. You wouldn't catch Sir David addressing a cobra with a “woo-hoo-hoo!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The point, mind you, is that the critters encountered are real and scary and killers. The critters on The Following are fiction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Oh, full of scorpions is my mind,” Macbeth says to his missus in Act Three. And “Indeed!” say we all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also airing Monday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Presidential Inauguration coverage begins at 11 a.m. on all the U.S. networks and news channels, and on the Canadian news channels too. Hours and hours of punditry, pageantry and a big speech. Not scary at all.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a private ceremony on Sunday, followed by a public observance today, Barack Obama will take an ancient oath of office and begin his second term. American civic life has few rituals, but a presidential inauguration is perhaps its most sacred: a hushed public pledge, a speech that reaches for rhetorical heights, a raucous parade, sparkling formal balls.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years ago, the inauguration of Mr. Obama, the first black president, was as much a moment of contemplation as of celebration. This inauguration, conducted amid an economic recession that still hasn't receded, is almost an afterthought. The great hopes for a president who seemed to possess political stardust – and who won a Nobel Peace Prize only eight months into his administration – have been replaced by hard, stubborn realities. The hope this time is that the second term will be better than the fraught first one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Four years ago, everybody was thrilled and excited and exuberant,” former vice-president Walter Mondale, himself an unsuccessful presidential candidate in 1984, said in an interview. “This time, going to the inauguration is kind of like a duty. But at events like this, the president rarely disappoints.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big moment, of course, is the inaugural address. It's the overture to every presidential term, reflecting the times in which it's delivered and the character of the chief executive who delivers it. Here's a viewers' guide to Mr. Obama's second inaugural address:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is this a speech of broad themes or small specifics?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Presidents sometimes use their inaugurals to set a tone – of determination, as Franklin Roosevelt did in 1933 (“nothing to fear but fear itself”), or optimism, as Ronald Reagan did in 1981 (“we can and will resolve the problems which now confront us”). They sometimes use them to set forth their vision of the country, as George W. Bush did in 2001 when he spoke of “civility, courage, compassion and character.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this is a time when there's scant agreement among Americans on the broad principles, red-toothed disagreement on important fundamentals, and the widespread view that this President shies away from specifics. So listen to see whether Mr. Obama singles out issues such as gun control in the wake of the school killings in Connecticut or budget cuts in anticipation of the new fight brewing on Capitol Hill. No word in an inaugural address is selected in haste, or wasted. Every syllable matters, and is parsed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does the president sow in the American conscience a thought that will not die?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Jefferson did in 1800 when he opened his address with the rhetoric of conciliation: “We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists.” John Kennedy produced multiple memorable lines (“now the trumpet summons us again,” and “here on earth God's work must truly be our own”) and one challenge that's so well known that merely posing the first two words (“ask not …”) seals the speech's place in posterity. On Inauguration Day, the president has the world's ears. He wants to produce something that stays there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What signals does the president send about his own administration and, inevitably, his own predicament?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best recent example comes from George H.W. Bush, who, in 1989, made a statement that's hauntingly appropriate for our own time: “We have more will than wallet.” Mr. Obama begins his second term with economic distress, with many unresolved issues overseas, and amid a sense that he hasn't fulfilled the great promise he brought to the White House. Listen for hints of how he sees his own role in the world, and in history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does the president set a vision for the future?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not a question about the level of social spending or whether the Pentagon should depend on nimble special forces or conventional land and sea armies. This is a question about what the country is going to be. And it's the most elusive of achievements in inaugural addresses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Clinton hit that mark in 1993 when he spoke of what he described as “a simple but powerful truth: We need each other, and we must care for one another.” So did his predecessor, the first George Bush, who said his goal was “to make kinder the face of the nation and gentler the face of the world.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But perhaps the best example comes from Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural, a poignant speech that sometimes sits in the shadow of Lincoln's second inaugural, perhaps the greatest American address ever. Here's how Lincoln ended that first speech:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a high bar to cross. Every president tries, including this one.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are avocados really good for me? I read about how they are nutritious and have good fats, but I always feel gassy after eating one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avocados are a very nutritious food (they're a fruit actually). It's true they're high in fat – 84 per cent of the calories (325) in an avocado come from fat (30 grams). But as you've read, avocados contain mainly “good” fat called monounsaturated fat (the same type of fat found in olive oil). In fact, two-thirds of the fat in an avocado comes from monounsaturated fat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A diet high in monounsaturated fat from avocados has been shown to lower LDL (bad) cholesterol and raise HDL (good) cholesterol. Monounsaturated fat can also help reduce inflammation in the body.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other reasons why avocados are good for you. They're packed with potassium and deliver lutein and zeaxanthin, two phytochemicals that guard against cataract and macular degeneration. Avocados are an excellent source of folate, a B vitamin that keeps the DNA of your cells in good repair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Half of an avocado provides one-quarter of a day's worth of folate (the recommended daily intake is 400 micrograms). And they also supply a little vitamin E to your diet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avocados are also an exceptional source of fibre, which can cause digestive problems for some people. One avocado has 13.5 grams of fibre – half a day's worth for women (and one-third of a day's worth for men)! But everyone tolerates foods differently. While some people feel gassy and bloated after eating an avocado, others don't experience digestive upset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You shouldn't have to eliminate avocados from your diet to solve your gas problem, however. Reduce your portion size from one whole avocado to one quarter or one-half to see if that helps. Here are a few suggestions to enjoy smaller portions of avocado and still benefit from their nutrition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Spread whole grain toast with ripe avocado instead of butter or margarine. Add black pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Add chopped avocado to black bean soup or tacos for garnish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Mix diced avocado with chopped red onion, tomatoes, cilantro and fresh lime juice to make a salsa to serve with grilled fish or chicken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Add slices of avocado to a sandwich instead of cheese.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Combine sliced avocado, sliced fennel, orange segments and fresh mint for a refreshing salad. Top with fresh chopped parsley and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zero Dark Thirty is about the underworld of America. Not everyone would like seeing the United States from this perspective. We would prefer to see this bright, shining world illumined by values such as freedom, equality and justice for all. Little League baseball. Apple pie. Church on Sunday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The film opens with a torture scene. What you see on the screen is very similar to the evil that survivors of torture have experienced in Argentina, Chile, Iran, Syria, the former Soviet Union, etc.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now torture is being sold to us in the free world as “enhanced interrogation techniques.” It is becoming almost impossible to maintain democratic freedoms and human rights when, sadly, some leaders and citizens in the West support the holes of oblivion that America has constructed in the world after 9/11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These “black sites” are outside the rule of law, outside the reach of justice and mercy. It is there that we attempt to justify the practice of torture as a means to protect “our way of life.” But doesn't our way of life include a respect for human rights even when the going gets tough?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Torture is not designed to get information; its purpose is to break the human soul, to intimidate, to control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When watching a film about the atrocities of Hitler, for example, or Pinochet, or the Khmer Rouge, it is easy for the average viewer in the West to say, “My God! How could those barbarians do that?” But in Zero Dark Thirty, we watch, knowing that this is happening in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is important to know this reality and face it, but any film that deals with torture needs to stick to the facts and avoid speculation and overdramatization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reading the extensive amount of material on how Osama bin Laden was found, one quickly realizes that not only did torture not help in his capture, but also, by providing false information, it hindered the process. This is the fact the film fails to convey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zero Dark Thirty forces us to witness the degradation of human beings – not only the tortured, but also the torturers become twisted; everyone involved, from both sides, is degraded in the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is an illusion that a society can rely on torture and remain civilized in the process. Evil does not come to us from another planet. It lives right here inside every one of us. Torture must be abolished so that we can reclaim ourselves as moral human beings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The film begins with the sounds of the suffering of 9/11 victims. And as it continues, it unfolds a terrible tragedy: that by taking the path of torture in fighting those who committed a terrible crime against us, we are becoming more and more like them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as we think we are defeating them, they are winning. Courage and goodness do not live in guns and instruments of torture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The “heroine” of the film is a young <span class="companylink">CIA</span> woman who has spent all of her adult life, 12 years, searching for bin Laden. For 12 years, she has done little else. She has no friends, no other interests. She is like America, a nation that has become defined for 12 years by the enemy, bin Laden. It is through her persistence, and with the aid of considerable technology, that he is finally killed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last scene of the film, the <span class="companylink">CIA</span> heroine boards a plane to depart from Afghanistan. One of the flight crew asks her, “Where do you want to go?” She doesn't answer. She can't answer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like America without a tangible enemy, like America without a positive vision, she doesn't know where to go. Or why.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is really no good argument against the jab: a responsible citizen should get the flu vaccine. Yet the rate for Canadian adults under the age of 65 is just 35 per cent. Among healthcare workers, it is 40 to 50 per cent. That isn't good enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fear of needles is simply no excuse. Nor is the idea that flu cannot happen to you because it never has in the past. Or that it won't harm you. Even if that were true, it can harm others. Every year, 4,000 Canadians, mostly seniors, die of seasonal influenza and another 20,000 people are hospitalized. As Rick Mercer noted in a recent rant, “Even if you are healthy enough to fight the flu, if you get it, chances are you could pass it on to someone who can't fight it. So roll up your sleeves. It's just a little prick. Don't be one, get one.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year's vaccine, which protects against three strains of influenza including the more virulent H3N2 and H1N1, is well matched to those in circulation, and will reduce the risk of infection by at least 50 per cent, according to a new study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An inoculation has the added benefit of protecting the vulnerable – seniors, children and those with suppressed immune systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why isn't the uptake greater?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It takes a long time to adopt preventive practices even if they make sense. We are always inventing reasons not to change our behaviour,” says Dr. Alison McGeer, director of infection control at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto. Parents readily vaccinate their children against meningitis, yet more children die from flu each year than meningitis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As if to drive home the point, this year's flu season arrived early and hit hard. The Fraser Health Authority in Vancouver has been forced to declare a health hazard, while Newfoundland is suffering through one of the worst outbreaks in recent years. Toronto Public Health has reported a spike in cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health officials caution that prevention includes frequent handwashing, telecommuting instead of going into the office if you have symptoms – and the vaccine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A British research paper studying its benefits concluded that if eight health-care workers employed in a chronic-care facility receive the shot, the life of one resident in the facility is saved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't too late. Flu season lasts until March. The vaccine, which is free, is still available in clinics, doctor's offices and even some pharmacies. Somewhere, somebody will thank you.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Liberal leadership truly is Justin Trudeau's to lose, his eight opponents appear disinclined to help him lose it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first all candidates' debate on Sunday evening, the Papineau MP delivered an assured performance that the others on the stage for the most part failed to challenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Montreal MP Marc Garneau and former Ontario MP Martha Hall Findlay also did well, giving the strong impression that this contest involves these three plus six also-runnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But nothing that happened in Vancouver Sunday night shook the strong probability that Justin Trudeau will be the next Liberal leader. The debate was virtually devoid of policy substance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone who arrived looking for fresh ideas on trade, the environment, poverty or native concerns heard a great deal of empathy and calls for action, but very little in the way of what those actions should be, other than to listen and consult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the partisan front, the most direct challenge came from B.C. MP Joyce Murray, the only candidate who advocates co-operating with other parties to help defeat the Conservatives in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Trudeau, who opposes the idea, insisted that “it's not enough to just replace Stephen Harper with somebody else” unless that somebody had a “very, very clear vision of where we're going forward.” Ms. Murray retorted “if you want to replace Stephen Harper, where's your plan?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His plan, Mr. Trudeau responded, involved “reaching out to people across the country.” Which means whatever it means.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apart from Ms. Murray – who has shown no evidence of emerging as a force in his campaign – all of the candidates made it clear there is absolutely no hope that Liberals and New Democrats will co-operate to defeat Mr. Harper in the next election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Where did your confidence go?” Ms. Hall Findlay asked Liberals who want to talk merger. “I'm not NDP. I'm a proud Liberal.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who hope progressive forces will combine to defeat the Conservatives in the 2015 election should shelve those hopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. Trudeau did join with Mr. Garneau in promising that a Liberal government would replace Canada's first-past-the-post system of electing MPs with a preferential ballot, in which voters rank the parties, with the second choices of those who place last allocated until one candidate achieved a majority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conservatives can be expected to leap on this proposal, warning that if they are relegated to a minority government in the next election, the NDP and the Liberals will combine to defeat them, form a coalition, and then change the electoral system to their advantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deborah Coyne, one of the six marginal candidates in the race, appeared to confirm just that. While ruling out co-operation with other parties before the election, she said, “after an election it's a different ball game.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Garneau also took a shot across the Trudeau bow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision on choosing the next leader, he warned, is “the most crucial we've ever faced … the Liberal Party needs a strong leader. Leadership is the product of your life experience.” But these were gentle jabs, and unlikely to dim the aura of inevitability that encircles Mr. Trudeau. A single debate is just that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are four more to come, before the April leadership vote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But any candidate who wants to challenge Mr. Trudeau's hegemonic lead needs to disrupt his image of unstoppability by more openly challenging his lack of experience and his vague commitments to “honest, open, strong conversations” that are devoid of content.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The eight can, of course, avoid such tactics in the interest of party unity and in hopes of gaining Mr. Trudeau's favour after he wins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then why did they run in the first place?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You've resolved to do all the right things to stay fit and healthy in 2013 – but that can be challenging when scientists keep changing their minds about what “right” is. Here are five topics to keep an eye on in the coming year, where scientists will be presenting new evidence that will help keep us on the right track.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The obesity paradox</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, few people questioned whether being overweight is bad for you. But lately, critics have argued that carrying a few “extra” pounds carries no health penalty, and in fact might help you live longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT WE KNOW The relationship between weight and mortality follows a U-shaped curve: Those at the extreme low and high ends are at the highest risk. But it's not clear where the lowest point on the curve is, or how steeply it rises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT WE'LL LEARN Sorting out the confounding role of factors like smoking and serious illness – which first make you lose weight and later make you die – is a top priority for epidemiologists. More generally, the chicken-and-egg debate about whether fitness or fatness is a better predictor of health will continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barefoot running</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Running in wispy “minimalist” shoes – or no shoes at all – has made a rapid passage from fringe curiosity to mainstream activity. Now research studies that were launched in 2009 and 2010, when the movement took off, are finally producing results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT WE KNOW When you take your shoes off, you change the way you run, taking shorter strides and absorbing more force with your ankles instead of knees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT WE'LL LEARN The burning question is whether these changes reduce your risk of injury. There are reasons to think this should be true, but proper randomized studies take time – which is why we'll finally start accumulating meaningful data this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supplements vs. foods</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One ironclad certainty is that you will read a bewildering stream of news, often contradictory, about supplements that may or may not change your life in untold ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT WE KNOW Foods contain literally thousands of chemicals and components that combine to keep us alive and healthy. So far, extracting a single element from healthy foods and putting it in a pill has failed to match the benefits of those foods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT WE'LL LEARN Researchers are beginning to focus on the broader context of dietary patterns, stepping back to understand healthy eating as a whole that's greater than the sum of its micronutrient parts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pollution and exercise</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every summer, city dwellers have to choose whether – and where – to exercise when air quality takes a nosedive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT WE KNOW Inhaling particulates emitted by cars and trucks spurs inflammation that spreads throughout the body. Exercise, on the other hand, helps your body fight inflammation. But which effect wins?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT WE'LL LEARN Don't expect a black-and-white final answer: Any urban exercise inevitably involves trade-offs that will vary on an individual basis. But expect more guidance from forthcoming studies on how much you can exercise, and at what pollution levels, before the negatives outweigh the positives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overdosing on recovery</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Athletes have access to an endless array of sophisticated recovery aids, from “cryosaunas” to compression machines. But experts are now wondering if it might be too much of a good thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT WE KNOW Post-workout aids like ice baths and anti-inflammatories can help limit muscle damage and accelerate repair after intense workouts. But in doing so, they may suppress the signals that tell an athlete's body to adapt and get stronger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT WE'LL LEARN It's a simple question of whether the benefits of quicker recovery outweigh the downside of reduced adaptation. The only way to find out is to run experiments, which is what researchers are doing now.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicole Ryan was a battered woman par excellence. As the 37-year-old schoolteacher from Nova Scotia saw it, she had no escape. And the justice system, too, seemed to have no way out in her case. Either her attempt at hiring a hit man to kill her husband could be justified or it could not be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Supreme Court found a just way out for Ms. Ryan and for the justice system. It is not always appreciated that the court's first obligation is to settle the immediate dispute before them. Ms. Ryan faced a horrible series of injustices, but the hiring of a hit man should be beyond the pale. The court found a way last Friday to free Ms. Ryan from the justice system's claws, while stopping short of making a case for hit men.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ryan's story should raise the hair on the backs of Canadians' necks. Her husband, Michael Ryan, a 230-pound ex-soldier, held a gun to her head at least four times; he threatened their daughter; and he killed the family dog. Yet her many pleas for help from the RCMP were not heard, according to the trial judge in her case. And somehow that same RCMP went so far as to conduct a sting operation on her – the “hit man” was an undercover agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was acquitted in Nova Scotia, and the province's highest court ruled that she acted under duress. The <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span> said, however, that duress applies only when forced to harm someone else to save oneself. But what to do about Ms. Ryan, and the precedent?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The court (with the exception of Mr. Justice Morris Fish) said that, after a five-year legal process, enough was enough. It would be unfair to put Ms. Ryan, who had suffered greatly, through any more. The defence of duress had been unclear, it said, and the Crown had changed its position on that defence between the trial and the appeal, compromising her defence if a new trial were to be held.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would have been madness to continue to prosecute Ms. Ryan. She's no danger to anyone. It would also have been wrong to create a precedent in favour of hit men as a solution to violence. The overriding message in the case should be that police need to do a proper investigation when they receive complaints of spousal violence.</p>

One of the things he attributes his success to is his “interesting people” meetings – biweekly dates with accomplished and intelligent individuals who work outside of the movie and television industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These meetings have led both directly and indirectly to many successful projects (Grazer came up with the idea for Liar Liar after meeting with a trial lawyer). “I do everything I can to disrupt my comfort zone,” he said in a 2007 interview with The New York Times, so much so that he actually has a staff member who sources stimulating personalities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Science is on his side: When we spend time with people who have different careers/backgrounds/viewpoints from our own, our brains are forced to switch off autopilot and our typical thought patterns are disrupted. In this cerebral shakeup, seemingly disconnected thoughts coalesce and produce the proverbial lightbulb-over-your-head moment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So if a CEO is trying to solve a complex management problem, she might be better off chatting with the aspiring indie rocker who delivers her mail … wait, do I smell a Jamie Lee Curtis/Zac Efron vehicle?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I tend to spend most of my time with colleagues and people I have known since I wore braces. In search of breaking the comfort cycle and bringing on the eureka, I decided to pencil in an interesting person meeting of my own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walk a mile in another man's art collection</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Smart is my friend Greg's dad – someone I have met at the odd Christmas party and bumped into at the <span class="companylink">Art Gallery of Ontario</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smart worked for 30 years as a family and aboriginal affairs lawyer at <span class="companylink">Osler Hoskin &amp; Harcourt</span> law firm in Toronto. During that time he took on the responsibility of overseeing his firm's art collection, which is now one of the most revered corporate collections of contemporary Canadian art in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He retired from law eight years ago and since then has started a second career as an art consultant, curator and, perhaps most notably, enthusiast. (When I say he's enthusiastic about contemporary Canadian art, I mean it in the way that Cookie Monster is enthusiastic about Chips Ahoy! cookies.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I chose him as my interesting person because Bill Clinton wasn't returning my calls and also because visual art has never been my thing. I can talk movies, fashion, books, music, design and royal baby bumps, but my understanding and appreciation of visual art has never evolved past “that does/doesn't look good on your wall.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before we embarked on our lunch date, Smart suggested we take a quick tour of the Osler collection, most of which isn't easy on the eyes in the traditional sense: the menacing bunny rabbits by John Scott (“the man responsible for injecting grit into the Toronto art scene,” I learned); the eerie sculptures by Evan Penny (“probably the most important sculptor Canada has produced”); the freshly relevant work of Robert Houle (the man who pushed native art past totem poles). One of my private tour guide's favourite pieces was a series of white canvases, arranged to resemble a wave or a jazz riff. He called it minimalist. I didn't get it, but I was beginning to appreciate his appreciation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The art of understanding</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over lunch I asked what kind of advice Smart gives young collectors and we discussed what he views as the misguided notion that you should just buy what you like, as opposed to buying what is good. “But isn't good subjective?” I asked. It is, he said, but if we never challenged what we liked, the world would be decorated in painted fruit bowls and flower vases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My somewhat simplified takeaway is that taste in art is something that evolves with understanding and exposure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our conversation wasn't totally one-sided – I talked about the challenges of my own work and suggested that a <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> feed might be a good way for Smart to spread the word about shows and artists he wants to highlight, of which there are many. “We really are in the golden age of Canadian art,” he said as we finished off the last of the pinot noir.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reflecting on the afternoon, I was reminded of a quote from Susan Orlean, the magazine writer whose brilliant article about an orchid thief was turned into one of my favourite movies, Adaptation. “I suppose I do have one embarrassing passion,” writes Orlean, contemplating the obsession that her subject feels for orchids. “I want to know what it feels like to care about something passionately.” This is not to say I don't have my own passions, but spending time immersed in someone else's was inspiring and fun and, yes, interesting. I felt engaged and creatively charged, and maybe even a little closer to eureka.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He entered the Ontario Liberal leadership campaign at almost the last possible moment, a candidate plagued by subpar communications skills and a spotty ethics record. Today, he's running a surprisingly strong fourth – good enough to give him a chance to crown the province's next premier, even if he still has little chance of winning that job himself.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To listen to his critics, Harinder Takhar is an imposter and a menace. The prospect of him parlaying the 13 per cent of elected delegates he will bring to next weekend's convention into a powerful government position is, by the account of a recent Toronto Star column that had some Liberal heads nodding, one that should cause Ontarians considerable alarm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To listen to Mr. Takhar, he's an inspiration. “I see myself as a trailblazer in the South Asian community,” he said in an interview last week. His candidacy, he predicted, will “open up doors for all communities – it doesn't matter their colour, where they come from, where they were born.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Mr. Takhar really is, when you get past the overheated rhetoric, is a savvy guy who has cleverly worked within – and in the process exposed – a leadership-selection process that has encouraged precisely the sort of old-school “ethnic politics” some Liberals are now purporting to disdain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He does not deny that he has pulled most of his support from a small number of immigrant communities. But that doesn't entirely set him apart from the rest of the leadership field.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Charles Sousa went to his community and got votes,” Mr. Takhar said in the interview, referring to the fifth-place candidate's focus on fellow Portuguese-Canadians. “He's not being targeted because he's not the same colour I am.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no questioning the first part of that statement, at least. And while front-runners Sandra Pupatello and Kathleen Wynne have tried harder to make broad appeals, they too have disproportionately drawn support from relatively narrow demographics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Everybody has been targeting the South Asian community,” Mr. Takhar said. And while he allowed that “I belong to that community, so naturally I will get a little more support than everybody else,” he noted that others will also draw from wherever they naturally have an advantage, including Ms. Pupatello from Italian-Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that all seems trapped somewhere last century, the antithesis of ambitious outreach attempted during the federal Liberals' concurrent leadership campaign, the fact is that provincial candidates would have been daft not to play it old school in this campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Premier Dalton McGuinty announced his resignation in October, the Liberals gave prospective candidates less than a month to sign up new members eligible to elect delegates to the convention. When organizers have extremely narrow windows to build support bases, especially for candidates running for unpopular parties in unengaged provinces, they go where many new members can be signed up at once – churches, temples, community associations – rather than focusing on individuals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Takhar was more explicit about it than most, boasting that he only put resources toward delegate contests in the roughly half of ridings where he thought he was competitive, which naturally skewed along demographic lines. And if he is to be believed, he will only spend about $100,000 during the campaign, one-fifth of the limit. Yet he will enter the convention carrying more weight than not just Mr. Sousa but also Eric Hoskins, a seemingly attractive candidate who relied more upon persuasion than community ties, and has 6 per cent of elected delegates to show for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What exactly Mr. Takhar's candidacy has achieved is another matter. For all his talk of barrier-breaking, his main contribution – and it's a significant one – has been to put forward a fiscal agenda far more detailed than that of any other candidate. More materially, he may assure himself a prominent role in the next cabinet by playing queen-maker. (Some Liberals perceive him to have been a stalking horse for Ms. Pupatello all along.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, he has attracted all sorts of unwanted attention. Some of it, including a dispute about just how poor he was when he came to Canada that hardly stands out in the history of politicians exaggerating humble roots, is pretty marginal. Much more significant is his inability to explain away the provincial integrity commissioner's 2006 ruling that, while in cabinet, he failed to maintain a suitably arms-length relationship with a business placed in a blind trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that question mark is not new, and Mr. Takhar has been able to run a relatively successful campaign in spite of it. For anyone who has a problem with that, the issue should be more with the process than the candidate.</p>

He courteously asked that she “should somehow respect our process in terms of the <span class="companylink">Assembly of First Nations</span>” and let the chiefs' executive continue their work; her protest has become “a concern.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief Spence has certainly made her point. Her subsistence on fish broth and tea for more than 40 days is well known across Canada. Her reasoning, however, is faulty. She insists on meeting with both David Johnston, the Governor-General, and Prime Minister Stephen Harper on the ground that Mr. Johnston represents the Crown and that, “when the treaty was signed, it was with the Crown.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The treaty is indeed still with the Crown, but that does not require Mr. Johnston's presence at meetings about the right way to implement that particular agreement, Treaty 9. It was signed decades after Confederation, in 1906, not with the governor-general or the prime minister of the day, or with the federal cabinet, but rather with civil servants (one of them was the poet Duncan Campbell Scott). Attawapiskat did not adhere to the treaty until later, in 1930; again, the Cree chiefs dealt with civil servants. The federal government is the Crown in right of Canada and the cabinet is the Governor-General-in-Council. Today, the <span class="companylink">Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development</span> continues to be part of the federal Crown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief Augustine's point was essentially that Chief Spence's hunger strike and her presence on Victoria Island in the Ottawa have become a distraction. There is no good reason for her to complain that the meeting earlier this month was called a working group. First-nations chiefs, on the one hand, and elected Canadian politicians and unelected civil servants, on the other, need to work with each other in good faith, and dramatic gestures should not be prolonged.</p>

In practice, things are more complicated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institutional structures of aboriginal governance were created for a population that was largely rural. For instance, the leader of the AFN is elected by reserve-based chiefs across the country. But many native people don't live on reserves. Indeed, a majority of Canada's aboriginal people live in urban areas. (Just how large a majority will soon be revealed in the 2011 census figures.) As the country now gives new consideration to aboriginal issues – Chief Theresa Spence's hunger strike, the Idle No More movement, the Supreme Court decision on the Métis – it is important to consider whether the realities and concerns of urban aboriginal people are being adequately represented.</p>

To help remedy this gap, the Environics Institute for Survey Research conducted the first major study of urban aboriginal people in Canada, which was released in 2010. The purpose of the Urban Aboriginal Peoples Study (UAPS) was to understand and systematically document the lives and experiences of these individuals – their identity, values and aspirations. The cornerstone of the study was an in-depth, face-to-face survey of 2,614 Indian, Métis and Inuit people living in 11 Canadian cities. (Most of the interviewers were aboriginals themselves.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among many other questions, the survey asked: “Thinking about both aboriginal political organizations and Canadian political parties, is there one that you feel best represents you?” Twenty-seven per cent named one of the national aboriginal organizations, including the AFN (13 per cent), the <span class="companylink">Métis National Council</span> (10 per cent) and the <span class="companylink">Native Women's Association of Canada</span> (2 per cent). Roughly the same number (26 per cent) said one of the national political parties best represented them. And about the same proportion again (27 per cent) said that no party or organization represented them. In short, there is no one organization that seems to speak on behalf of the urban aboriginal population of Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(The problem of representing large groups of people in political processes is, of course, by no means limited to aboriginal peoples. Canadians agonize endlessly about the legitimacy of minority governments, the fairness of party nomination processes and so on.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How are aboriginal people faring in our cities? The UAPS revealed some significant and even surprising insights:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked what they most want to achieve in their lives, urban aboriginal people cited the same kinds of aspirations that other Canadians might name: completing their education (28 per cent), caring for their families (24 per cent), achieving career or job satisfaction (22 per cent) and home ownership (19 per cent). Eleven per cent said they want to travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most aboriginal people living in cities (71 per cent) consider their city “home,” not simply a transitional place to get a job or go to school. And two-thirds (65 per cent) say they like living in the city “a lot.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, most (58 per cent) describe themselves as very happy; an additional 36 per cent are somewhat happy. Among those who report high job satisfaction, 80 per cent are very happy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, most (70 per cent) report having been personally discriminated against because of their aboriginal identity, and 89 per cent believe that non-aboriginal people have a generally negative impression of aboriginal people. In spite of this, 88 per cent say they are very or somewhat proud to be Canadian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If these lives – shaped by discrimination, but also characterized by happiness, striving and a vision of the good life that is shared by Canadians of many backgrounds – sound unfamiliar to non-aboriginal Canadians, we might ask ourselves why.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We believe that the conversation about aboriginal issues in Canada can only advance meaningfully if contemporary, urban realities are considered alongside the legacy of colonialism and the urgent challenges facing many reserves and rural communities. Aboriginal people living in cities share a history with their families and friends on reserve – and may care deeply about questions like resource-revenue sharing – but their daily realities are distinct and their identities and aspirations must also inform the conversation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was once conventional wisdom that aboriginal people living in cities were just passing through – pursuing temporary work or fleeing problems on reserves, their “real” homes. UAPS refutes both of those ideas: For most urban aboriginal people, the city is their “real” home, and they have come there not as refugees but, like so many other Canadian urbanites, as individuals in search of rewarding educational and economic opportunities, as well as the other benefits of city life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These urban residents may be supportive of the objectives of their aboriginal brothers and sisters in rural and on-reserve settings, but other forms of justice may interest them just as much, such as being free of discrimination as they pursue opportunities in urban, multicultural Canada. To say that many aboriginal people make up part of the mosaic of our cities is not to deny their special status as first peoples or to gloss over their unique experiences resulting from colonialism. But to ignore the fact that more than half a million aboriginal people live in cities – and that for these people, justice, equity and recognition may take different forms – is to miss a big part of the picture.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is nearly to impossible to close an underused school, library or fire hall in Toronto. No matter how much money it will save or how much sense it makes, politics and neighbourhood pressure always get in the way.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider the case of fire hall 424. The picturesque 1928 building at 462 Runnymede Road in the city's west end has been targeted for closing for more than a quarter century. Again and again, it has dodged fate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's 1987 Fire Master Plan noted that the service area for 424 overlapped with that of a nearby station at 83 Deforest Road. It recommended closing both and building a new station at a different location. Nothing happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report by KPMG consultants in 1999 said that, because the city had failed to find an appropriate place to build a new fire station, the fire service should simply close station 424. Nothing happened. In 2007, yet another master plan recommended closing 424, considering how near it is to other fire stations and how little response times would be affected. The station lived on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this week's budget negotiations, 424 was once again on the chopping block. Under pressure from Mayor Rob Ford to flatline his budget, fire chief Jim Sales recommended closing the station. But the firefighters union and the local city councillor, Sarah Doucette, fought back. In a last-minute deal to get the budget passed, city council added about $3-million to the fire-service allotment. The extra money allows the service to fund 63 firefighting positions and keep five fire trucks on the road, at least until an efficiency review comes in this summer. It also saves 424 yet again. This little fire station has more lives than a cat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Doucette, who led a rally and organized a petition to save 424, calls it a victory for a changing community that is getting more high-rise buildings and may need better fire service in the future. “I appreciate past reports, but we have to look at now and the future. What will my ward need five years, seven years out? That's why I'm so passionate about this. Closing is final, done, gone.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a time of tight government budgets and limited economic growth, the city has to make the best possible use of its resources. Keeping a redundant fire station open year after year on the basis of sentiment and community protest is hardly the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three other fire halls lie within a few blocks of 424, which sits in a mainly residential, low-rise neighbourhood. The station gets around 1,300 calls a year, or between three and four calls a day. On the day I visited last week, the four firefighters on 24-hour shift had responded to calls about a fire on the subway tracks, an elderly woman who fell in her apartment and broke her hip and a backhoe that punched through a gas main.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">District chief Stephan Powell argues that in a job where seconds make a difference, “I don't think anyone wants to gamble on somebody's life. I don't want to be the actuary who says ‘Let's just yank this hall,' and somebody dies.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that isn't reason enough to keep the hall going, he says, the local community is devoted to it. One resident started a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page to save it. A local artist displayed a painting of it. “This tends to be a walking neighbourhood,” he says. “People will visit their local fire hall, frequent the library, frequent the parks.” Generations of schoolchildren have come to 424 to learn about firefighting. Only the other day, says veteran firefighter Dwayne Verhey, a woman locked out of her house in the rain with her children came by asking for help. They went and picked her lock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was a nice thing to do, and fire hall 424 is a lovely old place, with its antique bell and classic fire pole. But you have to wonder whether it is reasonable to keep the station open against repeated recommendations to the contrary even from the fire service itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It happens again and again with city buildings. A core service review recommended closing a handful of underused libraries in 2011. City council balked. Consultants and studies have repeatedly called for closing schools left half full by declining enrolment. School-board trustees repeatedly push back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such stubborn devotion to bricks and mortar makes it hard to deliver services in the efficient way the city should.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A syrupy, slow-motion video of star-struck young flag carriers tying their skates in the <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span> before leading the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> team out onto the ice. The crowd chanting “Alfie! Alfie! Alfie!” (for Sens captain Daniel Alfredsson) even before the national anthem. Chris Neil on the scoreboard offering a heartfelt “We missed you guys” to the fans. A spitting-image twin of Sens head coach Paul MacLean – walrus mustache included – seated directly behind the Ottawa bench. Double-lung transplant Hélène Campbell to drop the puck. And, of course, a full house willing to forgive and forget and cash in on the 50-per-cent souvenir discount, $1 popcorn and the much-appreciated gesture by sponsor <span class="companylink">Molson Coors Brewing Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During long stretches, however, it looked like the beer-sampling promotion had taken place pregame in the dressing rooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, the Senators prevailed over the visiting <span class="companylink">Florida Panthers</span> 4-0, but it was hardly a game exhibiting that promised passion and every-game-counts import the experts had predicted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To call the opening period “sloppy” would be polite. A conflation of some players bringing four months of shinny to the rink, some players bringing a month or so of European hockey, some coming from Russia, from the minors, from junior, coaches not sure if it is “O's and X's” or “X's and O's” – and you have your mid-January opener.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Missed passes, dumb penalties, bad ideas, missed shots, endless icings, goaltenders lost beyond their creases and lines desperately in need of shuffling. … Welcome to the start of the 2013 season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is circumstance like this that can produce a situation where, through their first two games, perhaps the best <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span> player has been 22-year-old defenceman Patrick Wiercioch, who wasn't good enough to make the team in previous years and has been playing in the minors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was Wiercioch who impressed last Saturday, as Ottawa spoiled the <span class="companylink">Winnipeg Jets</span>' home opener with a 4-1 come-from-behind victory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it was Wiercioch who, halfway through a stumbling first period Monday, saw close friend Kyle Turris (both hail from B.C.'s Lower Mainland) parked off to the left side of the Florida net and sent a perfect cross-ice pass Turris one-timed behind goaltender Jose Theodore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turris scored again nearly eight minutes into the second period, when he tipped a perfect lead pass by Guillaume Latendresse high behind Theodore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loss was not entirely Theodore's to eat. He managed a terrific save off an Erik Karlsson breakaway on a bad Florida turnover late in the third period, and another when Alfredsson sent André Benoit in alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the final minutes were not kind to Theodore, as first Ottawa forward Jim O'Brien clipped in a goal on a broken play and then rookie Jakob Silfverberg scored his first <span class="companylink">NHL</span> goal on a shot Theodore should have had.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Panthers were so listless that, halfway through the game, they had barely counted 10 shots on Ottawa goaltender Craig Anderson. Anderson was superb against Winnipeg; didn't have to be against the Panthers; but he still impressed when forced to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anderson's best moments came in the third period, when his teammates appeared to think the new CBA had mandated 40-minute games. MacLean had said he was nervous before the game; despite the victory, he was likely just as nervous after.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sellout crowd of 19,952– eerily quiet at times – took delight in booing Alexei Kovalev, who spent two years with the Senators before leaving for the Russian leagues and is now on a one-year deal with Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kovalev was paid $10-million to play in Ottawa and delivered about 10 cents worth of effort – though no one ever denied the ability was there if he cared to show if off outside practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kovalev came into the game the Panthers leading scorer, with a goal and two assists in Florida's 5-1 victory over the <span class="companylink">Carolina Hurricanes</span> in their home opener last Saturday in Sunrise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He might have added to that total had his linemates been able to finish a couple of very good setups in the second period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Ottawa victory had been hoped for as much by the players as the fans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We can show some appreciation with a strong effort,” MacLean had said before the game. He got that, even if it was not exactly a riveting contest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We want to give them a reason to keep coming back,” Senators long-time defenceman Chris Phillips added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They'll come back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hopefully, so, too, will the skill and intensity level.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Buffalo Sabres</span> ought to be scrutinized like any other team in what is clearly still the jury-rigged portion of this odd NHL season. But this much appears clear through two games and two wins: Cody Hodgson seems to have found a home.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hodgson collected his second goal of the season in Monday's 2-1 win over the <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span> at the Air Canada Centre, the beneficiary of being in the right place as Christian Ehrhoff unloaded from the point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sabres are now 13-5-3 with Hodgson in the lineup since the 10th pick in the 2008 draft joined the Sabres from the <span class="companylink">Vancouver Canucks</span> on Feb. 27, 2012, in exchange for Zack Kassian and Marc-André Gragnani – and he's no passenger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hodgson centres the Sabres first line, between Thomas Vanek and Jason Pominville, and is plus-four through the first two games of the season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It speaks volumes that Vanek made clear to head coach Lindy Ruff and his staff, and publicly, that he wanted Hodgson as his centre after enjoying an 11-game run together in 2012. And it must be said Hodgson helped his own cause during the recent player lockout: working out with Gary Roberts's group and playing 19 games with the Sabres' Rochester affiliate in the AHL (four goals, 15 assists).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Given the state of the Canucks' forward depth, you wonder whether Vancouver general manager Mike Gillis might like a do-over.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until Nazem Kadri scored on the power play with 1 minute 42 seconds left in regulation, the Sabres first line provided what little there was in the way of hockey in the Leafs' season opener.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vanek set up Pominville for the Sabres' second goal at 4:51 of the second, deftly picking Nikolai Kulemin's pocket in the Leafs end, and it was all muck and mire from that point on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Leafs had all sorts of puck possession, staking their claim when the Sabres took three minor penalties in a span of 1:37 in the first period but, barring Dion Phaneuf's hit crossbar, there wasn't much accomplished. The heroes of last Saturday's 2-1 win over the <span class="companylink">Montreal Canadiens</span> – Kadri, Mike Kostka and Leo Komarov – were non-factors until the end of the game (Kostka picked up an assist), finding rhythm hard to come by in part because of the number of special-teams opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's early, far too early, to get a read on the post-lockout temperature of Maple Leafs fans. But know this: Even by the low standards for atmosphere that is the norm for Leafs games, Monday's opener was sleepy until Kadri set the Air Canada Centre on fire with goaltender Ben Scrivens on the bench, then missed an open net with time running out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Leafs' opening ceremony owed a little to the opening of the 2012 London Olympics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield “dropping” the puck from the International Space Station, it started a relay that included Felix Potvin, Darcy Tucker, Darryl Sittler and, ultimately, Johnny Bower. Pretty much what you'd expect when you have an extra three months to plan due to the lockout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Full credit to the organization: It struck an appropriate tone in the days leading up to the home opener. It gave away tickets. (Free hockey? Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd.?)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So hockey took it's first tentative step back in Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't much for 58 minutes, but in a 48-game schedule there will be few points for artistic merit. Just a bunch of guys and a bunch of teams trying to find a middle ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of them will also find a home, in the process, much like Hodgson seems to have done.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is at an age now – 42 – where the youngest members of the <span class="companylink">Anaheim Ducks</span> could be his sons. Cam Fowler celebrated his first birthday the same year Teemu Selanne shattered Mike Bossy's <span class="companylink">NHL</span> rookie goal-scoring record.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twelve months after Devante Smith-Pelly was born, Selanne accepted the Calder Trophy after scoring 76 goals in his first <span class="companylink">NHL</span> season, a record that will likely never be broken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowadays, Selanne is going into the record books for his work as an <span class="companylink">NHL</span> senior citizen. So on Saturday, for example, in the Ducks' season opener, Selanne produced a mere four points. That made him the oldest player to score four points in a game since Gordie Howe did it against the <span class="companylink">Buffalo Sabres</span> in 1971. You know you're getting on in years when the Howe comparisons start. Howe made it into his 50s before he retired and Selanne wants no part of that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he is defying all the stereotypes in what is supposed to be primarily a young man's game. In fact, that was supposedly one of the givens of a shortened 48-game <span class="companylink">NHL</span> season – how young legs would rule. Then Selanne and Jaromir Jagr scored four points apiece on opening night and it made you forget all the givens and think: Okay, let's see what else the old-timers can bring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's funny but I think I enjoy this more than when I was 22,” Selanne said Monday as the Ducks prepared to take on the <span class="companylink">Calgary Flames</span>. “When you get older, you start to appreciate things. You know it's near the end of the road, so you try to enjoy everything. When you're 22, you think there's a thousand games ahead and there's a long way to go. So far, this has been awesome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm proud I'm able to play against these young guys, at this age, but after all, I guess they're just numbers. If you look after yourself and you still have a lot of passion for the game, good things happen. It's fun.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Selanne was known throughout his career as the Finnish Flash and it was his skating that set him apart. His knees were acting up and in 2003-04, he had his worst year ever – 32 points in 78 games. Things didn't look good. But then the 2004-05 lockout came along and allowed him a chance to heal. He was his old self again right away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers blur when it comes to Selanne and records but consider this: From the start of 2005-06, or just after he turned 35, Selanne has averaged almost a point a game (455 in 463) – extraordinary numbers by any standard, unprecedented when you consider the age at which he's produced them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Selanne will acknowledge he had “almost lost the passion for hockey” when he was dealing with his knee issues in the mid-2000s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I came back and felt healthy again, it was an unbelievable feeling. At that point, I said, ‘Every day when I can come and be healthy and play this game that I love, I'm going to be thankful for that.'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Selanne's longevity is all the more surprising considering he originally planned to play just a handful of years in North America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He made a bet to that effect with his former <span class="companylink">Winnipeg Jets</span> teammates Freddie Olausson and Thomas Steen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Lucky they don't remember that,” Selanne said with a laugh. “But at that time, if somebody had told me when I was 22 that I would still be in the league when I'm 42, I would call the doctor for sure for this guy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My first year, it was an unbelievable year, but in that time, 30 for a hockey player was old. It was totally different. I remember when guys were talking about guys who were 30, they'd say, ‘Yeah, he might have a year or two left.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Well, it's a different story now.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Selanne is one of a handful of <span class="companylink">NHL</span> players who've previously played a shortened 48-game season, in 1994-95. Jagr won the scoring title that year, while Selanne was 19th with 48 points in 45 games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was a little bit different,” Selanne said. “I felt it was quite easy last time. I played in Finland. I was in top shape when the league started. Not so many guys did that. I don't think, that time, so many players were prepared. Now everybody's ready to go right away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But I remember the schedule was very tough, that time too. We played against our conference teams only. It makes every game more special. These points – every point is so critical right now. You always try to remind yourself and your teammates, one point, or two points somewhere that we lose because we just do something stupid early, that might be the points that make a difference. There are no nights off.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ducks head coach Bruce Boudreau, who believes Selanne might be the best athlete in the world for his age, wants to make sure he gets his rest, which is hard to do in a shortened season – harder still, considering Selanne never wants to take a day off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My body feels better when I do a little skating every day,” he said. “But with this schedule, you have to force yourself to take more days off and rest. You have to do all the things right and be very disciplined off the ice.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than anything, Selanne wants to be part of a Ducks playoff team again this year. Anaheim finished 13th overall in the Western Conference last season, thanks to a dismal first half that cost Randy Carlyle his job as coach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I look around this dressing room, I don't see any reason why we can't have success in here,” Selanne said. “It starts from every individual.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Night in and night out, you have to find a way to play your best – even the tough nights. Everybody is playing well when they have their best night, but when you don't have your best night, and you still find a way to win, that's what you need and that's our goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The way we played the second half last season, that's the hockey we want to play this year.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marlene Giersdorf is furious. The 30-year-old single mother had her employment insurance benefits cut off because of harsh new regulations that came into effect this year. Now she is staging a one-woman protest outside the federal employment office in Montague, PEI. She has a homemade sign that says, “YOU are next.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Giersdorf is a test case for the new EI rules, which are more aggressive about getting frequent users back to work. Some claimants will now be obliged to apply for jobs that may pay only 70 or 80 per cent of what they made before and to commute as far as an hour to work. Ms. Giersdorf, who has a nine-year-old son, was cut off because she refused to look for work in Charlottetown, which is a 35-minute drive or so from Montague.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here in Toronto, where a 35-minute commute is just a warm-up, I suspect Ms. Giersdorf's plight wouldn't draw a lot of sympathy. She's been on EI a few times before – when she “needed a break,” she told the National Post. Employment opportunities in Montague (population: 5,134) are limited at the best of times. She says she quit her previous job because of “stress” (she worked a 60-hour week on the night shift at a nursing home). She insists she can't work in Charlottetown because she doesn't own a car and can't afford to buy one. “Are they going to pay my taxi fare?” she wailed. (Actually, there's a $10 shuttle bus. That hasn't come up.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in PEI, where employment insurance is embedded in the way of life, a lot of people are on her side. “How many others could end up having to fight for their benefits?” editorialized Charlottetown's The Guardian newspaper. It worries that the tougher rules will force people to work for less money, take jobs for which they're not suited and sometimes travel long distances to work. To which the more callous among us are likely to respond: So what?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employment insurance is supposed to be a short-term cushion for when times are tough or the labour market changes. But in Canada it has become a giant transfer of funds from high-employment regions to those where seasonal employment is common. Newfoundland and Labrador, PEI and New Brunswick are the biggest per-capita users of EI. “We have too many people who only entered the labour market to get EI benefits,” Bernard Valcourt, a federal cabinet minister from New Brunswick, told the Post. “It's become a way of life.” In Prince Edward Island, where the total population is a quarter that of Scarborough's, 26 per cent of the work force collects EI for part of every year, and EI benefits account for 9 per cent of labour income. (The national figure is 2.4 per cent.) People can qualify for 23 weeks of benefits with just 12 weeks of work – far more generous provisions than in Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, employers can't find skilled help because the math and literacy skills of roughly 40 per cent of the population are below high-school graduate level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worst part of EI is that it traps people and discourages them from moving to areas where their futures (and their kids' futures) might be better. As Janice MacKinnon, who was a finance minister in Saskatchewan's NDP government, wrote, the system “rests on the assumption that it is in the best interests of individuals and the economy or unemployed Canadians to remain within their region, hoping jobs will come to them.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Giersdorf has done pretty well by the system, but now that the rules have tightened up a bit, she feels betrayed. “I paid EI benefits with every job I worked and now I can't get any help,” she sobbed to The Guardian. But more EI isn't what she needs. What she needs is to get out of the dependency trap.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I recently ordered a very old book called Make This Your Canada. It was written in 1943 by David Lewis, a future leader of the NDP, and Frank Scott, a leading socialist thinker. There's a citation on the first page from French Socialist leader Jean Jaurès: “Take from the altars of the past the fire, not the ashes.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wanted the book because it was considered a manual of the left in those times. It would provide an idea of the party's thinking then as compared to now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no comparison. By the standards of what the party was then, today's New Democrats are a temperate, middling lot, perhaps better described as New Liberals. As a consequence, they are bringing all kinds of existential anxiety to the Grits, which was evident Sunday when candidates in the federal leadership debate tried to distance themselves from the Dippers. They have no choice. In the past, the contrasts were evident. Vote-splitting wasn't nearly as big a concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How far has the NDP come? As the words by Mr. Lewis and Mr. Scott – national secretary and national chairman, respectively, of the party then known as the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation – make clear, what the party envisioned back then was a radically new society.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The CCF,” they wrote, “would replace capitalist ownership by social ownership.” The party, if elected, would establish a national planning commission to arrange for the production, distribution and exchange of all goods and services necessary to the efficient functioning of the economy. It would take over private banks. Public utilities would be socialized. And the Athabasca oil sands would be put under public ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the election of 1945, the CCF won 28 seats. With time, the party's ideals were slowly but surely discarded. In some cases – medicare being one example, gains of organized labour being another – goals were realized. But any broader challenge to capitalism came to be regarded as a futile electoral pursuit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some hard-liners – those who took the fire, to cite Jaurès – remained. The Waffle movement of the late 1960s held to many tenets of Make This Your Canada. Well into the Jack Layton era, diehards such as James Laxer lamented the party's tepid trajectory from an advocate of public ownership to a defender of social programs. Ed Broadbent, who moderated the party to some degree under his own leadership, has warned of further moderation under Thomas Mulcair, himself a long-time Liberal. But having replaced the Liberals as the Official Opposition in the last election, New Democrats aren't arguing with success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian conservatives followed a much different path. At the time of the CCF and beyond, they were a more centrist and progressive version of what they are today. Their idealists, the right-wing purists, were viewed for the longest time as a fringe group. But they never went away and, following the rise of the Reform movement, they were able, via the 2003-2004 merger, to take over the party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upshot of it all? While it used to be that the Liberals and the Progressive Conservatives were described as Tweedledum and Tweedledee, nowadays that same descriptive better applies to the Liberals and the NDP. While there are certainly policy differences, they are not nearly what they used to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new reality creates a pressing need for the Liberals to demarcate themselves. In the leadership debate, the candidates, with rare exception, failed to do that. They trotted out one platitude after another. They pronounced themselves as believing in equality of opportunity. As a follow to that dangerously radical notion, they came forward with a call – get ready for the lawsuits! – for “more consultation” with Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have disconnected ourselves from our grassroots,” offered Justin Trudeau. Well, he may have forgotten that Michael Ignatieff grassrooted himself for the entire summer of 2010 on his much-ballyhooed Canada-wide bus tour. It produced nothing but fudge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one time, when the NDP was a true party of the left, the Liberals were able to get away with fudge. Now the game has changed. Fudge will no longer do.</p>

Are Wall Street executives “too big to jail?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chew on that one for a while.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Untouchables (on Frontline, PBS, 10 p.m.) is a transfixing, enraging examination of why a small army of greedy-guts bank executives in bespoke suits, the ones who brought down an entire economy, are moseying around, fancy-free, and not in court or in the hoosegow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's fair to wonder why. And, timed as it is to air one day after Barack Obama begins his second term as President of the United States, the program is a brutal indictment of his administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What happened in the collapse of various banks in 2008 was mind-boggling. The U.S. economy itself came to the brink of disintegration. Look around the world at the impact and it is devastating. As we now know, a vast network of banks, all in cahoots, led Europe and the United States into recession. (A very good read on the madness in Europe is Michael Lewis's book Boomerang: Be prepared to be stunned by it.) Around Europe, former bank execs have been prosecuted and some are doing jail time. In the United States, nothing more than finger-pointing has happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Frontline program, written and produced by Martin Smith, begins with an assertion by a <span class="companylink">U.S. Justice Department</span> official that “greed is not necessarily criminal.” It then looks at the difference between greed and criminality and finds copious evidence of criminal fraud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the core of the program is an examination of what was at the core of the banking practices that precipitated the crisis – the banks knowingly packaged and sold toxic mortgage loans to investors. These dubious loans should never have been given in the first place. The banks knew that and merrily stepped around financial safety standards to keep the game going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Particular attention is paid to <span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial</span>, which, in 2006, financed 20 per cent of all mortgages in the United States. Its business plan was simple, we are told – “a loan for every customer” was the motto. Even if the customer had no income. A former employee, who questioned the viability of some loans, was told, “If they can fog a mirror, we'll give 'em a loan.” Total jiggery-pokery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So mortgages, based on unverified information and inevitably headed for collapse, were sold and resold, with everybody along the banking line getting a fee, and nobody being bothered to make it stop. We hear from a “Due Diligence Underwriter,” a person tasked with assessing the loans and mortgages, who says, “It wasn't uncommon for underwriters to laugh at the loans being given.” But his boss would dismiss the concerns and say, “The loan looks reasonable to me.” The boss's bosses would then sell a package of dubious loans to investors with an assertion that everything was fine. At one point, Countrywide was estimated to have assets of $200-billion. When it was acquired by <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> in 2008, its assets were estimated at only $2.8-billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What emerges is a picture of dubious practices unchecked. And then what emerges is a number of politicians and officials seething with rage that fraud charges have not been brought against key players.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot of people are mad at the <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Justice</span> for failing to press charges. Former senator Ted Kaufman (a Democrat who was appointed to fill Joe Biden's Senate seat when Biden was sworn in as Vice-President in January, 2009) was, as the program says, “determined to see bankers in handcuffs.” But try as he might, nothing happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kaufman left Washington in 2010. His chief of staff, Jeff Connaughton, remains perplexed that prosecuting Wall Street was never a priority for the Obama administration: “You're telling me that not one banker, not one executive on Wall Street, not one player in this entire financial crisis committed provable fraud?” he asks incredulously. “I mean, I just don't believe that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, there is a sort-of explanation from Lanny Breuer, assistant attorney-general for the Department of Justice's criminal division. Wringing his hands and obviously a bit nervous, he says, “I think there was a level of greed, a level of excessive risk taking in this situation that I find abominable and very upsetting. But that is not what makes a criminal case.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was the most liberal President Barack Obama seen in some time. The United States is on the comeback trail, he said in his second inaugural address, and now it needs to share the wealth and truly provide equal rights for all – women, black people, the poor, gays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after an election largely about the economy's slow recovery, Mr. Obama had disappointingly little to say about how he would speed it up. “An economic recovery has begun,” he said, which set up his key message: “Our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it.” Perhaps, but a growing many have not been making it at all, and it would nice to know his vision for how that might change.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the heart of his speech was a paragraph that started with a nod to Republicans – he said he accepts the need to reduce health-care costs and the deficit – and ended by bashing, implicitly, the harshness of Republican hardliners, as exemplified by Mitt Romney's “47 per cent” comment during the election. “The commitments we make to each other – through Medicare, and Medicaid, and Social Security – these things do not sap our initiative; they strengthen us. They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.” There was more of Mr. Obama in that one line than in most of his cautious, barely partisan first inaugural speech in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Canadians, Mr. Obama's reference to climate change – that the U.S. will lead a transition to sustainable energy – may prove important; Canada has been justifiably concerned about being out of step with the U.S. in fighting carbon emissions, not wanting to put Canadian businesses at a disadvantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the weekend, Republicans gathered at Williamsburg, Va., adopted a less confrontational stance than in the recent past, suggesting they are prepared to work with Mr. Obama to raise the country's fiscal ceiling. Although Mr. Obama repeated the word “together” several times, he made his activist liberal agenda clear to Republicans. To his credit, he also hinted to Democrats that they should be pragmatic, and not expect the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For now decisions are upon us, and we cannot afford delay,” he said. “We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama has a full plate – immigration reform, gun control, the fiscal ceiling (just for a start) – and he has set out his values up front. But it will take negotiations, compromise on both sides and exceptional political skill to achieve his goals.</p>

Efforts are under way to launch similar negotiations between the United States and the EU, which could overshadow the proposed Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between Canada and Europe, if the CETA talks drag on. As Lawrence Herman of Cassels Brock LLP puts it, there is a “downside risk that the final deal with Canada is delayed and that the EU then turns its attention to negotiations with the Americans.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, at the very start of his country's presidency of the G8 this year, wrote to the G8's other leaders, saying that, in trade, “the single biggest prize of all would be the beginning of negotiations on an EU-U.S. trade agreement.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European and American civil servants have been preparing for a U.S.-EU trade round, for about a year.

As Arancha Gonzalez, the chief of staff of the Director-General of the <span class="companylink">World Trade Organization</span>, recently said, the objective should be a convergence of regulatory policies – full standardization is too much to hope for, from great economic powers accustomed to impose their own standards and policies on smaller neighbours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, one can conceive of a merger of Nafta and a transatlantic trade agreement – a group of democracies in which Canada would not be the most populous country, but a vital linchpin.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span> still without an even-strength goal two games into the season, and the power play a feeble 1-for-7 in its last outing, Randy Carlyle wants his forwards to start crashing the net.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In particular, the Leafs head coach wants 6-foot-3, 200-pound left winger James van Riemsdyk to heed this command.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are times you have to dig and get a whack to score a goal, like sometimes you have to take a bodycheck to make a play,” Carlyle said after Tuesday's practice. “That's no different than going to the front of the net. It can be a war zone at times.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble is this invokes a phrase often heard during the reign of recently departed general manager Brian Burke – forcing square pegs into round holes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Van Riemsdyk is only 23, but in his three <span class="companylink">NHL</span> seasons with the <span class="companylink">Philadelphia Flyers</span> before coming to Toronto in an off-season trade, he did not show an appetite for using his size to make goaltenders uncomfortable and create scoring chances. He prefers to use his deft touch with the puck to get goals (although his top total was 21 in 2010-11).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Van Riemsdyk is not the only forward being told to do something outside of his comfort zone. The top line of centre Tyler Bozak and wingers Phil Kessel and Joffrey Lupul are not bruisers by nature, either, although they spent more time in <span class="companylink">Buffalo Sabres</span> goaltender Ryan Miller's crease than anyone else in last Monday's 2-1 loss. But that line has the skill to score without knocking bodies around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carlyle's main concern is with his second and third lines. Mikhail Grabovski, Clarke MacArthur and Nikolai Kulemin have not left opponents sore after a game, while van Riemsdyk and linemates Nazem Kadri and Leo Komarov also need to step up their physical play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Leafs offence should get one boost this week, when slick defenceman Jake Gardiner is expected to return from a concussion suffered Dec. 8 in an AHL game. Gardiner, 22, made the trip to Pittsburgh, where the Leafs will play the Penguins Wednesday, after being cleared for contact in practice. However, he may not get in the lineup until Thursday's game at home against the <span class="companylink">New York Islanders</span>, or perhaps Saturday, in New York against the Rangers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for van Riemsdyk, he may have the size to play the net-crashing game Carlyle wants but there is a lot more to it than that. The front of <span class="companylink">NHL</span> nets is not a hospitable place. There are all kinds of belligerent fellows there, such as Penguins defenceman Brooks Orpik (6 foot 2, 219 pounds), who don't mind serving up stick sandwiches or crushing a few spleens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going into what a lot of hockey people call the “dirty area” of the ice takes as much want-to as size. There have been countless players with size and skill who did not stick in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> or never realized their potential simply because they could not force themselves to be aggressive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carlyle made it clear van Riemsdyk has to find that quality in a hurry. Right now, according to the coach, he is a player who is “in-between” playing a skill and a physical game and not doing either particularly well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have a plan for van Riemsdyk,” Carlyle said. “There's some things we would like him to change and we will make sure he is well-aware of those things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He's got to go into the dirty areas – I'll take your phrase. We want to see him drive that puck to that area, push people off the puck. I wouldn't say he's an overly aggressive player from a body standpoint. But he's got a big body with skill and he can score goals.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Van Riemsdyk says he is still trying to get comfortable playing a new system and thinks a few bounces got away from him thus far. But he doesn't sound like someone who embraces a hard-hitting game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think I can score in a lot of different ways and being in front of the net is one of them,” he said. “I've definitely been around the net a lot in the last couple games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I've been there tipping some pucks and that's an area where you score a lot of goals, so I think I'll continue to do that.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be an understatement to say that Martin Cauchon, the last-minute ninth contender in the federal Liberal leadership race, did not make a lasting impression on Canadians.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, as Mr. Cauchon was about to announce his candidacy after months of dithering, an Angus Reid survey found that his name rang a bell for no more than 16 per cent of respondents, just 3 percentage points more than Martha Hall Findlay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is surprising, as just nine years ago, Mr. Cauchon was a key minister in Jean Chrétien's cabinet – and a strong advocate for same-sex marriage, a groundbreaking issue that should have stuck in people's memories. Perhaps, because of the massive flow of information on the Internet, people's memories are overloaded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There may be another reason why Mr. Cauchon sank into oblivion. Although he is competent and personable, there is something bland about him. He has no striking features, either physically or intellectually. His program is a desperately dull repetition of the Chrétien years, as if nothing has changed in Canada and the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His blueprint for the future is a return to Lester B. Pearson's policy of “peacemaking,” devised half a century ago; the return of the long-gun registry, which was a resounding failure; and a return to the era when the federal government tried to micro-manage the health-care system. Welcome to the Canada of the 1960s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though Mr. Cauchon, at 50, is among the younger candidates in the Liberal race, and even though he publicly admitted to having smoked marijuana (really, who hasn't?), he looks and sounds like an earnest but rather boring, old-style politician. Now this might be an unfair impression. Maybe the triumphant figure of Justin Trudeau, the personification of youth, sex appeal and excitement, makes everybody else look old and square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cauchon has something else working against him. He doesn't have a political base. The Outremont riding he represented from 1993 to 2004 – one of the safest Liberal seats in Canada – was grabbed by the NDP's Thomas Mulcair, and Mr. Cauchon was unable to take it back in the 2011 election, when Mr. Mulcair got more than twice as many votes as the former justice minister. Mr. Cauchon will not confront Mr. Mulcair next time. A native son of La Malbaie, he intends to run in Charlevoix, where he unsuccessfully ran against Brian Mulroney in 1988.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During his absence from politics, Mr. Cauchon, a lawyer with <span class="companylink">Heenan Blaikie</span>, rarely intervened in public affairs – even though he envisioned several comebacks, including a run in the 2006 leadership race. One of his former associates told a reporter that he just doesn't have a clue why Mr. Cauchon was joining this leadership race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless Mr. Cauchon surprises everyone – nothing of the sort happened during the rather tedious Sunday debate between the candidates – he probably won't have a chance to play the kingmaker or establish himself as a force to be reckoned with by the future leadership of the party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of his old pals from the Chrétien era are solidly behind Mr. Trudeau, if only because he seems to be the only one capable of bringing the Liberals back to power. And the Paul Martin clan hates Mr. Cauchon for supporting John Manley after Mr. Chrétien's resignation. As for the post of Quebec lieutenant, it would probably go to Marc Garneau, the former astronaut and MP for Westmount–Ville-Marie, who's been running a solid campaign and is a more popular public figure than Martin Cauchon.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not an expert in the criminal justice system. Just a product of it. The story of Ashley Smith, the teenager who strangled herself in her prison cell as guards watched, has prompted me to speak out. But for fortune, that could have been me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 15, I ran away from a brutally abusive father. Homeless, freezing, I broke into office buildings for a place to sleep. It was a relief to be arrested. At least it meant a roof over my head and three meals a day. I did not know it also meant a free education in a predatory, upside-down society where the strong rule, the weak are victimized and the inmate code is all that matters.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The guards lock the doors and enforce the rules, but the inmates run the joint. Break the rules and you get a few days in the “hole.” Break the code and you can get killed. Fighting is a survival tool, but it's assault in the eyes of the law, punishable with more time. If a kid is driven to attempt suicide or self-harm, well, that's also punishable. That's how Ashley Smith, originally charged as a juvenile with a minor crime, ended up serving time as an adult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was just one of thousands of lost, homeless kids – kids you see on the street every day. I was not beyond redemption; they just treated me as if I was. The lessons of prison guarantee failure after release. In no time I was back, recycled for four more years in hellholes like the Burwash Industrial Farm, a notorious labour camp south of Sudbury that has since been closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are we treating troubled kids any differently today? Clearly, the vicious cycle of recidivism is alive and well. A staggering 90 per cent of young offenders sent to prison reoffend within two years, according to a recent Manitoba government report. And meanwhile, despite evidence that it is ineffective policy, the federal government is getting “tough” on crime, imposing mandatory sentencing and building more prisons to house more criminals, even as the crime rate continues to fall. More and more prisoners show up with mental illnesses. They don't get better in jail. They get worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every one of these men and women was once a kid we didn't care about. These aren't “other people's” kids. These are your kids, your neighbour's kids. A full 6 per cent of Canadian children aged 12-17 were accused of a crime in 2010, according to <span class="companylink">Public Safety Canada</span> statistics. Most were not charged or imprisoned. But new changes to the Criminal Code will ensure that ever more of them are crushed in the gears of the criminal justice system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Music saved me. It was a crazy fluke that I ever discovered my talent. At the age of 21, two convictions under my belt, I walked out of Millbrook prison with 20 bucks in my pocket, a mail-order guitar and the dream of becoming a blues singer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I survived a system that fails us all. Not Ashley Smith. When she strangled herself in her segregation cell, the only people who could have saved her watched and did nothing. Call it crying for help, attention-seeking behaviour, whatever you want. She did not deserve to die. Canada's Correctional Investigator has repeatedly called for an end to solitary confinement. Nobody listens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, as a coroner's inquest reconstructs her last moments, all of Canada is watching. Will we fail her once again? Will we do nothing once again? The cold gears of our justice system are tearing apart others like her at this very moment. Why do we remain unmoved?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I lived in Palo Alto, Calif., in the seventies, Oakland was not a place to visit – too druggy, too scary, too violent. Now, the reinvigorated city is almost unrecognizable. It is bursting with exciting restaurants and artisanal producers making fabulous pasta, tofu, chocolates and more. Cheaper real estate, easy access to Northern California's vast bread basket and ethnic diversity all helped to foster the burgeoning foodscape; indeed, The New York Times recently voted it the fifth-best food destination in the United States. Here are a couple of my favourite Oakland recipes.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HORSERADISH EGG SALAD</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beauty's Bagel Shop in Oakland pays homage to Beauty's in Montreal, where owner Blake Joffe's father grew up. His savvy take on vegetarian deli food includes an unforgettable egg salad on a Montreal-style bagel that is balanced with salt and does not have that underlying sweetness. Everything is lovingly handmade. For this recipe, use horseradish as a great flavour enhancer. Serve it on bagels for a Sunday brunch or spoon over lots of bitter lettuce as a first course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Prep time: 25 minutes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Ready in: 35 minutes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Serves: 8</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tanya Holland, owner of Brown Sugar Kitchen and B Side Barbecue in Oakland, serves unforgettable crunchy and flavourful fried chicken as well as rich, smoky barbecue. She trained at the prestigious La Varenne cooking school and worked in top restaurants around the U.S., but when she opened her own placed, she turned to her roots for Southern-inspired dishes. Her spectacular take on fried chicken is traditional, spicy and crisp. Holland serves this in true Southern fashion with waffles, but I prefer buttermilk mashed potatoes and crisp green beans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Prep time: 10 minutes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Ready in: 30 minutes, plus marinating overnight</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Serves 4</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 tbsp dried tarragon</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mix tarragon, paprika, onion powder, 2 tsp salt, 1 tsp black pepper, garlic powder, oregano, thyme and cayenne together in a small bowl. Place chicken in a large bowl and sprinkle with spice mixture and parsley, tossing to coat. Pour buttermilk over chicken. Cover and refrigerate overnight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remove chicken from marinade. In a large bowl, combine flour, remaining 1 tbsp salt, and remaining 1 tbsp black pepper. Dredge chicken pieces in seasoned flour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pour oil into a large pot to a depth of 3 inches and heat over medium-high heat until a thermometer reads 350F. Add as many chicken pieces as possible without crowding the pan. Cook chicken pieces, turning occasionally and adjusting heat to keep oil between 340-350F, until deep golden and cooked through. Smaller pieces will take 5 to 7 minutes and larger pieces will take 12 to 15 minutes. Remove chicken to a rack and allow to rest 5 minutes before serving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEPPI'S PICKS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For egg salad, you want bold fruitiness to counterbalance the mustard and horseradish here as well as sharp acidity to cut through the mayo. It helps, too, when you've got herbaceous notes to resonate with the dill and celery. New Zealand sauvignon blanc meets the criteria, though you can't go wrong with almost any lean, crisp Mediterranean white.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the fried chicken, stick with the sauvignon blanc, its citrusy tang is able to offset the oil. But there are slightly better options. Riesling and gewürztraminer go beautifully with the herbs and spices in the batter. For red, try Beaujolais or barbera.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I last gave a whisky nod to Robbie Burns Day, a couple of readers wondered how I could possibly exclude their favourites. I'm sure Laphroaig and Lagavulin were on their lists, and top drams they are. But there are also several thousand other Scotches out there, and only about 800 words in a column. Something's got to give, and that includes some of my own favourites, which I've reviewed before, like Ardbeg 10, Highland Park 18, Balvenie 15 Single Barrel, Talisker, Old Pulteney and – when I fancy something on the rocks – Johnnie Walker Red.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, to be clear, what follows are tasting highlights based on recently released (or re-released) products available in Canada. But, so as not to deflect legitimate complaints altogether, in a sacrilegious move I'm including two Asian offerings. Perhaps they won't be your top choices for a toast on Jan. 25, but, hey, at least I didn't include wine or rum, which Burns drank from time to time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Burns Arran Single Malt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Scotland)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Score: 90; Price: $39.95</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Independent distiller Isle of Arran, patron of the World Burns Federation, is the only whisky-maker to use the poet's image. Though he spent no time on Arran and had no connection with this producer, founded in the 1990s, he was born not far away, in Ayrshire on the west coast. There's a pronounced note of pear here, followed by vanilla, honey-lemon tea and soda bread. A delicate dram for early evening. $56.99 in British Columbia, $54.98 in Saskatchewan, $39.55 in Newfoundland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glenfarclas 105 Cask Strength</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10 Years Old (Scotland)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Score: 95; Price: $81.95</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another rare independent, owned and run by the fifth and sixth generation of Grants, Glenfarclas is known for Speyside whiskies strongly influenced by time casks that once contained Sherry. At 60-per-cent alcohol, this is powerful stuff, yet its complexity is never obscured by heat. Expect sweet candied orange up front, with added nuances of toffee, vanilla, spice fruit and chocolate all carried on an oily-rich texture. Sublime. $73.50 in Quebec, $69.99 in New Brunswick, $62.48 in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Té Bheag Nan Eilan Gaelic</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whisky (Scotland)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Score: 92; Price: $37.35</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The late Sir Iain Noble, who founded and later sold his holdings in British merchant bank Noble Grossart, bought land on the Isle of Skye with his fortune. He also funnelled money into causes to advance Gaelic language and culture, which explains the unusual-looking name of this dram made by his distillery called Praban na Linne. Té Bheag (pronounced “chey vek”) can either mean “the little lady” or “wee dram.” It's unusual for a blended whisky in that it's not chill-filtered, a cosmetic practice that removes fatty-acid esters that turn a spirit cloudy when mixed with ice. The technique also is believed to strip subtle flavours and oily texture. This is one of the finest blended Scotches anywhere, based in part on sherry casks and containing a good amount of single malt from Talisker, the only single malt distillery on Skye. It's richly textured, with luscious toffee and cereal in perfect proportion, supported by a whiff of smoky peat. $35.25 in Quebec, $36.99 in Nova Scotia, $37.06 in Newfoundland, $36.90 in Prince Edward Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Famous Jubilee (Scotland)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Score: 91; Price: $39.95</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Famous Grouse, a bestselling blended brand in Scotland, created this premium edition to commemorate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee last year. It's a splendid effort, containing barley malts from esteemed Highland Park and The Macallan in addition to grain whiskies. Full-bodied for a blend, with rounded sweetness evolving into fruit, cereal and mellow oak, it finishes with a peaty sea breeze. Available in limited quantities in Ontario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nikka Whisky Single Malt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miyagikyo 15 Years Old (Japan)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Score: 93; Price: $189.20</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masataka Taketsuru, born to a sake-brewing family 100 kilometres south of Hiroshima, journeyed to Scotland almost 100 years ago to study at the University of Glasgow. He returned with a degree in applied chemistry, a wife named Jessie Roberta and a passion for whisky. After a stint as the first master distiller for the company that would become Suntory, he founded Nikka in 1934. Now owned by brewer Asahi, Nikka was instrumental in cultivating Japanese whisky's up-market status. This is superb, as the price would indicate. Mouthwatering at first, with a rounded barley-malt richness and fruity middle, it turns pleasantly dry, with a hint of smoke. I'm glad Taketsuru applied himself to whisky rather than, say, haggis sushi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kavalan Concertmaster Port Cask</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finish Single Malt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Taiwan)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Score: 89; Price: $113</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where many whisky brands prefer to have you believe they're run by old farmers in overalls rather than by conglomerates, Kavalan is proud to let the more than one-million tourists a year who tour its visitor centre know it's part of King Car Group, a 2,000-employee company that also produces soft drinks, coffee, instant noodles and chewing gum, among other goodies. That's confidence. Aged initially in former bourbon barrels, this was finished for a short period in port casks for a touch of fruit. It's silky and honeyed, with dried apricot and barley notes as well as a pleasant earthy note that, for me, brings to mind camembert rind. Three years ago, a Kavalan whisky beat three Scottish blends in a Burns Night faceoff judged by experts in Scotland. Not bad for an Asian conglomerate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Patricia Barnes crosses East Hastings Street, she points out a sign rising from the sidewalk that lists the diverse merchants in her neighbourhood on Vancouver's east side.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sign touts the array of attractions in the Hastings-Sunrise area, from independent coffee houses to family-run restaurants to chain stores. Looking up, Ms. Barnes sees a banner for East Village – the rebranded name for the business strip along East Hastings, from Commercial Drive to Renfrew Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As executive director of the Hastings North Business Improvement Association, she is out to place the spotlight on an area that is too often overlooked for dining and shopping, despite its handy location roughly six kilometres east of downtown Vancouver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday at noon, she had her cup of java from the Laughing Coffee Bean, one of the many highlights along East Hastings. There are grocers – Donald's and Como Market – and a wide range of restaurants, including the Penny, Red Wagon Cafe, Tacofino, Campagnolo Roma, Rainbow Sushi and Slocan. Dayton Boots, with its distinctive boot-shaped sign, remains a landmark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To clear the air on a controversy, Ms. Barnes said East Village is a label that refers to the collection of businesses, and isn't intended to replace Hastings-Sunrise. What's in a name? Signals Design Group Inc. came up with the East Village terminology in co-operation with the local business improvement association last spring, and the idea is to create a feeling of community among the merchants, and get the residents on side, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a marketing and branding strategy for the business improvement area, within the Hastings-Sunrise neighbourhood,” she said. “Critics have their own opinions, but it is not a renaming of the whole neighbourhood.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sumiko Grace, a bartender on East Hastings, said the East Village banners on utility poles that now dot the streetscape won't fool anyone into conjuring up images of the East Village neighbourhood in Manhattan. “I think it is ridiculous. A lot of Vancouverites still haven't adapted to the name change yet,” said Ms. Grace, who was born and raised on Vancouver's east side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shane Simpson, the NDP member of the provincial legislature for Vancouver-Hastings, said it will take a further period of adjustment to get used to the new brand. “Well, it will always be Hastings-Sunrise to me for the area, but the commercial strip has been renamed East Village,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether it's Rio Friendly Meats or Ugo and Joe's Lucky Meats or London Drugs, Mr. Simpson said there are a range of specialty shops and chains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current site of London Drugs will be redeveloped into a huge new store at street level, with three storeys of condos above, dubbed the Alba project. “Traditional, family oriented, multicultural, Hastings-Sunrise is an entire community unto itself, only minutes from downtown,” according to Alba's sales pitch for the 108-unit project that will combine retail with residential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condos will start at roughly $320,000 for a one-bedroom suite – relatively affordable, by Vancouver standards. Construction is scheduled to begin this year, with completion expected in 2015, and London Drugs will operate in a temporary location until the reopening as one of the largest among the chain's outlets in Metro Vancouver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Young, director of brand strategy at Signals Design Group, said East Village merchants are part of the Hastings-Sunrise community. “Our exercise was a brand renewal. It's an exercise in bringing awareness to the area. It has a very strong and independent community spirit, and there is change for the better. The merchants want to survive and do well,” Mr. Young said, noting that there are 22 business improvement areas in Vancouver. Each non-profit improvement district receives funding through special property taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">East Village's tagline – “A vintage neighbourhood with a progressive attitude” – narrows down the essence of the brand, Mr. Young said. “It's important that communities have centres and places where locals can go, and they're not having to travel too far. Many of the merchants have character and are a bit unique to the area,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is free one-hour parking along large stretches of East Hastings, and there are rewards in discovering the shops, once you look beyond the four lanes of traffic that include large trucks. In the long term, there will be an opportunity to review the zoning in the district along Commercial Drive, north of East Hastings, where light manufacturing is currently allowed. Ms. Barnes, however, envisages a future where there are offices for engineers and architects to replace the remnants of Vancouver's industrial past.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada has had one of the most generous – if not the most generous – refugee-determination systems in the world.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, after a while in office, every government wants to change the system, often for good reasons. The refugee policy world is complicated, what with court rulings, quasi-judicial hearings, immigration lawyers, lobby groups, international conventions, less-than-complete documentation of some claims and plenty of genuine refugees fleeing fear of persecution as well as economic migrants posing as refugees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ideally, a refugee system should be fast, thorough and fair. Not everyone would say the Canadian system is fair, although by world standards it is, but almost no one would say it is fast. Backlogs of tens of thousands of claimants have plagued the system. Those backlogs historically have produced amnesties and periodic but unsuccessful changes to speed things up. Today, there are about 42,000 cases in the queue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, along comes the Harper government's new refugee policy, crafted by the energetic Jason Kenney, Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism. It went fully into force on Dec. 15. Whether it will work better than the previous system obviously cannot be predicted. On paper, the new system looks like an improvement. At the very least, it deserves a chance to succeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new system sets up three classes of refugees instead of two. As before, there will be refugees identified as such abroad and brought to Canada. This category – people in “vulnerable situations” – will be increased to as many as 14,500. A government willing to bring in more of these refugees can hardly be accused of being “anti-refugee.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are people who land in Canada and claim refugee status. A new category has been created – claimants from designated countries of origin. There are 27 of them for now – 25 in the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>, plus the United States and Croatia. These are countries with democratic governance, independent judiciary, protection of human rights, free press and so on, from which few successful claimants can be expected. Anyone applying from these countries will get one hearing within 30 to 45 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of them will fail, and unsuccessful claimants will not have the right to appeal to the Immigration and Refugee Board, as do claimants from non-DOC countries. They can appeal, however, to the Federal Court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This DOC identification has some refugee advocates upset. They say everyone deserves the full appeal procedure, regardless of their country of origin. The government relies on a balance-of-probability analysis, defending the DOC system as faster, cheaper and fairer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The initial DOC list, however, is bizarre. It includes Sweden and Denmark, but not Norway, Switzerland or Iceland, presumably because they are not in the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>. It somehow misses Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, the list will be updated to include many more countries. Some should be from Latin America, where people from every country now require visas to travel to Canada – a political irritation, an expense (for the traveller and the government) and unnecessary for established democratic countries such as Chile and Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third category – and the largest – will be from non-DOC countries. These claims will be heard by civil servants, with appeals allowed to a new Refugee Appeal Division. Other changes envisage faster removal from Canada of unsuccessful applicants and the removal of a provision that allowed unsuccessful claimants to avoid deportation while they appealed to the Federal Court. It was this long delay – on average, four to five years – that allowed people to remain in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kenney reforms aim to find the right balance between being fair to would-be refugees with plausible claims and being active in bringing refugees already defined as such from abroad, while being stricter with false claimants and trying to make the entire system deliver judgments much more quickly than the previous one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be some time before anyone knows if the minister has found the balance among these competing priorities. Once immigration lawyers begin to work with the new system, they will find ways of elongating procedures. And no one should be surprised if someone launches an appeal against parts of the new system in the courts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the new system works as intended – and many other reform efforts have failed – Canada will be well-served.</p>

If we have learned anything from such horrors, it is that they are preventable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emmanuel Owusu-Ansah, a 30-year-old charged with first-degree murder in the death of Bridget Takyi, 27, of Toronto, should be presumed innocent. But it is important to ask questions while the memory is fresh. It is important to express outrage at yet another brutal death that didn't need to happen.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How is it that Mr. Owusu-Ansah was free on bail when he was accused of killing Ms. Takyi, a mother of two? On Dec. 5, he was accused of committing a great deal of violence against her. There were three counts of assault. There were two counts of assault with a weapon. There were another two counts of possessing a weapon dangerous to the public peace. And there was a single count of threatening death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What sort of risk assessment was done before he was granted bail? He was out on house arrest – a strange compromise in a case that would have raised red flags. A bail condition is not punishment; it's meant to ensure that the public is safe and that the accused person shows up for trial. House arrest as a bail condition suggests that the court recognized a risk. (The judge's reasons for granting bail in this case are covered by a publication ban.) Is house arrest the court's attempt at wishful thinking in such situations?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This chain of events calls to mind the justice system's failure in British Columbia in 2007 to prevent Peter Lee from stabbing to death his son, his wife, her mother and her father before killing himself. The police told the Crown he was a bad risk for bail; the Crown didn't seek to deny him bail, and said later the police offered a weak case to deny bail. The province later accepted an inquest's recommendation to improve risk assessment for the police and Crown attorneys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faced with repeated acts of alleged violence, including the use of a weapon and a threat of death, the justice system in Toronto failed to protect a young mother of two small children from a horrific death. We need to know why.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian novelist and short-story writer Caroline Adderson has been long-listed for the world's richest short-story prize, the £30,000 ($47,000) Sunday Times <span class="companylink">EFG Private Bank</span> Short Story Award. One single short story will win this. There are 16 stories nominated, many of them by big names: Junot Diaz, Ali Smith, Mark Haddon, Graham Swift. The eligibility criterion for the prize is that the author must have been published, either in book or magazine form, in the United Kingdom or Ireland.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story that Adderson submitted, called Erection Man, has not been published anywhere; she sent it in cold. Interestingly, the story had been rejected by a couple of major publications. (It's still sitting on the desks of a few big-magazine editors; let's see if they read it a little more closely now.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The short list, of six, will be announced in a month – each of these finalists will win £1,000 ($1,600). The winner will be announced in Oxford on March 22. Interestingly, since the creation of the prize in 2010, not one of the winners has been from Britain. So our girl has a chance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I honestly didn't even notice it was for £30,000 when I submitted,” Adderson says on the phone from Vancouver, where she lives and teaches. All the stories submitted were judged “blind” by the five-person jury (a jury that included U.S. novelist Lionel Shriver and British novelist Joanna Trollope), but now that the names of the finalists have become known, some of the larger reputations may have an edge. Adderson herself is an unassuming personality; she is not a frequent tweeter or public diarist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story that got her this far is one of a series she is writing around the life of an imaginary Vancouver woman called Ellen McGuinty. This one is written from the point of view of a young man, Ellen's casual lover, at a stressful Christmas gathering with his real girlfriend and his unsophisticated family. It exemplifies Adderson's trademark wit: her burying of tensions in bantering dialogue, her fixation with absurd details. Her characters are deeply Vancouver in all their preoccupations, from craft-fair pottery to hydration systems for long-distance cycling, and also refreshingly horny (especially Ellen, who is generally somewhat impatient with the vacillating men she uses for her sexual needs).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adderson has already published several of the Ellen stories in the kind of Canadian literary journal that is known mostly to people in the business of literature (Eighteen Bridges, The New Quarterly, Canadian Notes &amp; Queries). One of them was selected for the collection Best Canadian Stories. When the cycle is complete, she will publish them as a novel she plans to call Ellen In Pieces. This is a popular thing to do these days among short-story writers, who all know that publishers, especially major ones, are not keen on short stories – they don't sell well. They would rather call a book a novel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I had recently read a number of books that were called novels but just linked stories,” Adderson says. “That's just a marketing device. But I want to see if I can do it.” She points out that earlier collections of linked stories – such as Alice Munro's Lives Of Girls And Women – could have been rearranged and marketed as novels as well. Times have changed; we don't seem to value the particularly difficult craft of the miniature in an era of doorstopper trilogies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a new challenge to be found in writing self-contained stories that when put in sequence create a larger narrative, Adderson says. “I just love the short-story form. A novel and a short story are not in the same family. The novel is a dramatic form, the short story a poetic one. That's not to say it doesn't have a narrative – it does, it's just the language that drives the story.” What she is aiming to do is to take these individual “poems” and organize them in such a way that they reach a climax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm going to try to resist making a pious point about how Canadian artists are so often recognized abroad while going unknown in our own media. Sometimes the opposite is true. I can at least hope that this recognition, among the very best writers in English in the world, will bring attention not only to this non-lucrative art form but also to a Canadian artist of dazzling talent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caroline Adderson will be giving a lecture with videos, as part of Rye-berg Live, in Vancouver at Club PuSh on Granville Island, on Jan. 27 at 7 p.m.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Attention people of the Canadian TV racket.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You – yes, you, the ones who think you're so clever, classy and creative – have recently spent a good deal of time and money copying American reality shows. Canada's Got Talent. Big Brother Canada. The Amazing Race Canada. Undercover Boss Canada. The Bachelor Canada. Enough, already.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the way – The Bachelor Canada is being renewed, after considerable thought from the Rogers/CITY people. Not that it will be produced again this year. Oh no, dude. It will return in 2014. Because it will take that long to find another manly man to match the abundant charms and innate grace of the infamous Brad (Brad) Smith. And, having already used the tactic of dragging red, raw meat through the hills and valleys of certain areas to attract potential bachelorettes from their lairs (or so the rumour goes), a new and more cunning ruse to induce such alleged ladies will be needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fear not, a new ruse will be conjured up. These particular Canadian TV racket people are, after all, the very people who are so wily they recently decided to stop calling CITY-TV by its name, “CITY-TV,” and just left the channels named “City,” dropping the “TV” part. Just in case anyone got the impression they were watching TV or something. Good money was spent on that move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I digress. Herewith, a proposal for an original Canadian reality-TV show – Stroller Wars: Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here in the centre of the universe, the public has been galvanized (a painful affliction, given the weather) by a public complaint at a <span class="companylink">Toronto Transit Commission</span> meeting about the number of baby strollers being allowed on buses. Makes it difficult for other passengers, was the gist. The commission and certain public officials took the complaint to heart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This being Toronna, civil war has broken out. Via social media, itsy-bitsy TV reports and online comments. You have not seen piety and self-righteousness until you've witnessed this civil war. (Well, in fairness, you've seen piety and self-righteousness if you've watched Sun News, but the channel's main aim is to get you to pay for watching the channel, even if you wouldn't dream of watching.) A vast army of stroller owners have risen to their own defence. TTC officials are on the defensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, it is a fact that the issue is real. Like anyone who lives downtown I'm often gobsmacked by the sight of a bourgeois mom dragging a stroller the size of a Nissan Pathfinder onto a bus, streetcar or the subway. And it is, as they say, a “bourgy” thing. The ostentation of the giant stroller is the hallmark of the well-off, middle-class mother.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just think of the richness of a TV show based on the antics of the stroller owners and those who loathe them. It's class war; it's generational war. And think of the live-event spinoff that's possible – Monster Stroller Derby at the <span class="companylink">Rogers Centre</span>. (Which used to be called the SkyDome and possibly by the time you read this will be called “The Rogers.”) I can see so many possibilities. Queen West moms versus Beaches moms. The winner might be decided by challenging finalists from downtown to take the subway to Finch and manoeuvre the giant stroller onto the Finch West 36 bus for a trip to Jane and Finch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A cool idea would be to have the stroller owner made to alight from the Finch bus because the Mayor needed it to pick up his high-school football team. But I will leave the strange plot-twist details to the professionals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, the rest of Canada would love it. And then would come, inevitably, Stroller Wars: Vancouver and Stroller Wars: Halifax. (Stroller owner pushes stroller up Spring Garden Road, fails to get the thing on the bus at the stop near South Park Street and nips into the Lord Nelson for a stiff gin and tonic.) Listen, it beats Big Brother Canada, The Amazing Race Canada, Undercover Boss Canada and The Bachelor Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People of the Canadian TV racket, get on it. You're welcome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airing tonight</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why Men Cheat (CBC, 9 p.m. on Doc Zone) is not necessarily what stroller moms need to be interested in. It doesn't explain much. In fact it is a lightweight, lurid doc that amounts to a catalogue of indiscretions by what are called “high-status males.” That means a regurgitation of the antics of every dude from Henry VIII to Tiger Woods and Silvio Berlusconi. There are many, many scenes of scantily clad women and much footage of dancers in strip clubs. Some so-called experts appear and talk about powerful men feeling the urge to prove their power by having sex with many women. We're told that “men's roles are in a massive state of flux,” but that idea is not built upon. The silliness is summarized by one pundit who says, “Male sexual response is what it is.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kings' coach Darryl Sutter – surrounded by family, and as close to his hometown of Viking as is possible in the NHL – riffed on that theme after Wednesday's afternoon practice in preparation for a date with the <span class="companylink">Edmonton Oilers</span>. Sutter doesn't hold much for sentimentality, or what happened in the past. Apart from defenceman Drew Doughty, who drew high praise for his play in the first two games, Sutter wasn't thrilled with much of what he's seen so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“One of the things about the 48-game schedule, it's not about what you did or what you might do, it's what you're doing,” Sutter said. “That's the fact. There's not enough difference between the teams. We've seen it twice. We've seen [Chicago's] Jonathan Toews and last night, No.9 [Colorado's Matt Duchene] – dominant players at that position, because they're young and they're ready to go. They're spot on already.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you look at the game we played last night, Duchene kicked our two centremen's asses. When he had to do, he did.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kings just got Anze Kopitar, last year's leading playoff scorer, back in the lineup for the 3-1 loss to the Avalanche, a game which L.A. dominated for 40 minutes, but couldn't put away. Kopitar was injured playing in Sweden just before the lockout ended. Thus far, all of L.A.'s scoring has come from the fourth line. Kyle Clifford and Jordan Nolan (five points between them) are outscoring the rest of the team combined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is Sutter's third crack at a post-lockout coaching assignment, but suggested it doesn't get any easier, even knowing what he knows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's so hard to get a read on things because everyone's different,” Sutter said. “Quite honestly, you don't know where they're at training coming in – and you've seen it. Some of our guys' pace isn't where it's gotta be and you're not sure how to get it there, quite honest, because you don't have the practices to do it. You're doing a lot of talking about it, but then, having them actually do it during the game, that's the tough part.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kings essentially stood pat in the off-season, returning every player that was in the lineup the night they knocked off the <span class="companylink">New Jersey Devils</span> for the Stanley Cup back in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think that's an advantage for us – no new coaches, no new players, no new philosophies,” said Kings defenceman Rob Scuderi, who previously won a championship in Pittsburgh as well. “Sometimes, I guess you can argue that there's some complacency with all the same pieces, but with a shortened season, I would hope it'll be an advantage for us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's been seven months. We've had our ceremony – and it has to end there. If we keep looking back and thinking how great we were, we will have a hard time being good this season.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The playoff run, us winning, that's over with,” added centre Jarret Stoll, the former Oiler. “We don't even talk about that. We've just got to get that battle back that we had for those two or three months – and get it back as quickly as possible because of how short the season is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“With how we won, we won with everybody going – four lines, six D, Quickie was great obviously. That's how we're going to have to play. That's how we played for two periods [Tuesday night], but obviously, we need more.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kings' special assignments coach, Bernie Nicholls, played in the shortened 1994-95-season for the <span class="companylink">Chicago Blackhawks</span> and was a top-20 scorer in the league that year. Nicholls is a calming influence in the team's dressing room and cautions patience, suggesting that the Kings will eventually find their rhythm again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's not so much the 48 games for these guys, it's what they're coming off,” Nicholls said. “Winning the Cup, then first game, we got the ceremony, ring stuff. Last night, we played well for a while. I just think they're so good. I think they're built for the playoffs – they're big, strong and physical. To play them in a long series, I don't think anybody would want to play them in a long series.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We've had some injuries, which is fine, that's part of the game. Once the guys get back and playing and forget about last year, they'll be really good.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How much are Canadian doctors paid?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you read the newspaper headlines, you will think they are paid, on average, about $307,000. If you ask doctors – and family docs in particular – they will tell you their take-home pay is less than that of many plumbers and auto workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's perplexing is that both those statements are true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reality is that there is a distinct lack of clear information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, beyond our prurient interest, “How much are doctors paid?” is a question that has important public policy implications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxpayers, via provincial health insurance plans, fork out more than $20-billion annually for physician services. Yet, despite this expense – one-10th of all health spending and one-fifth of all public health spending – we have very little idea how much individual physicians actually earn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why does this matter?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It matters because the country's 72,000 or so doctors are on the public payroll. While they are independent contractors, almost 100 per cent of their income comes from the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It matters, too, because we should be concerned, above all, with value for money. It's pretty difficult to figure out if we're getting our money's worth out of physicians if we don't know how much money we're actually paying them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So let's look at the data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this week, the Canadian Institute for Health Information published updated numbers from the National Physicians Database.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CIHI data show a “gross clinical payment per physician” of $307,482. That ranges from $250,000 in PEI to $350,000 in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those numbers, for the first time, include fee-for-service payments and alternate payment plans. Doctors still derive most of their income from FFS – they are paid by the “act,” and those fees are negotiated with provinces. Increasingly, however, governments are moving to alternate methods of payment such as salary, sessional fees (per hour or per day), and capitation (an annual fee paid per patient).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CIHI data are also based on gross income. Most physicians, like other small businesses, have to pay overhead costs such as rent, salaries, supplies and insurance. Physicians – for the most part – don't receive benefits or have pension plans, and they can have considerable debt from years of university study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CIHI does not collect data on overhead costs, but a study published last year by the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences provides some insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That research, led by Jeremy Petch of the Li Ka Shing Institute of St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, calculated net payments to physicians in Ontario. To do so, they looked at physician overhead costs, as collected in the National Physicians' Survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overhead varies widely by specialty, from 38 per cent for ophthalmologists to 10 per cent for medical oncologists, and, of course, many hospital-based docs have little or no out-of-pocket costs. Overall, overhead for Canadian doctors is 26 per cent of their billings. Because that number is self-reported, it may be a tad overstated, but it's the best figure available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Practically, that means Canadian doctors have an average annual income (before taxes) of a little more than $225,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, again, there is a range, from psychiatrists, the specialists who bill the least ($232,000 gross; $186,000 net), to ophthalmologists, who bill the most ($676,000 gross; $418,000 net).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last piece of the puzzle is taxes. Doctors, as high-income earners, are highly taxed, right? Well, not exactly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 90 per cent of Canadian physicians are incorporated, which has some tax advantages, such as lower taxes, income splitting (paying a salary to a spouse, for example), and deferring tax payments by holding money in the corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's take a practical example of how this works, courtesy of the <span class="companylink">Canadian Medical Association</span>. A physician with billings of about $250,000 would have a net income of about $200,000 and take home $127,100 after taxes. That same physician, incorporated, would have roughly the same take-home but be able to defer taxes on $60,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What you hear, especially during contract negotiation time, is that physicians have overhead costs ranging from 40-60 per cent, and pay 40 per cent income taxes. The available data show that this is self-serving piffle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But equally spurious is the rhetoric about doctors oozing wealth. During Ontario's recent contract talks much was made of the 252 “millionaire” physicians when, in fact, those who bill $1-million are outliers, not at all representative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the crude numbers we have, we don't know how many hours physicians practice, how their income varies by years of experience and other basic information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this is to say that physicians are not living high on the hog. For the most part, they are earning wages commensurate with their training and responsibility. Many doctors are, frankly, underpaid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what doctors are paid should not be a guessing game. The lack of transparency does not serve taxpayers or the medical profession.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whenever Wayne Gretzky's name comes up in relation to a hockey job, especially among terminally obsessed <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span> fans, the resulting furor is understandable.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But ask yourself this: What exactly would The Great One do for the Maple Leafs as president?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The title may be vacant because it was one of the ones held by Brian Burke when he was fired a few weeks ago but this is president of the team, not its corporate overseer, Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd. Even though there are separate presidents and general managers for some <span class="companylink">NHL</span> teams, the president in most cases is really the GM.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the Leafs just happen to have a GM, and a pretty good one, in David Nonis. The MLSE board handed him the job when a couple of the directors managed to get their way with Burke and declared Nonis the permanent GM. He has the rest of this season plus three more years on his contract. The GM's box at the Air Canada Centre is also bursting at the seams with Leafs hockey executives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, the team president handles the business side of the operation. That has never appealed to Gretzky. And the Leafs just happen to have a long roster of business executives starting with MLSE president Tom Anselmi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is another vacant title over at 40 Bay Street, chief executive officer of MLSE but that, too, is not Gretkzy's thing. Nor is the board likely to hand over the reins of a $2-billion company to someone who has no interest or experience in guiding a corporate ship no matter how many hockey fans love him. If that job is ever filled, it will go to someone such as <span class="companylink">NHL</span> marketing guru John Collins or Tim Leiweke, who runs <span class="companylink">L.A. Kings</span> owner Philip Anschutz's sports empire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since it is their company, the MLSE directors could install Gretzky as president and tell Nonis he now has someone above him to call the hockey shots. Gretzky has experience at this, as he served as part-owner, director of hockey operations and then head coach during his eight-year association with the <span class="companylink">Phoenix Coyotes</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From that standpoint, certainly, Gretzky would feel right at home with the Leafs. In seven of the eight seasons he was with the Coyotes they missed the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> playoffs. In his four seasons as head coach, from 2005-06 through 2008-09, his record was 143-161-24 and he never made the playoffs. Oddly enough, this was despite the fact he hired a bunch of his buddies for key jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by the time he quit in September of 2009, Gretzky was making $8.5-million a year, although he did get stiffed by the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> when it bought the club out of bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So let's say Gretzky leaves the hockey operations to Nonis. What else could he do for the Leafs? Unlike in Phoenix, where it was hoped his presence would sell tickets, Gretzky could do that in Toronto. There's just one problem – the Leafs don't have any to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the blather about this, from the radio show where it started to social media where it exploded, was about the credibility Gretzky would bring to the Leafs. That, too, is vastly overstated for the reasons just listed and more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Leafs do need more respect at the NHL governors level where their economic might has never been matched by their clout with commissioner Gary Bettman and the other club owners. However, Gretzky is not likely to fix this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot of <span class="companylink">NHL</span> owners do like hanging out with celebrities. When it comes to respect in the boardroom, though, that is reserved for people who can make them more money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, this whole affair shows just how much fun it's going to be with MLSE now owned by two media giants, <span class="companylink">BCE Inc</span>., and <span class="companylink">Rogers Communications Inc</span>. Sources close to the board dismissed the notion and Gretzky himself told CBC's Hockey Night In Canada Radio show there was “absolutely no truth to it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It appears one or two MLSE directors might have discussed this on their own. The social-media firestorm started after the idea was floated on a radio show owned by Rogers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This will no doubt be the first of many such explosions in the wake of a corporate bigshot's spit-balling filtering from the BCE or Rogers executive hot tub down to the talking heads. Well, what the heck, the Leafs have always been a circus. Why stop now?</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> left its trendsetting overnight rate alone on Wednesday and made it clear borrowing costs won't increase any time soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that news presents a false picture of what's happening with the rates some people pay when they borrow money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Selectively and quietly, the big banks have been cranking rates higher for credit line and credit card customers with a less than sterling record in managing their debts. It's all part of a growing trend to tie the interest rates charged on loans more closely to the client's credit history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically low interest rates are the one legitimate excuse for this country's household debt mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's now clear that not everyone benefits from low rates. If you're not sure what your borrowing costs are, find out immediately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a business case for banks charging some people more to borrow. The higher the risk of default, the higher the rate should be to compensate the lender for the risk being assumed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But basing loan and credit card rates on creditworthiness also puts more pressure on our most vulnerable borrowers. Yes, these people bought trouble by spending more than they can handle. But charging them higher rates just compounds their problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We know the prime rate has been low, and that the forecast has been that if interest rates go up, people will be in more trouble,” said Patricia White, executive director at the non-profit agency Credit Counselling Canada. “I suspect the same thing is going to occur if financial institutions started charging more for products.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion Bank</span> is just now sending letters to customers of its Emerald low-rate Visa card that announce higher and lower rates for some, and no changes for others. Note: This is a card for people who regularly carry a balance and want to avoid the usual credit card rate of 19.99 per cent. On its website, TD says the new range for the Emerald low-rate card will range from prime plus 1.5 percentage points to prime plus 12.75 points, compared to prime plus 1.75 to prime plus 9.75 now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank said in an e-mail response to questions that the changes were made on what it calls a “risk-based” approach. “The higher the credit rating a customer has, the better their chances of seeing their rate decrease or remain the same.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</span> gave notice in the fall that it would raise rates on unsecured lines of credit for a small number of clients. In a copy of a notice forwarded to me by a reader, the rate was to rise to prime plus 6.25 from prime plus 4.25.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We review our rates on an ongoing basis to ensure the pricing is appropriate,” CIBC said in an e-mailed response to a query. “Client risk profiles and other factors are used to determine pricing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CIBC's rule with unsecured credit lines is that you pay the higher of $60 a month or 3 per cent of your balance. Your payments might not change if your interest rate went up, but the pace at which you knocked down the amount you owe would slow because of the extra interest costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TD adjusted unsecured line of credit rates a year ago and in 2009. In the most recent round, 40 per cent of affected clients saw rates decrease and 60 per cent saw an increase. A TD letter sent in by a reader showed an increase of 3.75 percentage points over the old rate. The bank said credit line rate adjustments were made according to a client's credit situation and his or her relationship with the bank as it relates to loans and investments held.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you receive a notice from your bank about an increase in your borrowing costs, take it as an indication that your credit score needs work. Verify your credit file is in good order by requesting a copy (see sidebar), and then get to work cleaning it up. Factors that hurt your record include:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• late payments;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• using more than 35 per cent of your available credit;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• multiple inquiries about setting up new credit;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• reliance on a single borrowing vehicle, say a credit card.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> has made it clear that low rates will be with us a while longer, but there's some fine print on this outlook. It only applies to people who manage their borrowing well.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dalton McGuinty was ready, in what felt like his last day on the job, for the inevitable questions about the apparent mess he's leaving behind.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Any objective observer would have to conclude that when it comes to the big things, we got those right,” he said at what might have been his last press conference as Ontario Premier. Then, and again later on Wednesday heading into his final cabinet meeting, he rattled off a list of accomplishments that included higher student test scores, shorter hospital waiting times and cleaner air.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McGuinty has every right to take pride in these aspects of his record, and others besides. Yet to look at the immediate future of the country's largest province as he makes his exit is to doubt that he can really feel all that satisfied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denying most interview requests, he has made it clear he does not believe he owes anyone a window into his soul. But from his infrequent public appearances in recent months, it has been possible to piece together a sense of how he would like us to view his legacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Every time Ontarians see a hospital being expanded, or a school being built, or new pipe being laid beside the road, or new transit being installed, it lifts us up a little bit,” he said to a conference on public-private partnerships. “It reassures us that we are on track as an economy and a society; that we are fulfilling the responsibility owed by the older generation to the younger one; that we never stop working hard to build a bright future for our children and our grandchildren.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those last lines seemed fitting for a Premier who tended to lose a bit of his customary aloofness when he was around kids. But what exactly has he left them?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The provincial deficit of $11.9-billion is, without adjusting for inflation, more than double the one he inherited in 2003. Much of that sum can be attributed to economic circumstances beyond his control, but the Premier also ignored looming cost pressures (caused largely by an aging population) until his final couple of years in office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labour peace, purchased at considerable cost, eroded at almost the first sign of fiscal trouble. Today, the environment in the province's schools is nearly as toxic as it was under his Progressive Conservative predecessors, and in a best-case scenario, the relationship with teachers – instrumental to those improved test scores – will take years to rebuild.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Greater Toronto Area, the province's economic engine, is so clogged with congestion that it is becoming almost impossible to move around. Mr. McGuinty's Finance Minister, Dwight Duncan, has effectively acknowledged that while their government upgraded crumbling infrastructure elsewhere, it did not do enough to improve transit in relatively good times; nobody knows where money will come from to fix it now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other parts of Ontario wish their problem was accommodating all the traffic. Particularly in the province's southwestern rust belt, where Mr. McGuinty's controversial green-energy plan hasn't counterbalanced the decline of the manufacturing sector as hoped, the worry is instead about becoming hollowed out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Partly because of that green-energy strategy, the last election revealed an Ontario more divided than at any time in recent memory. Amid deepening resentments, common purpose seems a long way off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the matter of how Ontarians view their government, and its ability to meet its myriad challenges. Mr. McGuinty, a personally upstanding father-knows-best sort, should if anything have been able to help give politicians a slightly better name. Instead, he stuck around long enough to be tainted by scandal and then headed for the hills while suspending the legislature – playing into “these guys are all the same” sentiments that fuel mounting disengagement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is perhaps too easy to itemize an outgoing premier's shortcomings, without giving credit for tough decisions and sharp policy focus. Financial stability would be further off if Ontario were not moving faster than most other provinces to modernize health care. The economic outlook might be dimmer if Mr. McGuinty had not expended political capital by overhauling the sales-tax system. A generation would be less prepared if not for his wonky interest in unflashy education policies that prevent kids from slipping through the cracks. The auto industry might be dead if he had not taken leadership on a bailout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, it could be a whole lot worse. And it is entirely possible that after his ugly exit has faded from memory, Mr. McGuinty will be viewed as having done more good than harm, which is as much as most politicians can hope for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, though, it was slightly unnerving to hear him drawing on his recent trip to China to imply that Ontarians should be grateful they have it better than most other populations. For a Premier who for years has ended almost all his speeches by referring to Ontario as “the greatest province in the best country in the world,” the bar is surely higher than that.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are you freezing? Join the crowd. Arctic air is sweeping across Canada. Snow and ice are wreaking havoc on Britain. Russians are dying from the cold. And Germans are sneaking into forests to cut down trees because their fuel bills are so high.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hey! Whatever happened to global warming?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a naive question, of course. Everybody knows there's little or no connection between daily weather events and climate change (except when there's a heat wave, a hurricane or some other natural disaster, in which case global warming is invariably to blame). Experts will tell you that our bitter winter weather proves nothing about climate change – that the world is still warming up at an alarming rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, maybe not so alarming. Global temperatures have now held steady for 16 years. They levelled off around 1997. The latest data come from Britain's weather and climate agency, the <span class="companylink">Met Office</span>, which says you can't draw any conclusions from such a short span of time. Still, the data are proving awkward for leading climatologists, who are reluctantly admitting that their projections have their limits. Nor is the news likely to increase support for activists such as NASA scientist James Hansen, who warned, in an interview with The Guardian back in 2009, that Barack Obama had only four years to set an example for the world and avert disaster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not questioning the basic science of global warming. The last decade was the warmest on record, and the next one may be even warmer. My point is that our uncertainty about the future is rather great. Our economic models turned out to be lousy. Why should our climate models be better?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Climate models do a poor job of making predictions on decadal time scales,” Judith Curry, the head of the climate science department at the <span class="companylink">Georgia Institute of Technology</span>, told me in an e-mail. “Climate models capture some elements of climate change, but they have deficiencies in the simulation of natural internal variability.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, climate change is very, very complicated. Greenhouse gases emitted by burning fossil fuels are just one factor that affects the climate. Others – ocean temperatures, soot, clouds, solar radiation etc. – turn out to be a lot more important than we thought and aren't so easily captured by computer models.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm also skeptical about our ability to do something intelligent about it. Some of our policy responses to climate change have been a complete disaster. The <span class="companylink">European Union</span> had the bright idea of setting up a system to trade carbon emission permits. So how has that worked out? The recession came along, and today the permits are all but worthless. According to the Swiss bank <span class="companylink">UBS</span>, the scheme has cost European consumers about $280-billion for “almost zero impact” on carbon emissions. Meanwhile, artificially high electricity prices have made many European industries uncompetitive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble with many well-intentioned climate policies is that the law of unintended consequences works overtime. Take the sorry history of biofuels, which were supposed to green up the world by substituting for fossil fuels. The rush to biofuels has caused massive deforestation, disrupted commodity markets and pushed food prices to record highs. Poor people are suffering so that rich Europeans can get 10 per cent of their fuel from renewable sources by 2020 – all in the name of saving the planet. Meanwhile, governments are extracting hundreds of billions of dollars from frigid German and British consumers to pay for extravagant subsidies of uneconomic solar and wind power sources. (That's why the Germans are cutting down trees this winter.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people say the risk of climate change is so great that we need to act now, because doing something is better than doing nothing. But that's not always true. So far, global warming policies have probably done far more harm to the planet than global warming has. Climate change is still poorly understood. Policy is hard. We should be humble about what we know and what we don't.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario is facing long-term economic challenges, and of the provincial Liberal leadership candidates with a serious chance of succeeding Dalton McGuinty as Premier, Sandra Pupatello understands that best. Ms. Pupatello speaks with knowledge and conviction about jobs and the economy. In her former role as minister of economic development and innovation, she worked closely with business and industry. Of the other candidates, only Harinder Takhar has demonstrated a similar focus. It is the overarching issue facing the next premier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As they meet this weekend, Liberal delegates should reflect on what the economist Don Drummond tried to drill home in his report issued less than one year ago: “We can no longer assume a resumption of Ontario's traditionally strong economic growth and the continued prosperity on which the province has built its public services. Nor can we count on steady, dependable revenue growth to finance government programs.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is all well and good to do as Kathleen Wynne, the other leading Liberal leadership contender, and some of the other candidates have done in this campaign, and emphasize social issues. Ms. Pupatello would doubtless also like to live in an idyllic society, but she understands that what is required first is economic and fiscal leadership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Again from the Drummond report: “Unless policy-makers act swiftly and boldly … Ontario faces a series of deficits that would undermine the province's economic and social future.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wynne is a tenacious and earnest competitor. But her strategy is flawed. Offering herself up as the conscience of the party might appeal to some delegates who equate Liberal values with leftish activism. In fact, that is what the NDP already does, and the idea that Wynne-led Liberals would hive off support from the social democrats is a stretch. It could just as well work the other way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under Mr. McGuinty, Ontario started to adjust to its immense fiscal challenges, including confronting public-sector pay demands, even at the risk of alienating the Liberals' base. Finance Minister Dwight Duncan announced this week a glimmer of light, that Ontario's deficit is $3-billion lower than projected, thanks in part to some of these difficult decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Pupatello seems to understand that deeper deficit financing is not the answer, and that this is the start, not the end, of what is required. Yet she is not endorsing anything more radical than a better managed version of the status quo. If elected, she may yet have to follow some more of Mr. Drummond's advice and pursue more aggressive change: “Do not hang onto public assets or public service delivery when better options exist. Consider privatizing assets and moving to the private delivery of services wherever feasible.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Pupatello has another advantage over her opponents, and not just in the Liberal leadership race but among opposition parties as well: She is an effective communicator, exuding a personal warmth that may help her sell the inevitably tough fiscal medicine Ontarians will have to take in the years ahead. The Liberals have not really recovered since winning the last election with a minority. Mr. McGuinty failed to adjust to the party's reduced circumstances, and allowed the opposition to define the political agenda. Ms. Pupatello was out of politics during this shambolic interlude, and is largely untarnished by it. With Sandra Pupatello, the Liberals will have focused and energetic leadership to make up for lost time and lost credibility. She is the best choice for Liberals.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Tuesday's election, Benjamin Netanyahu is no longer “King Bibi” – as Time magazine crowned him last year. His Likud-Beitenu party still has a plurality of Knesset seats and will form the next government, but the Prime Minister and the right have lost their unchallenged grip on Israel's political map. Led by centrist Yair Lapid, whose Yesh Atid party was formed a year ago, a crop of new faces will dominate the Knesset and cabinet. And if these novices' political skills extend beyond their campaign success, this election could end up being the first step in a long-term shift in Israel's political landscape.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign and election results exposed latent undercurrents affecting Israeli society since the middle-class protest that swept the country in the summer of 2011. The protest seemed to be dormant since then, but its influence permeated the “how,” “what” and “who” of this campaign. The protest's young, educated leaders used technology to mobilize hundreds of thousands across the country, making the campaign of 2013 Israel's first real social media election. Most campaign headquarters paid far closer attention to <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> and <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> than to television coverage of their candidates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The protest focused on housing prices, taxation and the unequal burden imposed on the majority – who serve in the army, work and pay taxes – versus ultra-orthodox men, who are exempt from military service and whose families receive large welfare benefits. Protest leaders never mentioned the Palestinian issue or the cost of Israeli construction and incentives for those living in West Bank settlements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the most part, the campaign mirrored this pattern. Only the Meretz party on the left and Tzipi Livni's centre-left Hatnua (12 seats combined) made a deal with the Palestinians a priority. (Even Israel's marginalized Arab parties spoke more about domestic issues this time.) Mr. Netanyahu spoke generally of the need for a strong leader. Mr. Lapid spoke vaguely of the need for talks. And Labour's Shelly Yachimovich declared the issue irrelevant at present. On the right, another attractive political novice, Naftali Bennett of the Jewish Home party, didn't hide his plan for annexing a majority of the West Bank but ran on a domestic agenda aimed at attracting religious and secular Israelis alike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2011 protest was marked by fatigue with old-style politics and cynicism toward promises few believed would be honoured. When it came to voting, young Israelis came out (overall turnout was 66.6 per cent, almost two percentage points higher than in 2009) and voted for the three newcomers – Mr. Lapid, Mr. Bennett and Ms. Yachimovich (a new party leader, although a Knesset member for seven years) and their lists of fresh candidates. The results are impressive: Of 120 Knesset members, more than 50 were ousted and more than 40 first-timers got in. Many of the new parliamentarians are women; many boast successful records in civil-society organizations, NGOs, business and media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Tuesday, a strengthened Israeli right seemed a foregone conclusion. But that's not what the public wanted. It didn't veer to the left but placed Mr. Lapid firmly in the centre as the linchpin of the next government. For now, at least, in yet another echo of the summer of 2011, the right-left divide is blurred. No one's rushing to act on the peace front, and the critical issue of Iran will be debated across party lines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, Mr. Netanyahu identified the core domestic issues facing the new government: affordable housing, a more equitable sharing of the burden of military service, electoral reform. These come straight out of Mr. Lapid's platform and, if they remain priorities, will determine the choice of coalition partners. This may lead to strange bedfellows. For example, Mr. Lapid and Mr. Bennett can agree on an arrangement for drafting ultra-orthodox men, yet are far apart on the Palestinian issue. But if they compromise enough to be inside the tent together, Mr. Netanyahu will be spared the pressure of what he fears most: a narrow, right-wing, ultra-religious cabinet and a more nationalist Likud caucus than in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, caution is prudent: Israeli centrist parties tend to be short-lived. (In the most recent example, Kadima won 29 seats in 2009 but barely made the two-seat minimum this time. Many of its disillusioned voters moved to Mr. Lapid.) Expectations of Mr. Lapid are high if not excessive. Even though Mr. Netanyahu's position has been weakened, the Prime Minister is a shrewd and seasoned tactician who may manipulate and outsmart his imposed political partner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are early days. Coalition negotiations will be protracted, and a new government may be weeks away. The spin machines are talking about a broad government, and pundits already predict that its inevitable incompatibilities will lead to another round of elections within two years. In the meantime, how the game is played by the new people will determine if election 2013 was really about change.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So now we know: Europe will be roiled by internal turmoil for another five years. While Germany, France and others struggle to build a stronger core for Europe around the euro zone, British Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservatives, if elected in 2015, will try to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership in the EU and then put that “new settlement” to the British people in an “in or out” referendum by the end of 2017.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">World, you have been warned. Europe as an economic giant? Yes, still. Europe as a strong force in a new multipolar world? Postponed indefinitely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what of the speech itself? Well, it could have been a lot worse. As a pro-European who has argued that Britain should hold an “in or out” referendum in the next Parliament – once the shape of euro zone-Europe and the results of any attempted renegotiation of the terms of Britain's membership are known – I can hardly complain when the British Prime Minister plumps for exactly that. While much of the phrasing of his announcement was patently crafted to please euroskeptics, some of his criticisms of today's EU are also justified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Above all, the peroration of the speech was as clear, eloquent and forceful an argument for Britain staying in the EU – on clear-sighted, hard-nosed Palmerstonian grounds of national interest – as you could hope to hear from a leader of today's British Conservative Party. Those last minutes confirmed me in a view that I have taken against nervous British pro-Europeans for some time: When it comes to the point, the British people will vote to stay in the EU.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet they also confirmed the futility of his entire strategy. Those basic arguments of national interest for Britain to stay in the EU will remain true however paltry the results of any formal renegotiation after 2015. In fact, since Europe is a permanent negotiation, Britain would get a better deal if it remained fully involved and visibly committed all the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If other EU member states agree on nothing else, they agree on this: Britain should not be given any major new exceptions from the rules of the whole EU club. Now they will concede even less. If EU politics were a game of bridge, Mr. Cameron has just effectively thrown away his ace: the credible threat of Britain leaving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also bad for Europe. Some of the good reforms Mr. Cameron is preaching at continental Europeans are now even less likely to happen, since, whatever he says, Britain's partners all feel that he is batting for Britain, not for Europe. In a rare and revealing stumble by this otherwise accomplished speaker, when he was arguing for his preferred option of a new reform treaty for the whole of the EU, he said, “But if there is no appetite for a new treaty for us [pause, stumble] … for us all …” Freudian slip or Thatcherite one: That's what most continental Europeans think he subconsciously means.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet, even though it would have been better for Europe to carry on without this added diversion to the core problems of the whole project, a referendum would have come sooner or later anyway. With the stakes raised like this, it will be hard for other parties to refuse the British people a direct choice. As a nice Polish phrase has it: We have to swallow this frog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the world will yawn its way through five more years of euro shemozzle. And it will deal with Europe as it finds it: economic giant, political hydra.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here in India, one hears of a liking for London as a place to live and do business; of admiration for British universities (if only the Cameron government's misbegotten student visa squeeze does not prevent their children from studying there); of some attachment to British traditions of literature, good government and common law (an Indian shipping merchant tells me he makes contracts with Chinese partners under English law). But there is absolutely no echo of the neo-Tory idea that a special relationship between Britain and India or Britain and the whole Commonwealth could be any substitute for Britain's place in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, the point is this: History has dealt Britain an amazing hand. While a shadow of its former imperial self, the country has unique ties to Europe, to the United States, to the rest of the English-speaking world and to quite a few other places (in Latin America, for example) as well. Who but an idiot would throw away one of his strongest suits? And we Brits are not idiots, are we? Are we?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It didn't take long for the <span class="companylink">B.C. Teachers' Federation</span> to shoot down the provincial government's proposal for a 10-year peace agreement. Premier Christy Clark would hardly have been surprised by the union's response.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was no way the union was going to gift-wrap a winning issue for Ms. Clark's Liberals mere months in advance of a general election campaign. The BCTF wants the governing party to lose and lose badly. That said, the union's obduracy will not stop the Premier from campaigning on a populist idea that many British Columbians will likely heartily endorse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that includes many teachers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the timing, it's difficult to separate the politics of this plan from any merits it may possess. Is this a genuine effort by the government to repair one of the most dysfunctional and disruptive relationships in the province, or an attempt to stump and grandstand on a proposition that many voters would cheer? The government knows that the Opposition New Democrats could never endorse the policy, which ensures that the Liberals' archrivals won't benefit politically from any positive response it might engender on the campaign trail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Setting motive aside for a moment, however, it's hard not to approve of the plan's underlying intent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Students in the K-12 system in B.C. have been ill-served for too long by the broken association governments in B.C. have had with teachers and their bargaining agents. And certainly both sides have been to blame. In the last decade, the animus between the governing Liberals and the BCTF has been almost palpable at times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But is this plan the answer to repairing relations?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dedicated fund to address education priorities is certainly something for which educators have long been calling. The establishment of a new policy council that would include various stakeholders in education seems like a sensible idea. A compensation system that is based on the average of major public-sector wage increases is a formula many people in the private sector would accept in a minute. And a new bargaining system that gives teachers the full right to strike – while a gamble – does make the process more transparent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What I particularly like about the new bargaining plan is that if the two sides can't agree on a new contract, the teachers would have to declare at the beginning of the school year if they are going on strike or not. If the teachers decide to strike, it's better that it happen at the beginning of the school year, rather than in the middle or three-quarters of the way through. That way, whatever time is lost through strike action can be tacked on to the end of the school year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So there is a lot to like in this plan. But there are two central issues that rankle the union. One is compensation. The BCTF doesn't believe teachers should be measured against other public-sector unions in B.C. It wants teachers here to be rated against what teachers in other parts of the country are making. On some levels that is understandable. Doctors make the same argument. So do other professional groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at the end of the day, it's what the government in this province is able to pay, not what the governments in Alberta or Saskatchewan or Ontario are able to give their educators. This is an ideological divide between the BCTF and government that I'm not sure can be easily bridged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other issue the BCTF has is class size and composition. Teachers recently won back the right to bargain these areas. The BCTF asserts that this plan effectively takes that right away and puts it in the hands of the policy council whose decisions aren't necessarily binding. (The provincial government disputes this.) Beyond that, the union is only one voice at the table. It is outnumbered by other stakeholders who may not view the world the same way it does. So I can see why the union isn't buying the idea. This aspect of the government's proposal would have to be changed for it to have any hope of flying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be too cynical to completely dismiss this 10-year proposal as a publicity stunt in advance of an election, because it contains many recommendations that have been made in the past by well-meaning educators who have worked in the system for some time. And the fact is, we do have to find a better way when it comes to the relationship between government and the province's teachers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether this document provides that way remains to be seen. But it should at least serve as a starting point for a reasonable discussion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Presented with the scenario during an editorial board meeting this week, Sandra Pupatello laughed.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Are you trying to talk me out of this?” she joked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a little too late for that, and in any event, Ms. Pupatello does not give the impression of someone who frightens easily. But the question that was put to her, about the messy set of circumstances that would ensue if she emerges victorious from this weekend's Ontario Liberal leadership convention, is giving pause to the fellow candidates whose support she will need to put her over the top.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Dalton McGuinty's successor as premier, the immediate to-do list – which will include choosing a new cabinet, hiring new staff, preparing a Speech from the Throne, launching an overdue budget process, trying to restore some degree of labour peace and finding common ground with the provincial opposition – will be enormously daunting. Ms. Pupatello, unlike fellow front-runner Kathleen Wynne, would have to do all that while also seeking a seat in the Legislature during a by-election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the least, she would be distracted, putting off not just the Legislature's return but also some of her preparation for it. Considering that the Windsor seat that Finance Minister Dwight Duncan has promised to vacate is held by the NDP federally, and that unions might flood the riding in an attempt to embarrass the Liberals, there is also a very real chance that Ms. Pupatello would lose, plunging the government into crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another possibility is also making the rounds. A good number of Liberals are speculating that Ms. Pupatello might bypass such prospects altogether, in favour of quickly plunging the province into a general election – something that she has generally seemed more disposed toward than the other candidates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While much of this chatter is coming from Ms. Wynne's camp, it's not limited to there. Nor is it difficult to imagine how such a decision might be justified. Ms. Pupatello has pushed back against election concerns by saying one of the first things she plans to do is talk to Progressive Conservative Leader Tim Hudak and the NDP's Andrea Horwath about making the minority legislature work; she could emerge from those discussions saying that their unreasonable demands require her to seek a stronger mandate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If nothing else, all this is driving home the likelihood that the government would enjoy more short-term stability under Ms. Wynne. That's problematic for Ms. Pupatello, because with their party trailing in the polls and in need of major rebuilding, many Liberals want to keep governing for as long as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The uncertainty is particularly complicating the looming decisions for Harinder Takhar and Charles Sousa. Running fourth and fifth, respectively, the relatively right-leaning candidates are seen as more ideologically aligned with Ms. Pupatello than third-place Gerard Kennedy or sixth-place Eric Hoskins, and thus likeliest to throw their support behind her on later ballots. But Mr. Takhar and Mr. Sousa both come from suburban ridings that are far from secure – and sources say that Mr. Sousa, in particular, has expressed concern about going to the polls too soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such concerns will, of course, be balanced off against other considerations, so Ms. Pupatello could well emerge as premier in spite of them. But for all that she's able to laugh off post-convention circumstances, others are finding that a bit more difficult.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have friends we've hung out with since high school. We all got married around the same time and had a bunch of kids all close together. However, our values are going in different directions. They thought we were crazy for having our kids in the hospital, and feel strongly that home birth is the only way to go. They will only eat organic, and consume only raw, unpasteurized milk that they buy right from farmers. I no longer like to ask them over for any type of meals, unless I cheat and go to Whole Foods and then scatter organic labelling everywhere to seem acceptable. God forbid the TV is on when they stop by as it is strictly no screens for their kids, and passing along our hand-me downs is a “no no” because we don't use/can't afford strictly organic material. In a nutshell, our formerly fun, easygoing pals are now “Healthier Than Thou” and getting together is a stressful, no-fun situation, where I don't feel I can be myself any more. Is the only thing holding this relationship together nostalgia? Should we just cut our losses and move on?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only you can answer the first question. As for the second, I would say: Don't give up on your friends just yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm loath to cut ties with anyone unless it's over something huge. Maybe I'm just the clingy type.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after all, this might just be a phase. Lots of people go through a sanctimommy/sanctidaddy phase early on in their parenting trajectory. Eventually, exhaustion kicks in with its little baby jack-booties, and they drop the raw, locally sourced milk for a scotch on the rocks, as nature intended. (“We don't do pop,” a [recovering] sanctimommy said to a friend of mine once, refusing a proffered soda. Now she and her kid guzzle it by the gallon, apparently.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's all a blur, but I remember saying to myself (and, unfortunately, to others) before becoming a parent: “When I have kids, I might allow them to watch a certain highly restricted amount of television – but they will never, as God is my witness, play video games.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I weep with laughter, and roll my eyes at the naïveté of the callow youth who uttered these proclamations. Though it's true we have a “no screens Monday to Friday” policy chez nous these days, and I do feel good about that … But mainly, I've got three kids and my own problems! If they are uninjured at the end of the day, I feel like I've accomplished something. “My kids were raised in an atmosphere of benign neglect,” I now tell people, “and I only say ‘benign' to make it sound good.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, there's an entire sanctiparenting subculture out there supporting your friends' obnoxious, hoity-toity behaviour. In my theory, it's because we haven't been involved in a world war for a while. Drop a couple of bombs on us, start rationing gas and chocolate, have some sterno-heated Spam for dinner (if you're lucky!), and people will very quickly start being less precious about what type of cotton a shirt's made from.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyway, I do think you should cut your friends a little slack. Think of them like people who just quit smoking, or found religion. They want to proselytize, baby! I'm sure you can find a friendly way to curb and curtail some of their more egregious excesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like, I'm reading between the lines here a little, but it sounds like they come to your house and criticize – or refuse! – the dinner you offer them because it does not conform to their lofty standards?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nix to that. That transgresses ancient, tribal law. You come into my tent and turn up your self-righteous, pompous proboscis at the food I have prepared for you? You need to bring a big old clown shoe down on that type of behaviour immediately. If they don't like it, they don't have to eat it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And their position on hand-me-downs is absurd. Hand-me-downs equal thrift – which is better for the environment. Actually, don't even get me started on that one, I'm seeing red.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The screen thing falls in a bit more of a grey area, IMHO. Maybe all things considered your kids could turn off the TV when their no-screen friends come over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in general I'd say every time your friends get preachy or try to boss you around, firmly but gently push back. Just shrug and say something like: “To each his own.” Or: “Well, works for us.” Eventually, they should get the hint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If not – if they continue to be all high and mighty – well, then you have my permission to drop your superior, self-satisfied friends like a locally sourced, organically farmed hot potato.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What am I supposed to do now?</p>

Kesean is far from the first agonizingly young victim. The names of the others, thankfully, are few and far between – though perhaps not as far between as some might think.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shyanne Charles, 14, died in a shootout at a community barbecue this past summer. Ephraim Brown, 11, was killed in 2007 when he was caught in a shootout. Jane Creba, 15, died in the Boxing Day shootout on Yonge Street in 2005.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the handguns used are illegal. No one has suggested that the populace should be armed against those who would kill a nine-year-old in his own home. That would truly be madness. But the killing of Kesean Williams in his Brampton home is one more reminder that Canada is not immune from gun violence – and that the police and the communities in which guns and gangs are more common need to work closely together to make sure no one with a gun in his hand feels a sense of impunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario will soon have a new premier, and Toronto may soon have a new mayor. They, and neighbouring municipalities such as Brampton, need to make it a priority to support troubled communities and fight gun violence.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement that Theresa Spence has ended her hunger strike is good news for the many Canadians who were concerned about her well-being. Her supporters are grateful for her sacrifice and believe she brought her people's issues to the forefront, where they belong. But in the broader issue of native rights, Ms. Spence accomplished little other than to polarize existing divisions within the first nations leadership and alienate Canadians who felt her tactic was extortionate and went on too long. She created problems, and solved none.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Spence's failing was that, while there was sympathy for her cause and for native people, there was little support in the non-native population for her demands in general, and to the tactic of hunger-striking in particular. Canadians are not blind to the troubling conditions on some native reserves, and to the plight of native peoples in urban areas, but they do not believe it is entirely the fault of the federal government. They know that Ottawa funds first nations communities to the tune of billions of dollars annually and, to a large degree, lets those communities manage the money. And they know that some native reserves are successful and well run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Spence's hunger strike seemed to be saying that the dire housing conditions in her home town of Attawapiskat, where she is the chief, were entirely the fault of Ottawa, and that the only solution was to give her people more money and more land. She refused to consider that any other factors, such as her town's extreme isolation and lack of a local economy, were in any way to blame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She aggravated that sense of entitlement when she dismissed as a “distraction” an auditor's report into the finances of Attawapiskat that found numerous deficiencies. She did so again when she refused to end her hunger strike after the Prime Minister met her demand to meet with native leaders. A poll taken during her hunger strike showed that Canadians' attitudes toward first nations had been hardened by her actions and words.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As well, her liquid diet opened up deep divisions within the leadership of the <span class="companylink">Assembly of First Nations</span> from which it needs to recover in order to continue effectively as a national body. And, though not her fault, her attention-grabbing protest hijacked Idle No More, a worthy grassroots movement that has brought attention to native issues through peaceful, non-confrontational means.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no question that claims over broken treaty promises, Ottawa's slow movement on pressing issues, and the inclusion of changes to environmental protection laws deep in the bowels of its latest omnibus budget bill have aggravated its relations with first nations. And there is no reason to doubt Ms. Spence's conviction and courage. If her hunger strike achieved anything, however, it was to damage first nations' interests.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1651</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Canadians seem baffled by the insistence of Chief Theresa Spence and other first nations leaders on meeting with Governor-General David Johnston – and not just for a ceremonial encounter, but for an extended policy discussion. What's going on here? Didn't they study responsible government in Political Science 101 and learn that the governor-general always acts on the advice of the prime minister and cabinet?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actually, native leaders' focus on the governor-general as the representative of the Crown is based not on a lack of information about the Constitution but on a different understanding of it. They know perfectly well that the prime minister and government of the day are installed by the political process of the nation of Canada, but they don't see themselves as part of that process and that nation. They see themselves as separate nations, dealing with Canada on a “nation to nation” basis. They see the Crown as a governmental structure above Canada – and therefore the authority with whom they should deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sovereign nations do not legislate for each other; they voluntarily agree to sign treaties after negotiations. The radical conclusion from this premise is that Parliament has no right to legislate for aboriginal people without first getting their consent. Hence the hue and cry about consultation and the demand to repeal those parts of the government's Budget Implementation acts that allegedly impinge on aboriginal and treaty rights. Today's claim is that Parliament had no right to amend the Indian Act and the Navigable Waters Protection Act before consulting with (read: getting the approval of) first nations. But the same claim could be made regarding any legislation, for all laws made by Parliament affect native people. Enforcement of the Criminal Code arguably affects aboriginal rights by putting large numbers of aboriginal people in jail, and so on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This indigenist ideology is not new. It started to appear in the 1970s, as a reaction to Jean Chrétien's 1969 White Paper, which proposed repealing treaties and abolishing the special legal status of Indians. In its usual well-meaning but sometimes witless way, the Canadian political class thought it could deal with the reaffirmation of indigenism through word magic. Adopt the vocabulary of the radicals. Start calling Indian bands “first nations.” Pretend to recognize their “inherent right of self-government” or even “sovereignty.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But talking the talk has not been enough. Aboriginal leaders, at least the more radical ones, also want Canada to walk the walk. Yet Canada still legislates for native people, still decides unilaterally how much money to transfer to first nations, still demands reports on the spending of that money. That's not how nations ought to treat each other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, one may ask, if first nations really are sovereign nations, why should Canada support them at all? In the international sphere, nations are expected to support themselves. But indigenist ideology has an answer for that question, too. The first nations have paid in advance by allowing the colonizers to share their resources. They never surrendered their ownership of the land (though that's what the written treaties say). They agreed only to share it, and for that they are entitled to a perpetual share of resource revenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ideology is a direct challenge to the existence of Canada as a state. There are only 193 United Nations member states. Canada is not going to last long if it really contains more than 600 sovereign Indian bands, now known as first nations, plus the Métis, plus whatever the courts eventually determine non-status Indians to be. That's why no prime minister should agree to a working meeting between the governor-general and the <span class="companylink">Assembly of First Nations</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa-based Mediamiser is one of the firm doing exactly that, scraping and analyzing the approximately 1.3 million hockey tweets produced since the latest NHL lockout began on Sept. 15, 2012. Mediamiser's findings show the difference in opinion between negative and positive tweets was remarkably close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Approximately 16 per cent of the messages recorded about hockey till the Jan. 6, 2013, settlement were negative towards the league and players versus 12-per-cent positive. (Tweets sharing other information were considered neutral in the study.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, the negativity grew over the course of the lockout, said Jim Donnelly, director of data for Mediamiser. By last October, the tweets were 21-per-cent negative and 14-per-cent positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The increase in positive tweets can be attributed to users indicating they missed hockey and wanted it back ASAP,” Donnelly said in a e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By January, however, with a settlement imminent, opinion flipped. The breakdown was 22-per-cent positive and 16-per-cent negative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“News of the lockout's end caused a 155-per-cent spike in NHL-related tweets from Jan. 4 to Jan. 6,” Donnelly said. “Positive sentiment on that day [Jan. 6] toward the league was close to 30 per cent.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of the top 10 hashtags in January's NHL tweets, were #finally and #endthelockout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit team-brand loyalty, Donnelly said. “We even found that, of those fans who said they were still upset with the league, they were also very explicit in saying they would still go out of their way to support their favourite team.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing that did not move the needle, however, was NHL commissioner Gary Bettman's apology to fans in early January for all the damage the labour dispute had caused.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donnelly believes the value in analyzing social media is only beginning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Generally, as more people use <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> to voice their opinions or feelings on various issues, its data has become more valuable to those looking to gauge what people are saying/feeling/thinking about an issue,” he said. “<span class="companylink">Twitter</span> and other social media are emotional medias, where people log on to speak their minds. We feel it's very appropriate for an issue such as this, which has inspired passionate commentary from fans on all sides of the issue.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spin the dial</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gord Stellick has left SiriusXM satellite's Hockey Night in Canada Radio to return to Sportsnet Radio The Fan 590 as host for its <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span> coverage. Stellick previously co-hosted The Fan 590 morning show with Don Landry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It represents a move into Stellick's comfort zone, as the former Toronto general manager can wallow in all things Maple Leaf, his strong suit.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your teenage child wants to change homes and live with your ex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifteen-year-old Logan says to his mother, “Mom, I want to live at Dad's.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His mother responds, “You don't like it here because I have rules. You just think you'll be able to do anything you want living at your father's, because he doesn't care.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“No, maybe I want to live there because you treat me like I'm a six-year-old. Dad said I could live there and that's what I'm going to do.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What if you feel that changing homes would truly not be in your kid's best interest? What do you do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What not to do</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't focus all of your efforts on trying to prevent it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In my experience, flat-out prohibition – “No, you are not going to live at your father's” – usually doesn't work. And if you and your ex-spouse end up in court, judges tend to support what teenagers say they want, unless one parent can prove that the other home is truly unfit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can try to convince your kid that it is a mistake, but that can swiftly alienate more than help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What to do</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you feel that changing homes would be a mistake for your child, by all means tell him or her what you think. But also be prepared for the fact that, despite your best efforts, your child may still go to live with his or her other parent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the life of a teenager whose parents live apart, there are many chapters in the saga that is their teenage years. Much is in flux: relationships with friends, school achievements, self-esteem, their place in the world. All of these things change. Many dramas unfold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your role in your child's life will change as well. Once they leave, they may come back … and maybe leave again. You have a very important role – very important. You want to continue to be there for them. And that is a role you must continue to inhabit, regardless of which parent they may live with at any given stage of their adolescent years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crunch time is fast approaching for the proposed free trade and investment deal between Canada and the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>. Both sides want a deal, but success means more to the Harper government than to the EU.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Negotiations have been going on for a long time. Conservative government ministers will be visiting Brussels shortly to try to settle the remaining contentious issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Negotiations are always like this: The most difficult issues are negotiated at the end. Ultimately, Prime Minister Stephen Harper will decide, as he does with just about everything inside his government. If all goes well, the deal would be announced and then crowned at a Canada-EU summit. If not, well, the consequences for Mr. Harper's trade agenda would be severe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, the Prime Minister privately exhorted a group of business leaders to get behind the EU deal. Critics have been picking apart possible items in the agreement, without much of a coherent reply either from the government or third-party groups. It's always easier for critics at this stage because they can conjure and invent, whereas defenders have to wait until a final draft is ready.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harper needs this deal for a variety of reasons. If Canada doesn't secure a deal, it is likely that the United States and Europe will start talking, leaving Canada out of the picture. Similarly, if Canada cannot finalize a deal with Europe, with which it has long-standing cultural, historical, political and economic ties, Asian countries will wonder whether Canada can only do deals with countries that have much smaller economies, such as Honduras, Chile, Panama and Colombia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The collapse of the European negotiations would send the wrong signal to China, Japan, South Korea, India and other Asian countries with which the Harper government has been angling for trade deals. Securing something in Asia is the overarching objective of the government's trade diversification strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe wants a deal, too, in part to show that it can negotiate with a mature industrial country. For Europe, a Canadian deal may eventually form part of a template for a larger deal with the United States. But since the European market is so much larger than Canada's, the Europeans have a bargaining advantage. No politician in Europe would be embarrassed if the talks fell apart, but Mr. Harper would.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the crunch issues, predictably, are tough. Europeans dislike genetically modified food, and that may obstruct access for some Canadian food products. The EU has its Common Agricultural Policy, the bane of free-traders everywhere, and Canada has its supply-managed sectors that, as usual, want to operate behind import restrictions and stratospheric tariffs. The Europeans want higher quotas; the supply-management lobby wants them maintained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, the Europeans worry about labelling, as in domestic producers here using a general name – Parma ham or names of cheeses – that Europeans want clearly identified as coming from their producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brand-name pharmaceutical companies in Canada, some of them European multinationals, want two more years of data protection after the expiration of patents. This would kick in for some, but not all, drugs in about a decade. Provinces with drug plans don't like what the Europeans want. In support of their ambitions, the brand-name industry has launched an extensive media relations campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Open bidding for public contracts is a key European demand. Naturally, this makes some Canadian provincial and municipal governments nervous, because they sometimes favour local suppliers. Ontario's local preference for the renewable energy industry was predictably ruled illegal by a <span class="companylink">World Trade Organization</span> panel. Ontario, just as predictably, is appealing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That Bombardier should win a contract to supply cars to the Paris subway is considered terrific in Canada; that some European company should win a contract for subway cars in Canada raises protectionist hackles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assuming a deal is reached, it would have to be ratified by all 27 countries in the EU. Mr. Harper has a majority in Parliament, but what opposition might the provinces create? And, of special interest, what position will the NDP adopt?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP is trying to modernize itself as the Official Opposition. The party instinctively dislikes free-trade deals and habitually votes against them. The deals, however, are the way of the globalized world. Will the NDP come to terms with free trade or remain protectionist at the core?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the B.C. Liberals' vetting team sat down with prospective candidate Mary Polak nine years ago, her reputation as a social conservative led them to some pointed questions.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Polak earned the label in her high-profile battle to keep three books depicting same-sex families out of Surrey classrooms. She was chair of the Surrey School Board, having been recruited for the job by anti-abortion campaigner Heather Stilwell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, Ms. Polak recalls how she assured the Liberals she didn't have any skeletons in her closet that might tumble out mid-campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I said, ‘I have never once made a homophobic comment – because it's not what I think.'” Her background check passed muster, and after one failed by-election race, Ms. Polak won three successive campaigns in Langley. In her time as an MLA, she has steered clear of topics that could reignite the three books controversy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Polak, who has taken an increasingly prominent role in government under Premier Christy Clark, says being in politics has changed her. Sometimes, the public spotlight can be a useful tool in developing a character, and seeing the shades between black and white.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Anybody who is in public life this long who says they haven't changed is either not very self-aware,” she said, “or they are not telling the truth.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Ms. Polak sounds less like the standard-bearer of the right, and more like a coalition-builder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We should be hard on the ideas, not on the people. I might strongly disagree with the way [NDP leader Adrian] Dix would bring about prosperity because I disagree with his methods. But you should be able to talk about ideas. And not have it become this black-and-white argument.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However a label, in politics, is not easily shed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A single mother, Ms. Polak has a daughter who works at a food bank in Vancouver. If she wanted to build a more moderate image, she has plenty of material to work with. Family anecdotes are often served up to help shape a politician's image, which is why Ms. Clark routinely works her son Hamish into her speeches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Polak has resisted that temptation. She wouldn't even provide her daughter's name in an interview this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Some are open and upfront about their kids and family. I don't know that I ever consciously made the decision to keep things private, it just wasn't me to put it out there,” Ms. Polak said. “I'm glad I did.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If anything, she might be tempted in the coming campaign to burnish her family values credentials. For the first time, she is facing a challenger coming in from the right – B.C. Conservative Party Leader John Cummins, who is running against her in Langley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she gives no sign of heading in that direction. She is almost dismissive of Mr. Cummins as a rival, saying her main focus is the B.C. New Democratic Party candidate Andrew Mercier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cummins doesn't expect to be in the riding much, anyway. He said this week he plans to be on the road conducting a leaders' tour. After finishing third in the Chilliwack-Hope by-election in the spring, the Conservatives' ability to mount a credible campaign has been in doubt. While the Liberals and NDP sent hundreds of volunteers out to get out their vote in that race, the Conservatives had about 30 workers, and little money to spend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, Mr. Cummins's party has being mired in internecine battles, further diluting their strength. “It's a huge challenge for us,” Mr. Cummins acknowledged. “People are looking and saying, ‘Who are these guys?'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Polak is likely calculating that she can afford not to be drawn into the corners by Mr. Cummins. But there is a broader, strategic reason for her to try to avoid being boxed in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals still have a large gap to close if they are to overtake the NDP and hold on to power in the May election. They have to be thinking about a game plan if they are relegated to the opposition benches. Ms. Polak, running in what is one of the safer Liberal seats in the province, could play a key role in rebuilding the party if that happens.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Did Jennifer Lawrence's unfunny monologue on Saturday Night Live, in which she pretended to diss her fellow nominees, hurt her chances for winning a best actress Oscar? Did the Weinstein Company manage to yank their Django Unchained action figures in time to avoid Oscar's wrath? Will Ben Affleck's director and best picture awards for Argo help his Oscar chances? Will the new <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> page devoted to Oscar trends predict the Academy Award results?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer to all of these questions is: Get real. The Oscars has less to do with known knowns than known unknowns, to quote the Donald Rumsfeld phrase repeated in the Oscar-contending script for Zero Dark Thirty. We have no polls of the 5,765 voting members of the <span class="companylink">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</span>, who are admonished, every year, not to talk about it. They are a large sequestered jury, a black box, the hidden faces on the other side of the one-way mirror. Yet, for several months a year, in the build-up to the Oscars, the media dutifully pretends to mind-read the membership and insist that every celebrity butterfly-wing flap sends a tremor through the Academy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we do know about the makeup of the academy: According to an L.A. Times study, they're 94-per-cent Caucasian and 77-per-cent male, with a median age of 62. And some are pretty lazy. In spite of DVD screeners and members-only screenings, some of them have to be pushed to vote at all. In a press release, AMPAS chief operating officer Ric Robertson says that one of the academy's goals is to “increase member engagement and despite some challenges, more members voted for this year's nominations than they have in the past several years.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rest is interpretation in a vacuum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take, for example the so-called shocking snubs in the directing category to Kathryn Bigelow, Ben Affleck, Tom Hooper and Quentin Tarantino, which were really just about pundits guessing wrong. The truth is, the directors' nominations stack up well: a studio veteran in uncharacteristic restraint (Steven Spielberg), an international chameleon (Ang Lee), a European master (Michael Haneke), an American maverick (David O. Russell) and an inventive first-timer (Benh Zeitlin). All of these films were more favourably reviewed in The Globe than the more conventional films by Bigelow, Tarantino, Affleck and Hooper.One explanation is that the academy's directors branch is more open to indie and foreign films than the pundits guessed. As Michael Cieply in The New York Times reports, out of 25 directors admitted to the Academy in the past three years, only one, Hairspray's Adam Shankman, has deep roots in the studio world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are a few other known knowns: The academy makes a pile of money from the Oscars (the 2009 figures showed $74-million in revenues from the show, which cost $22-million to produce). The best picture and actor nominees get a box-office bump (less than $10-million a picture, according to two different studies). Another analyst has suggested the overall cost of the studio campaigns vs. earnings probably comes out about even. But for two months, we can talk about movies that don't involve superheroes and big explosions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another known known is that host Seth MacFarlane has unveiled his first promotional short, in which he plays an annoyed guest in the hotel room next to Janet Leigh's in Psycho, a soft Billy Crystal bit of schtick. We also know that a couple of characters from MacFarlane's directorial debut, Ted, will show up: Mark Wahlberg has confirmed that he and the talking teddy bear will be on the show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also confirmed is a Fifty Years of James Bond tribute. We also know that Adele will perform the Skyfall theme song, the first time she has sung it live and her first performance since last year's Grammys. Will there also be a Les Miz medley? Unknown. The Daily Mail reported that Samantha Banks, who played Eponine, is in talks to perform on the telecast, along with her co-stars from the film.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to predicting the Oscars, you're better off studying events coming in the next week, than believing any speculation to date. From Jan. 26 through Feb. 2, look for the winners of the Producers Guild Awards (Jan. 26), the Screen Actors Guild Awards (Jan. 27) and the Directors Guild Awards (Feb. 2). The Producers Guild is a good predictor of the best picture – they've got it right the past five years in a row. The Screen Actors has only missed picking the Oscar-winning director six times in 64 years, as has the Directors Guild.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And really, deciding what is “best” among various works of art is a flawed process from the start. As John Keats, a much better poet than Donald Rumsfeld, put it “Beauty is truth, truth beauty – that is all Ye know on Earth and all ye need to know.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, in a desperate effort to derail Syria's murderous civil war, the Swiss government and 55 countries from every region of the world collectively called on <span class="companylink">the United Nations</span> Security Council to refer the crisis to the <span class="companylink">International Criminal Court</span>. After almost two years of escalating atrocities, and the repeated failure of the international community to stop the violence, the signatories to the Swiss letter hoped that a few key criminal indictments might kick-start change.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their chances of success may be minimal – Russia has already denounced the initiative as “counterproductive,” even as it delivers weapons to Syria, and China and the United States have so far remained silent – but it's worth a try. With the death toll at 60,000 and the violence worsening, there is nothing to lose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A referral is worth a try for several reasons. Allowing the gory killing of civilians to continue unabated undermines the principle of criminal accountability under international law. That's a given. But there is more. Few talk about the psychological damage inflicted when we watch atrocities happen, helpless. The killings become normalized over time, setting a dangerous political and moral precedent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A related harm is the slow marginalization of the ICC, which was created a decade ago to bring the perpetrators of the world's worst crimes to justice. The court is jeopardized when it stands by impotently in the face of crimes that fall within its jurisdiction, lacking recourse without a Security Council referral. Syria has neither signed nor ratified the ICC governing treaty, leaving the prosecutor's hands tied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A single saving option lies behind the Swiss letter: Where the perpetrators are citizens of a state that is not party to the Rome Statute, the Security Council may refer the situation to the ICC. This has already happened twice, with mixed success. In 2005, the Security Council referred the case of Darfur, resulting in an indictment of Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for genocide. (Mr. al-Bashir remains in power, although several of his colleagues are in the ICC trial pipeline.) And in 2011, the Security Council referred the case of Libya, resulting in the indictment of Moammar Gadhafi, who was never tried but was gone within a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is of interest that Chile and Libya, both countries that have experienced internal violence, are among the signatories to the Swiss petition. It is of equal interest that Canada, which effectively led the international community in the creation of the ICC, refused to sign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Council members debating the Swiss petition might consider the long-term effects of the violence we have witnessed in Syria for almost two years: the damaging normalization of atrocities and the fact that without an international move against such crimes, ruthless leaders are less likely to be deterred. They might consider that peacemaking and justice are interdependent, and that faced with this deadlock, marginalizing perpetrators through indictments may encourage negotiations. They might also think about the future of the ICC itself: Two-thirds of UN member states have signed the Rome Statute, meaning that international support for the court is high. That backing could weaken if the tribunal is seen to be failing in its mandate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until the Rome Statute is universally recognized, a Security Council referral is the only way to effect justice when major crimes are committed in a country that does not hold ICC membership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is much at stake. The Security Council must act wisely.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Wiercioch's first memory his very best friend is one of burning envy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was 9 and playing minor hockey in Burnaby, B.C.; Kyle Turris was a year older and playing for New Westminster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were facing off in an atom tournament in Vancouver. Wiercioch knew the skinny blond kid opposite was supposed to be good, but he had no idea Turris was carrying a secret weapon until he looked down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wiercioch, like every other kid on his team, was using a wooden stick. Turris was carrying one of the new two-piece sticks – composite shaft, wooden blade insert – and not only that but … “he had his name on the blade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was so jealous,” Wiercioch says with a laugh. “He had ‘Turris.' Everybody wanted their own blades with their names. This was before you could get them. I remember lining up against him on the faceoff and wondering ‘Why can't I have this?' I'm stuck here with a one piece Sherwood something-or-other.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wooden sticks became two-piece sticks became composite sticks. More than a dozen years passed and today when Kyle Turris and Patrick Wiercioch line up, it is on the same team, the <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span>, and both are early-season sensations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They could hardly be different stories. Turris, Wiercioch recalls from their years together on various teams in B.C.'s Lower Mainland, “was already turning heads.” Wiercioch not so much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turris, a centre, was an elite draft pick in 2007, selected third overall by the <span class="companylink">Phoenix Coyotes</span> after the <span class="companylink">Chicago Blackhawks</span> had taken Patrick Kane and the <span class="companylink">Philadelphia Flyers</span> had chosen James van Riemsdyk. Wiercioch, now a defenceman, went 42nd in 2008, the Senators' second pick following their selection of last year's Norris Trophy winner, Erik Karlsson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both players had graduated from the Burnaby Express juniors. Turris went from a year playing college hockey in Wisconsin straight to the NHL and last summer signed a five-year, $17.5-million (all currency U.S.) deal with the Senators. Wiercioch played two seasons at the University of Denver, then joined the Binghamton Senators, Ottawa's minor-league affiliate. They brought him up for eight games two years ago but he did not impress. He stayed in the minors all last season. He makes $875,000 if he sticks in the NHL, falls to $65,000 if he's sent back to Binghamton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, however, is unlikely to happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wiercioch knows he is fortunate to be with the big club. Injuries to Jared Cowan and Mike Lundin opened up a place on defence and he has filled it well. It will be a challenge to stick full-time, though, as the team continues to experiment with its defence prospects and Friday night in Tampa Bay elected to sit Wiercioch, despite his fine play, while they took a look at Mark Borowiecki.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Turris, beyond doubt, has been the Senators' most impressive forward, scoring three beautiful goals in the first two games and showing more speed and responsibility in his first full season with the team (even if it's not truly a full season).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They played spring and summer hockey together in B.C. They were junior teammates. They work out together, often put through the paces by Turris's father, Bruce, who is a member of the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame. They are both engaged to marry this summer and both spent most of the lockout fall training together in Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And both admit they have much to prove.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Wiercioch, it is obvious: He has to show why he should stay. He set up goals in his first two games, the second a brilliant dance across the blueline and quick pass to Turris, who ripped a one-timer into the <span class="companylink">Florida Panthers</span>' goal to launch what would become a 4-0 victory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was a very special moment,” Turris says. “That was a moment we won't forget for a very long time, to go from being 9 and 10 years old and playing together to playing together in junior in the BCHL with the Burnaby Express to be training every summer together for how many years, to be able to play not only in the NHL together but on the same team together. And to be on the power play together and connect on the power play together is just really neat.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Turris, there is nothing to prove in his abilities. He is gifted. What he has to prove is his character for, unfairly or not, he carries the baggage of a privileged young man who feels entitled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is hardly uncommon in the pampered world of gifted hockey players, but Turris had compounded the image by falling out badly with the coaches and organization in Phoenix, sitting out on his second contract and demanding a trade, which the Coyotes finally granted him 13 months ago when they traded him to Ottawa for a young prospect and a draft pick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there was his short stay this past fall in Finland, where he played 21 games for Karpat in the northern city of Oulu. Published remarks that he says made him “sick” and were a “mischaracterization” of what he said – though he did not specifically deny – showed a spoiled young man taking verbal runs at the country, its food and the rough lifestyle (travelling by bus, eating at truck stops) of professional hockey players.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turris says the trade to Ottawa was “a breath of fresh air” and that he has learned from his experiences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I can't express how thankful I am for the opportunity to be here and be an Ottawa Senator. You're always trying to prove everybody wrong. I'm especially hard on myself, too. I'm always going to be trying to prove people wrong and show that I was worthy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has no need to convince Wiercioch, his B.C. buddy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wiercioch kept in touch with Turris while the young man was going through his troubled time in Phoenix. Turris more than returned the favour when Wiercioch, playing for Binghamton, took a hard slap shot in the throat during a game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I had my injury,” Wiercioch says, “he was the first one to call my fiancée – girlfriend at the time – and make sure she was okay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And he called me before the news broke that he was traded. I was just on my way back from Boston getting my throat checked out by a specialist there and preparing myself for the worst. You know, what's the X-ray going to read? What's going to happen?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He called me and that was the best news of the day. I didn't really care what happened that day, just that he was going to be here and hopefully one day we'd be here.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now they are – both with a great deal still to prove.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I always thought I'd gain knowledge as I got older; instead, it seems to be leaking away. I know almost nothing for certain, except that the only book you really need is Keith Richards's autobiography Life, since it contains a breakfast recipe and rules for surviving a knife fight. I've also discovered the hard way that you can't survive on Twizzlers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But one thing I definitely know – I'd put all my money on this at the roulette table – is that there isn't a parent on Earth who chooses to take a stroller on a bus at rush hour for the sheer joy of it. No mother has ever woken up and said, “I know! I've got nothing better to do today, so I'm going to take this unmanageable barge and its screaming barnacle, ram it up the Niagara Falls of the bus steps, steer it around the shoals of fuming fellow passengers and crush a few toes in the process. What japes! It'll be better than a Jell-O party at George Clooney's house.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might think, from the tone of the debate over strollers on public transit currently raging in Toronto and elsewhere, that this is exactly what parents do. The <span class="companylink">Toronto Transit Commission</span> is going to look into the issue, after a commuter complained at a public meeting about the crush of prams on buses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As well, earlier this month, a Toronto mother claimed that a bus driver made disparaging remarks about her taking her child on the bus, and suggested, not entirely politely, that she get a smaller stroller and perhaps not travel at rush hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There can be few issues more inflammatory to the squashed urban hordes. Even those who have not seen the inside of a bus since Methuselah was in diapers have an opinion: Those contraptions are too big! You should just fold the damn thing and carry the baby – and your purse, and your shopping, and your briefcase, and the angry five-year-old who's decided to sit and cry in the middle of the aisle. (This might actually be possible if you're an octopus in the employ of <span class="companylink">Cirque du Soleil</span>, or if you travel with an army of litter-bearers.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I take public transit in Toronto every day. I took it when I lived in London, and my tiny daughter was riding in a cheap little pushchair, and I would jockey with five other women for the three spots in the buggy bay. That aggressive city, where people are often a crisp's-breadth from a punch-up, struggles to this day with the issue of strollers on buses. A couple of years ago, a mother with a pushchair was severely beaten on a London bus by another parent in a fight over stroller space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I can tell you with a fair degree of certainty that the parents with small children you see on the bus are not there because they want to be, or because making your life miserable is the goal of their day, but because they have no choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm all for baby-free spaces, by the way. Child-free hotels and child-free restaurants are a great idea, and I wish I could visit them more often. When <span class="companylink">Air Asia</span> announced it was introducing baby-free zones on its planes, I applauded. On a flight, I don't want to sit next to a drooling creature that has no control over its limbs and is permanently attached to a bottle. But I don't want to sit next to a baby, either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those spaces are a matter of choice. Buses often aren't. The issue is also broader, and more pressing: As we increasingly choose to live in the heart of the city, we have to make some concessions in order to reap the great joys of urban life. Learning to live together in small spaces is Houdini's work: Our park, my dog. Our sidewalk, my cigarette. Our bus, my stroller. But at the very moment we're required to be more tolerant, we're losing all capacity to be inconvenienced, even for a moment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's worth thinking about, the next time you see a woman with a stroller on the bus first thing in the morning, or after work. You may wish she weren't there, but you can bet she's wishing the same thing, twice as hard. She might not have a car, or her partner took the car. She might not have a partner. (All of this applies equally to stroller-pushing dads, obviously.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there are five bags hanging off the handles of her buggy, and possibly another small child, it's because she doesn't have a trunk. Or a Sherpa. So smile and offer a hand. We all start out in strollers and end up in mobility scooters; during the happy time in between, we can afford to be a bit generous.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a novelty, Dark Table still manages to thrill. And as a restaurant, the hospitality is genuinely impressive. It's too bad the food isn't remotely close to “rivalling some of Vancouver's best restaurants,” as boasted on the website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are greeted by a sighted hostess, perched under a heat lamp wearing a parka. She presents us with a menu and asks us to choose from a two or three-course dinner. The appetizer and dessert options are allegedly “surprises” – unless you've visited before. Save for dessert, the menu didn't change at all from December to January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Saturday night (when there are only two seatings), we have to wait outside while the early setting is cleared. As you can imagine, the tables and floor get quite messy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under a sheltered patio, we huddle beside fellow diners (mostly young), clutching bottles of sparkling cava and cheap wine. Dark Table is a BYOB restaurant, which is not advertised on its website. For now, there is no corkage fee, although that may change in the near future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ambience is nervously giddy, with everyone smiling at each other in hushed anticipation. It feels as if we're in the lineup for a roller coaster – or a haunted house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Group by group, we are introduced to our servers. The first night it was Lazare, an amateur singer and social worker from Togo who has no previous experience waiting tables. Tonight, we're in the hands of a gregarious gal named Amy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You're not blind!” we exclaim, watching her eyes dart behind aviator sunglasses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No, she's not totally blind, She has 30 per cent sight. (“It's like swimming underwater without goggles,” she explains.) Which is a lot more than we can see as we form a train with our hands placed on the shoulder in front of us and choo-choo our way through the front foyer, between a thick curtain and over to our table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The restaurant has no stairs, but it feels as if we're descending. Amy puts my hand on the back of my chair, waits until I'm seated, describes everything on the table and encourages us to fondle our cutlery as we orient ourselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It takes a special type of person to do this job. Yes, they have to be legally blind. But they also have to have a gentle touch, a sense of humour, a commanding voice, the nimbleness not to knock customers in the head and the graciousness to baby needy patrons while juggling a four-table section.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Careful. Careful. Careful.” We hear the monotonous refrain over and over as the servers escort their customers to the washroom. (Yes, they're lit inside.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time the first course arrives, it feels like the restaurant has gotten even darker. We can hear voices from the next table, but it's all discombobulated. I can't comprehend a single word.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Can you put your hands out?” Amy asks as she passes me my plate. So far, so good. I haven't spilled any water or knocked anything to the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But eating with cutlery feels like a grown-up game of pin the tail on the donkey. For every five stabs, I get one mouthful of food.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The salad consists of kale (firm), roasted red peppers (slimy) and mushrooms (smoky).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Mmm, Parmesan,” my dining companion notes out loud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What? Has blindness destroyed my palate? I don't taste any Parmesan. I take Amy's advice and start digging with my fingers. Can you imagine if blind people acted like such barbarians in public?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're not freaked out (according to general manager Sami Mousattat, about one customer a week develops a previously undiagnosed case of claustrophobia and bolts out before dinner), dark dining can actually be quite romantic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Toronto and Montreal, Valentine's Day is the busiest night. There are lots of proposals. (“Hope it's not because the guys are buying their fiancées small diamonds,” Amy cracks.) And a fair share of disrobing. It's no wonder this voyeuristic experience attracts surreptitious exhibitionists. Unless the server brushes up against a bare breast, who would know?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a culinary experience, however, Dark Table has much to be desired. The kitchen staff, led by chef Kristina Walgenbach, are not blind and do not cook in the dark – but they might as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the schnitzel is nicely crisped and the garlic prawns are decently firm, the peppercorn sauce on the beef tenderloin is cold and the gnocchi in creamy jalepeno sauce is gummy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The food is good enough for a novelty restaurant. And I don't suppose the menu is the main draw. But it's true that when you can't see, your other senses are heightened. This would be a much better experience if it didn't taste so overwhelmingly bland.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward Keenan did a lot of things before he started writing about politics and life in Toronto. He worked in a chemical factory. He worked as a cook. He cut the grass on the side of the highway. He sold shoes. He opened a restaurant, and lost his shirt. He was a carnival barker at the Canadian National Exhibition. Now, at age 39, he is a columnist at The Grid, a city weekly. His new book, Some Great Idea: Good Neighbourhoods, Crazy Politics and the Invention of Toronto, looks at the evolution of the city since amalgamation.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We both cover city hall. How do you find it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It sure beats working for a living. No, but I've had a lot less fun in jobs. There is great material every day. The characters are riveting to write about. I think you said it was the best political reporting gig in the country right now, and I think I agree with you about that. But as a citizen, I find it frustrating and depressing sometimes, when the clown show takes over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So: bad for the city, good for you and me?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yeah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What do you think of the court decision granting Mr.Ford's appeal?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Politically, to his opponents, this is perhaps a gift to them even if it doesn't look like it right now. All sides were going to be facing a chaotic situation. This is probably a healthier decision for the city politically and in the long run, even if it means another two years of bitter infighting and probably more sideshows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will this experience change Rob Ford?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is not much I see from my time watching Rob Ford to show he can learn something, but there is always room for hope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Benjamin Disraeli talked about every great city having a great idea. What is Toronto's?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto's great idea is summed up in its motto: diversity is our strength. Not just meaning multiculturalism, but economic diversity and mixed-use buildings on the street, the things Jane Jacobs talked about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If diversity is our strength, why has it left us so divided?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We can get caught up in a buzzword like diversity and misunderstand it to mean that it is like perfect harmony. Diversity is our strength because it allows differences to coexist, but at times that can lead to conflict and be very messy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In what ways?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There doesn't even seem to be a lot of ground for debate. Rob Ford and his fiercest opponents don't even accept the same premises. Where somebody like John Tory and David Miller seemed to have a fairly vibrant debate about the city's finances, somebody like Rob Ford and somebody like [left-leaning city councillor] Gord Perks can't even agree on the meaning of words or the colour of the sky. So we wind up with a completely disjointed understanding of what Toronto is all about or where it is going and what its problems are, based on a sort of mutual blindness, mutual ignorance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How do you see our recent mayors?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mel Lastman was a big salesman. He really represented the old establishment of the city: the Metro backroom boys, the provincial-government fixers. He was their guy. And then David Miller was an uprising against that. He was celebrated by the people in the city who were growing in affluence but who were feeling shut out in Mel Lastman's city hall, a kind of a new creative-class establishment. And then I think Rob Ford represents people who felt left out of David Miller's city hall, people who live in neighbourhoods where incomes have been going down for a generation, and where life is getting harder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are we a dysfunctional family, a broken marriage? Should the suburbs and the downtown just get divorced and de-amalgamate?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't think so. We have a lot of dysfunction, but I think we are still doing all right as a family. Divorce or de-amalgamation would be more destructive than helpful at this point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we should embrace the chaos?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What are your views on Rob Ford? You are surprisingly sympathetic in the book.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I still think Rob Ford has good intentions. Most of the problems that I see with him – and there are many, obviously – result from his genuine lack of understanding of the bigger picture. That's probably a condescending kind of empathy but it is the best I have. His convictions are genuinely held.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You say in your book he has a gift for retail politics. What sort of gift?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He feels for people. He wants to listen to exactly what their problems are and he wants to help them solve them. He visits people when they have too many cockroaches or are concerned about where the crossing guard is in their neighbourhood. And that engendered a lot of loyalty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where did he go wrong?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the unfulfillable promise of Rob Ford was he said we'd cut the budget but he also promised that better customer service would be the result. He hasn't been able to do that and it wasn't reasonable to expect anyone could. He got into these very public battles with city council and he was unable to do the work involved in finding a majority that will allow you to govern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is he dumb? A lot of people think he is just dumb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a simple-mindedness combined with a stubbornness there that has really handicapped him. He is not a sophisticated thinker and he is not book smart in any sense. He is smart in other ways. He is able to communicate with people who are alienated from the process and tap into that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it true, as you say in the book, that you have been punched in the face in several different parts of Toronto?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yeah, by complete strangers, actually. I used to drink a lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite being punched in the face a lot, do you have good feelings about the city?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I love the city. Everything I would want in a city is here.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rob Ford is still Mayor of Toronto, at least until the next self-made catastrophe. He needs to ensure City Hall isn't a sideshow any more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The court ruling that allowed him to remain mayor is good for the city. He was elected mayor two years ago because voters liked his ideas about reining in municipal spending. The $7-million or so to be spent on a by-election if he had suffered the mandatory (and in our view excessive) penalty of being thrown off council would have been too much. Faction-driven attempts to appoint a caretaker mayor until the next election two years hence would have been yet another distraction. Toronto is desperately in need of stable leadership.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some are describing Rob Ford's court win as a victory for democracy. If so, democracy won on a technicality – a three-judge panel ruled that the city never had the right to demand he pay back the $3,150 he improperly solicited from business people for his football charity. On principle, the city that voted him in had a right to expect he would follow conflict-of-interest laws – laws passed democratically – and not participate in votes in which he had a direct financial interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto doesn't need controversies about why Mr. Ford insists on reading while driving on an expressway to work, or swearing at a 911 operator or trying to bend the bureaucracy to fix the roads and grounds around his family business. It doesn't need a mayor who is on the football field (praiseworthy though his volunteer coaching is) when council is debating an $8-billion transit plan. It needs a full-time mayor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three budgets passed on Mr. Ford's watch have done much to restore confidence in the city's finances. Whether he still has the credibility with the public and his fellow council members to be an effective leader remains to be seen. He and council need to put this episode behind them and get down to business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barring a successful appeal by the citizen who challenged him over the conflict of interest, Mr. Ford has a renewed chance to lead the city, and to remind voters why they chose him.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until this week, I've never felt a divide between the world I grew up in and the world in which my children live.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, my children have never known a time when you stood weekly in a bank line – quiet and roped, like a pew at church – alongside your mother, wearing nude hose and something you'd watched her iron, while she waited for her turn to conduct sombre business with a clerk in a tie who addressed her as “Mrs … .”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet they would not be complete strangers there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I did once take my children in with me to a bank I'd scouted in Antigua, Guatemala, as one would take them to a re-enactment of some kind – to witness a financial nativity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank was made of marble; the tellers were protected from unsophisticated threats by polished brass bars. Nothing was advertised on the walls in puns and primary colours. It was as if there were no money changers there, and I wanted my children to see it once.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They went quiet, looked at the money I withdrew differently from the way they looked at the money spat out with an urgent beep before the scrumpling and tossing of the receipt, which completes the gesture, as my ballet teacher used to say in reference to some endlessly repeated movement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My children have grown up on the road from bank machines to debit: A bank note seems an almost archivable document now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've told them how thrilling it was for my brothers and me when, once a year, The Wizard of Oz came on television; I'd get very excited when the NBC peacock announced that tonight's program would be brought to us in colour. My parents – who for most of my childhood either had no television or did all they could to make whatever sad foster television was in their temporary care as uninteresting to us as possible – would explain to me, once again, that this was the case only if you had a colour TV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We didn't, because they were a waste of money, and what we had was fine, just don't lose the pliers that turn the knob again, and don't you have a book you could be reading?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, despite the gap between my world and the one my high-definition-Netflix-watching, debit-card-using children live in, the moment I felt made me of another era only occurred when President Barack Obama spoke of gay rights during his inaugural address.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As shifts go, it made the advent of the Internet seem incremental.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths – that all of us are created equal – is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma, and Stonewall,” Mr. Obama said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law, for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing I've seen occur in my lifetime would have been impossible for my young, beginning-to-end-black-and-white-Wizard-of-Oz-watching self to imagine, except that moment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as there were only 66 years between the Wright brothers' first powered flight and the moon landing, there were only 43 years (none of them easy) between the Stonewall riots and this declaration. I wouldn't have thought it possible even four years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It stunned me, even on the heels of the repeal of “don't ask, don't tell,” even after Mr. Obama had declared his support for same-sex marriage, even after – in a little-reported moment I think would, not long ago, have lost an election – Vice-President Joe Biden referred to discrimination against transgendered people as “the civil-rights issue of our time.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This wasn't a speech made in a super-sassy gay club on Rainbow Avenue before a predominantly gay audience, nor the excellent speech Mr. Obama gave at the White House reception marking LGBT Pride Month in June of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, Mr. Obama, by the breadth of his audience, preached to the unconverted. Short of standing there wearing a Sylvester shirt while belting out (if such a thing can be done) a Pet Shop Boys song, he could not have aligned himself more closely with the LGBT community than he did while being sworn in for his second term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By equating the Stonewall riots, a spontaneous act of civil disobedience, with the historic 1848 women's-rights conference in Seneca Falls and the freedom marches of the civil-rights movement, Mr. Obama didn't merely denounce discrimination against LGBT people, which of course would have been a first in an inaugural speech.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, he made pleas for “tolerance” or “compassion” toward LGBT people feel anachronistic. They simply are. They are simply owed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world is different. It's the moment the film changes to colour.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Weir's six-under-par 66 in the opening round Thursday of the <span class="companylink">Farmers Insurance</span> Open in La Jolla, Calif., was the product not only of a hot putter and improved ball-striking, but of a refined mental state.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weir followed on Friday with a three-over 75, allowing him to make the cut at a PGA event for the first time since the 2011 <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span> National, snapping a dry spell of 17 tournaments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an unusual move for a private person who rarely speaks publicly about the details of what he's working on, Weir thanked “Graham and Henry from FocusBand” in an interview with the Golf Channel after the opening round.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's it all about?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Graham and Henry Boulton are a father-and-son team from Windaroo, Queensland, Australia. FocusBand is a device that an athlete wears on his head to measure electrical impulses in the brain while providing information on his mental state. The information is transmitted wirelessly to a computer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea is based on extensive research that the Boultons provide on their website. The website links to one study called Quiet Eye Duration, Expertise, and Task Complexity in Near and Far Aiming Exercises, a collaborative effort that three scientists conducted with billiards players. Skilled players kept their eyes fixed on the target longer than lesser players before they started to move the billiard cue. They were more focused, the result of quiet rather than twitchy eyes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a lot more to the Boultons' work than that one paragraph can indicate. The objective is to help the athlete get into that zone where, in golf at any rate, he is swinging rather than thinking. The intention is to engage the right rather than the left brain – the imaginative and instinctive part of the brain rather than the logical side. Golfers have heard for years that “You can't think and swing at the same time.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's more than a hint of Zen in this, and, as it turns out, the approach is meant to generate what is called a “Mushin” state. One definition said that Mushin “is the progressive experience of deepening levels of no conscious mindedness,” and the Boultons' website claims that FocusBand is “built on revolutionary Asian scientific discoveries.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weir is featured on the home page of the website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Golf at Weir's level is a tricky business. He's been working with his usual dedication on rebuilding his swing under the guidance of Grant Waite, a former PGA Tour player who won once. Weir has shot four rounds in the 60s this season, and he's played only eight rounds. He was nine-under-par for 13 holes in the third round of last week's Humana Challenge in La Quinta, Calif., before making a bogey and then triple-bogeying the last hole when he was right on the cut line. The cut came after three rounds at the Humana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A golfer doesn't go nine-under for 13 holes without swinging well. That's the mechanics part, even though something broke down on the 18th hole when Weir needed to make a good swing to make the cut. He drove into the water, and that was effectively that. Maybe he wasn't in his comfort zone at that moment. After all, just making the cut would have been an accomplishment. That can sound weird when we're talking about a golfer who has won a Masters and seven other PGA Tour events. But golf can be brutal and it can wreak havoc on a player's swing and mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday on the more difficult South Course at Torrey Pines, he made bogey on three of the last five holes to drop well down the leaderboard toward the cut line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weir has settled on Waite for his swing, after flitting from instructor to instructor. And he seems to have settled on the Boultons and FocusBand for turning off his rational side and turning on his intuitive side on the course. That's not easy for any golfer, especially somebody like Weir who has had to rebuild a swing after a serious elbow injury that required surgery. If the mechanics of his swing are improving, and it appears that's the case, then it will be all that more important for Weir to believe in it, to have a quiet mind, and, I suppose, the quiet eye that goes with it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are not your father's <span class="companylink">Edmonton Oilers</span>, this swashbuckling young team, and for proof, consider the father of Thursday night's scoring hero, Sam Gagner. Gagner was 7 the year his dad, Dave, played for the Flames. Dave Gagner was Jarome Iginla's first centre in Iginla's rookie season and helped him find his way in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The younger Gagner has a picture of himself, as a boy, posing with Iginla at the Saddledome – and went on the ice there, the way children of <span class="companylink">NHL</span> players do, after practice at Christmas, during school breaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Oilers of 2012-13 are steeped in the tradition of the Battle of Alberta, which, after a few less than enthralling years, resumes Saturday in Calgary with a new, clearer focus. It is Edmonton's youth and promise against Calgary's veteran uncertainty. The Oilers feature Taylor Hall, who lived in Calgary until the age of 12 before the family moved to Kingston. There is Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, who played his junior hockey in Red Deer, the city perched right in the middle of the two cities, where some fans look north for their <span class="companylink">NHL</span> fix and some glance south.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Battle of Alberta has been like that for years, curious threads to tug on for both sides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Oilers haven't had a lot of homegrown talent of late, but that changed in the first week when the Oilers acquired Mark Fistric, a hard-hitting defenceman, from the <span class="companylink">Dallas Stars</span>. Fistric demonstrated what he will add to the mix with a crushing, old-fashioned, open-ice bodycheck against the <span class="companylink">Los Angeles Kings</span>' Jordan Nolan in Thursday night's controversial and entertaining 2-1 overtime win over the defending Stanley Cup champions. He should be right at home when hostilities resume Saturday night in Calgary, on a game that will be featured on Hockey Night in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of the newest Oilers, Nail Yakupov and Justin Schultz, will be making their Battle of Alberta debuts, and Gagner knows there'll be a conversation before puck drop about what it all means.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think that's something you try to prepare for, but it's hard to,” Gagner said. “Once the game starts, you realize the intensity of it and everything that comes from playing in the Battle of Alberta. It's a tough test.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Oilers had an interesting first week, starting with last Sunday night's road win over the <span class="companylink">Vancouver Canucks</span>. They came home for the season opener against the <span class="companylink">San Jose Sharks</span> and laid an egg in the first 20 minutes – down 6-1 in a game they lost 6-3. Forty-eight hours later, the Kings came to town and it is hard to imagine any game this season being any stranger than that. Virtually every obscure penalty in the rulebook was called. The power plays were abysmal. L.A. nursed a 1-0 lead into the 58th minute when Nugent-Hopkins appeared to tie the game, only to have the goal waved off because Gagner was allegedly in the crease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oilers fans pelted the ice with debris in disgust. But with 4.7 seconds remaining in regulation, Yakupov tied the game, and celebrated in Theo Fleury style, a knees-first slide down the ice, with the fans on their feet, cheering loudly. In overtime, the Kings took another penalty – for too many men on the ice – and Gagner made them pay, sneaking in from the right point to the left post to score the winner against goalie Jonathan Quick. It was an extraordinary finish to a quirky game, but in a lot of ways, the method – as much as the result – could be just what the Oilers need to coalesce as a team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yakupov has a pleasing cockiness to him and his celebration earned mixed reviews on social media. Some loved it. Others thought it was presumptuous for someone playing in just his third <span class="companylink">NHL</span> game. But enthusiasm is something in short supply in today's buttoned-down <span class="companylink">NHL</span>, and for better or worse, Yakupov's giddiness made it on all the highlight shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gagner suggested he might have done the same when he scored, except that he'd been tackled by Justin Schultz. At this stage in their development, the Oilers are a team “continually learning more and more about ourselves,” Gagner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was a short training camp, but that's all we talked about – having that winner's mentality. There's going to be adversity, it's just how you handle it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could a come-from-behind victory over the defending champions be a turning point for the young Oilers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are defining moments in every season,” Gagner said, “defining who you are as a team, and we're hoping this is one of those moments. The biggest thing for us is, we have so many games here, that it's a matter of bottling that feeling and moving on. It's so important just to focus on your next task and that's what we're going to do.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next task: Calgary on a Saturday night. Let the hostilities resume.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, Mr. Orr suffered a serious concussion during a fight, and missed the rest of that season, and even part of last season. How many other concussions he has had is not known. It was taken for granted that fighters don't need a concussion protocol.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His first fight of the new season – the 252nd of his career, including junior, according to hockeyfights.com – illustrated the dangers of his situation. He found himself up against a new breed of hockey superheavyweight, John Scott of Buffalo, 6'8'' and 270 pounds. Mr. Orr may be 6'3'' and 222 pounds, but his brain is no more damage-proof than that of the proverbial 98-pound weakling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was in game 2. In game 3, Mr. Orr fought Deryk Engelland of Pittsburgh, who in 2010 felled him with a clean blow to the jaw. Once again, Mr. Orr absorbed several direct blows to the head. “His head snapped back like a Pez dispenser,” the Pittsburgh announcer cried.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some say it should be Mr. Orr's choice; after all, he is earning roughly $1-million a season. But each time he fights, he makes the fans complicit in the risks to his health. They can't help but cheer, and by cheering, they become participants in what we may one day look back on as a tragedy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then we will ask – why was he permitted, after all those fights and such a serious concussion, to continue playing? Why did no one intervene to protect him?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone knows the risks to hockey's designated fighters, especially those who, like Mr. Orr, have fought as many as 36 times in one pro season. The excuse of ignorance is gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We know about the painful decline of retired athletes with chronic traumatic encephalopathy. We know that hockey fighters Reg Fleming and Bob Probert suffered from CTE, a degenerative disease linked to depression, preventable dementia and suicide. Mr. Fleming and Mr. Probert were not Pez dispensers. They had families who loved them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We can't be sure that hockey's full-time fighters will develop CTE, but we know they're at great risk. Should responsible hockey franchises allow them to continue after years and years of absorbing bare-knuckled blows? Money can't buy a cure for what they are at risk of. Should the choice be theirs?</p>

Ms. Koorbatoffs noticed recently during a meeting at work that wearing a nametag made people in the room more likely to talk to each other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She calls her initiative “Say Hi Vancouver!” and on Feb. 8, she would like us all to wear nametags and introduce ourselves to strangers – people whose paths you may cross regularly, but still, strangers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has created a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page to promote the event. It reads as follows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Say Hi Vancouver is a simple idea. Wear a name tag and say hello! Why? We see the same people everyday … in the coffee shop, on transit, at work, even in our own neighbourhoods … and we have little or no connection to most of them. We live our lives beside each other, an invisible barrier separating us – subtle yet powerful. A simple name tag can break through this barrier, giving permission to Say Hi! Even if for just one day it will be worth it! We'll never see those people the same way again … suddenly they become someone we can say hello to, name tag or not. Imagine the possibilities!!!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yeah, I can imagine the possibilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a reason people don't talk to each other on transit, in elevators, jail cells, or anywhere else where they are being held in close quarters against their will: You just don't. It's uncivilized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be honest, if someone came up to you on the SkyTrain, made eye contact and said, “Hi, my name is Dave, what's yours?,” what would your first reaction be? Me, I would assume Dave wanted money, and I would avert my gaze. Does that make me a bad person? No, it's just practical. It eliminates the need for conversation, or for me to have to listen to Dave's hard-luck story. It slams the door shut, where the door ought to be. Plus, it saves time. Dave can move on to the next person and I can continue staring into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Dave then pointed to his name tag and said, “No, you misunderstand, I'm just being friendly! See?!” I would switch trains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I know, in the past I've written about all of the things we could do as a citizens to be better to each other, to reach out to newcomers, to be more welcoming in our communities, but I draw the line at talking to strangers just because they happen to be wearing name tags; because it's a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making it an official day makes it even more Seinfeldian. (Who does not want to wear the ribbon?!) The expectation that I'm going to do something because someone has set aside a day for it frankly makes me angry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if you go down that path of just talking to anyone, where does it end? I mean, what's next? Sit in the front seat of a cab day? Wave to the person who let you into traffic week? French kiss your Barista month can't be far behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you feel some irrepressible need to have a conversation with someone you've never met, do the proper thing and do it on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> or <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>. Or in the comments section of your favourite on-line publication, where meaningful dialogue and well-considered conversations rule the day. There, you'll have the freedom to say whatever you want while enjoying the protection of your ill-considered user name or lame alias, with no one breathing on you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But talking to someone you've never met, face to face?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'd rather wear a puffy shirt.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Journalism, especially in print, has had an honoured position for centuries. Writing about the elite business and political leaders, often with great influence and impact on society, gave people in the news business their own sense of superiority. In the late 18th century, it was said that after the three official “estates” in the <span class="companylink">British Parliament</span> (clergy, lords and Commons), the news media were “the fourth estate.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in recent years, online media, social media and more open debates have made journalism more democratic and more accountable. That old superiority has been shaken and has made the media more attuned to the readers and less likely to try to rule from on high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's media, including The Globe and Mail, want to have a conversation with readers. We reach out for their views on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and other online venues, and pay attention to what they want to know. The Globe, for example, provides a “report an error” link at the top of every story encouraging readers to point out problems quickly, before they're repeated in print.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I see my job as Public Editor as more than just correcting errors. A large part of it is listening to what readers think is wrong or unfair and being an advocate for those who want the coverage to be better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Journalists must be unafraid to hold leaders to account, but they also represent the public, so they should use language and descriptions respectfully.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, several readers wrote to complain about a casual comment in a column about living alone that said the only people who don't yearn for long-term intimate connections are “in some way autistic, or asexual.” It was not meant to be hurtful, but writers sometimes forget they can be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, a photo cutline called a 23-year-old Indian rape victim a girl. Women are not girls in their late teens and beyond. The Globe was called out on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> over that mistake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other side of the age issue, I have complained before about stories that contrast “young professionals” and “aging baby boomers” especially in stories about the working world or real estate. Can baby boomers not be professionals? Aren't the young also aging?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there is the word “elderly.” A couple who were killed earlier this month – she was 66 and he was 71 – were described as elderly by another news organization. A Globe and Mail story described another woman, age 68, as elderly. The term suggests someone very old and frail and can be offensive to people in their 60s and 70s. Would anyone call Hillary Clinton or Judi Dench elderly? A better term would be seniors or, if accurate, retirees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there have been many great advances in being more respectful and democratic, and there were days when it was much worse. Funnily enough, a reader recently raised a question of punctuation that exposed a very old example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked why The Globe and Mail uses Ms. with a period, when it is not a contraction, Warren Clements, the former editor of the paper's internal Style Book, said: “We wrestled with that question at the start, and reached the conclusion that Ms. is indeed a contraction – an omnibus contraction of Missus and Miss. A side benefit of using the period is that it didn't look odd in sentences that included ‘Mr.,' ‘Dr.,' etc.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the question was also a reminder of the great reluctance on the part of The Globe to employ Ms. as a title in the 1970s, when it was new, even though it was being used by a number of prominent women. It's embarrassing today to read this from the 1976 Style Book: “The use of Ms. will continue to be barred except in stories about the use of this form of address.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It specified that Maureen McTeer, the wife of then opposition leader Joe Clark, should be referred to as Miss McTeer on second reference – even though Maureen McTeer, like many other women at the time, called herself Ms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was at that point, or a little after, that I and many other women and men in the newsroom signed a petition asking the senior editors to allow Ms. – not just because it was clearly being used, but because people deserved to be called what they wanted to be. To refuse was more than failing to see that society was changing; it was paternalistic for a newspaper to decide what a woman should be called.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon after that, the newspaper started informally allowing Ms. for any woman who preferred it. It wasn't until 1990 (when Mr. Clements started working on the Style Book) that it became the default honorific in the paper for all women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Clements put it: “Ah, the slow march of history.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">History is not marching quite as slowly today, thanks to readers and bloggers and Tweeters. And that is a good thing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘I think it's a bit unfair that I have to be multicultural, while you get to be whatever you want to be.” That was said to me a few days ago, with an ironic smile and no trace of anger, by a young, dark-skinned woman in a hijab who spoke with a more pronounced Canadian accent than mine.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I mention this not because her words surprised me, but because they have become so familiar. Over the past couple of years, when I have found myself hearing sharp criticism of multiculturalism in this country, it is very often coming from a Canadian-born child of religious-minority immigrants. “Multiculturalism was fine for my parents' generation,” a Bangladeshi-Canadian radio producer told me, “but I have no use for it – it just makes me feel like a second-class Canadian.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The generation born after the M-word entered the Canadian vocabulary – the putative beneficiary of it – appears to find the concept obsolete. There don't appear to be any data on this, but ask around: Those who are the most “multicultural” often like the word the least.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How can this be, when Canada is just about the only country where the M-word is almost universally popular? Surveys taken over the past decade show that as many as 85 per cent of Canadians believe multiculturalism is good for the country. While leaders in Germany, Britain and France have gained political traction by blasting “multi-kulti,” in Canada there is no major political party, left or right, that opposes the concept.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why mess with a good thing, then? You have to understand the distinction. When people like me – a sixth-generation Anglo-Canadian – hear people criticizing multiculturalism, we think they're attacking the “multi” part. A good part of those unhappy 15 per cent would probably prefer the old Canada of British and French immigrants and natives. Add to that a few who don't care for darker skin colours and some who harbour a dark distrust of religious minorities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what bothers these children of immigrants is the second half of the word – not the “multi,” but the “culturalism.” They have no problem with ethnic, racial, religious or linguistic diversity – just not as defined, from the outside, by the neat categories preferred by people like me and by the government policies that enforce these categories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This distinction is made sharply by British scholar Kenan Malik, who is part of a wave of British and European figures on the “ethnic” centre-left (he is of Indian-Muslim descent) who are outspokenly opposed to multiculturalism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his Milton K. Wong lecture in Vancouver last year, he identified the two chief ways we understand the word multiculturalism. The first is what he calls “the lived experience of diversity.” That's how I enjoy multiculturalism – the Eritrean guy across my street who makes good coffee, the bowl of pork bone soup down the street in Koreatown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second he calls “multiculturalism as a political process, the aim of which is to manage that diversity.” For immigrants, and especially their children, this is the face of multiculturalism – not an experience, but something that is done to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is, to quote Mr. Malik, “a set of policies, the aim of which is to manage and institutionalize diversity by putting people into ethnic and cultural boxes, defining individual needs and rights by virtue of the boxes into which people are put, and using those boxes to shape public policy.” The policies have created “communities,” united by associations and generally self-appointed leaders, often through the temple or the mosque.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It only looks diverse from the outside. Inside those “communities,” it is more like what economist Amartya Sen calls “plural monoculturalism” – a diversity of isolated islands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How would I respond if I were subject to such policies? Imagine the creation of a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant policy, with celebrations organized by the WASP Council of Canada – whose leaders were typically older men from the Church of England – and everything I read about me was written through the lens of such councils and their spokespeople. Yes, it does sound like Toronto in the 1950s. I'm also certain I would rebel against it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the post-immigrant shift: For the first generation, multiculturalism was a way to feel part of the national whole; for the second, it often feels like a barrier to such inclusion. For this new, comfortably inclusive Canada, we need a new vocabulary: More “multi,” less “culturalism.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Casino applications rarely end well. There are always people who don't want a gambling joint in their community. The final decision, whichever way it goes, invariably leads to hard feelings that can linger for years.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The politics that surround these gambling projects can often be ugly, too, and lead to bitter recriminations that can have long-term consequences. And for the latest example of this, we direct you to the fallout from Surrey council's recent move to reject a proposed $100-million casino development for its city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is almost no one who has come out looking good in this one, except perhaps for the citizens who led the charge to have the application thwarted. Whether you agree with their viewpoint or not, at least they acted honourably and with integrity. Unfortunately the same can't be said for others, starting with Liberal cabinet minister Rich Coleman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, it was revealed that a couple of days before the Jan. 19 vote on the matter, Mr. Coleman, the minister in charge of gambling in the province, phoned a couple of Surrey councillors with a not-so-subtle warning: If the city voted the casino down, it would be the last chance they'd get for one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Surrey Mayor Dianne Watts cast the deciding vote against the development, Mr. Coleman was furious. He publicly reiterated the threats that he'd made privately to the councillors; this was it for Surrey. The province and the BCLC (<span class="companylink">British Columbia Lottery Corporation</span>) would never deal with it again when it came to casino applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the lottery corporation president, Michael Graydon, couldn't contain his resentment. He chastised the mayor for casting the vote that killed the project when she had never previously raised any objections to it. Or so he said. He accused the city of being difficult to deal with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard to say whose conduct was more egregious: Mr. Coleman's or the lottery corporation president's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rich Coleman had no business trying to influence anyone's vote with a take-it-or-leave-it threat. This was a matter for the city of Surrey and its residents to decide. There was an approval protocol in place. As Ms. Watts rightly pointed out this week: “Why even have a process and engage the public on a gaming license if your expectation is that it should go through regardless?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even some of Mr. Coleman's Liberal caucus colleagues were affronted by his behaviour. Surrey-White Rock MLA Gordie Hogg called it completely “inappropriate.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That Mr. Coleman's actions haven't been censured in any way does not reflect well on the leadership in this province. Premier Christy Clark certainly can't abide by this type of behaviour, no matter how much she may like her cabinet minister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond that, Mr. Coleman's threat and subsequent tantrum at the result does not speak well of the philosophical outlook of the Liberal party overall. It's the type of behaviour that implies that the will of the people is meaningless and should be disregarded at the expense of the almighty dollar. Surely, this can't be the kind of message a political party wants to be communicating in advance of a provincial election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Premier would be wise to clarify where she and her government stand on such matters. She should also call off the jihad Mr. Coleman seems to have declared on Surrey. There shouldn't be any type of lifetime casino ban on the city. That's ridiculous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wouldn't be a bad idea if Ms. Clark also clarified the role of the lottery corporation. I think most of us believe it is a regulator. That it oversees gambling in the province and as such should not be actively involved in promoting individual casino applications as it did in this case. That is the proponent's job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Graydon is a civil servant and he has no right to be criticizing the actions of an elected official, let alone the mayor of the second-largest city in the province. It's Ms. Watt's job to represent, and act on, the wishes of her citizens. That's what she did in this case. For Mr. Graydon to call her out for that is not only completely outside his mandate but also terribly disrespectful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the very least, he owes Ms. Watts and the residents of Surrey an apology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Watts, meantime, has her own problems. Four members of her council, all members of her Surrey First party, voted for the project. There is a sense among some of them, it seems, that the city led the developer along. That in private meetings, it signalled the project would get approval if it just tweaked the proposal a little bit here and a little bit there. No doubt the developer feels it got stiffed, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not good. Any of it. And we likely haven't heard the end of it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time of year, when winter has closed around us like an icy tunnel and the only prick of light is the certainty that February will get worse so March can get better, I find myself prone to dark thoughts. Some people overeat, others over-drink and I, for my sins, have a tendency to over-think – mostly about the Apocalypse. Not in a depressing way you understand – I'm actually quite cheerful on the subject (it was a silly old world anyway and hey, it's time for a change!) – but in a closet-sci-fi-geek-meets-Seventh-day-Adventist way. By which I mean, I start looking for signs.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And here's a doozy: Earlier this week, Google co-founder Sergey Brin was photographed on the New York subway wearing a warm-up suit, a tuque and carrying a yellow plastic shopping bag. This, in itself, is somewhat remarkable given that Brin is one of the richest and most powerful human beings in the world and as such has access to enough money and technology he could teleport across town if he wanted to. But that's not what sent a chill down my spine. Brin, it turned out, was on the subway testing out <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s newest product prototype, the <span class="companylink">Google</span> Project Glass – a pair of spectacles with a computer screen in the top of the right-hand lens that mediates the world as you see it. For instance, if you want to take a picture of a snow-covered tree to send to your sister Hepzibah, you just say, “Take a picture,” as you are looking at said snow-covered tree, then say, “Send to Hepzibah.” Or if you want to know where you are, you say, “Where am I?” And up pops a map in your field of vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I saw the photo, I knew it was official. Computers have invaded our bodies and become part of us. The whole brain-implant artificial-intelligence thing that philosophers and science-fiction writers have been warning us about for decades – centuries even – from Descartes and Hilary Putnam (with his famous argument about the “brain in a vat” notion) to the great William Gibson with his novel Neuromancer (which spawned the cyberpunk literary genre and, later, the movie Johnny Mnemonic) is finally manifest. Not only that, it's going to be next Christmas's iPad – the gizmo that every self-respecting gizmo-consumer must have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obviously neuro-implants will not be far behind. As Brin's partner Larry Page told Newsweek back in 2004, “Soon ‘search' will be included in people's brains. When you think about something and don't really know much about it, you will automatically get information.” And given the omniscience of <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s other new product, Knowledge Graph – a radically expanded search engine currently being perfected that puts a search through 570 million references and 18 billion factual connections at last count (comparison: English-language Wikipedia currently has about four million pages), it's safe to assume that pretty soon we will all have the entirety of recorded human knowledge implanted in our mind's eye – a mind's eye that will be essentially owned by <span class="companylink">Google</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Science-fiction writers and filmmakers have had lots to say about this digital-age inevitability over the years and most of it has been decidedly scary. Even if you don't happen to think, as I do, that the <span class="companylink">Google</span> guys are a bit like the Taelons in Earth: Final Conflict (an alien race of beings who come to our planet and implant us all with their glorious technology, which turns out to be a bloody nightmare), most voluntary neuro-implanters or cyborgs throughout science fiction tend to be grumpy goats at best – and in most cases downright evil. Think of Agent Smith in The Matrix, Darth Vader in Star Wars, Dr. Octopus from Spider-Man 2 or the Borg Queen in Star Trek, just to name a few.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But will these fictional harbingers of doom prevent us from running out to the Apple store to get a shiny new 3G iBrain in the future? Of course not! And the irony is, the people first in line will be those most immersed science fiction – that is to say, the geeks. These are the kind of thoughts that keeps me up at night. Thoughts that make me want to run down the street shouting, “Come on people, have we learned nothing from the Tron series? Nothing at all?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But perhaps it's just January, and I'm being a bit alarmist. It is, after all, quite strange when a bizarre fictional concept suddenly pings itself in the real world. Staring at the Twitpic of Brin in his computer specs, I felt a bit like a Victorian lady who is shocked speechless as she watches one of those horseless carriages everyone's been talking about rumble by. So there it is, I thought, refastening my bonnet. The wearable computer. The screen you never have to look away from. The way that my family will choose to ignore me in the future. I suddenly had a terrible vision of myself holding a chicken pot pie and shouting, “Could everyone please take OFF their <span class="companylink">Google</span> Glasses at the table!” Before I pushed it from my brain. A brain that is mine alone – for now. But not for long.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary Opera is better known for championing new works than for clinging to proven favourites. So when general director Bob McPhee decided to turn the entire current season into a bicentenary binge of operas by Verdi, he prepared for criticism, which never came. “There was no reaction from anyone like, ‘Oh my God, a whole season of Verdi?' – even through telemarketing,” McPhee says.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he would never have considered a full season of works by another titan with a big round number to celebrate: Richard Wagner, also born 200 years ago. “I don't think that in our community, a season of Wagner would work at all,” McPhee says. “I think I'd be looking for another job.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the way it is for these two operatic giants: Verdi brings people in, Wagner stirs them up. Wagner gets the headlines, not always for the happiest reasons, while Verdi goes on filling theatres with works that companies depend on year after year. They're both titans of the genre, able to command passionate responses, which is why McPhee hints that we can expect some Wagner from his company very soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But do Verdi, even in a wacky production, and you're taking care of business in a time-honoured way. Make a move on Wagner, and you expose yourself to the risks, extremes and general weirdness of hanging with the last bad boy in the 19th-century pantheon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Wagner's influence was much greater and longer-lasting, in music and across the arts, as well as in politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was the one who turned the sociable theatres of his time into the hushed, darkened temples of aesthetic contemplation we know today. He insisted that art should be life-or-death work for everyone involved, and the lesson sank in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Before, music strove to delight people,” Tchaikovsky complained after attending the first Ring performances, in 1876. “Now, they are tormented and exhausted.” The gruelling art-is-everything attitudes spouted by painter Mark Rothko in John Logan's play Red are basically updated Wagnerian dogma, displayed in another way by the stark factory-like spaces of many galleries. But among this country's large-scale opera producers, only the Canadian Opera Company (which opens its production of Tristan und Isolde on Tuesday) and l'Opéra de Montréal (which did The Flying Dutchman last fall) have any Wagner on their bills this season. All other Canadian companies except Vancouver Opera are doing Verdi, as they do most years. The COC has done eight different Verdi operas since its Four Seasons Centre opened in 2006, but is only now returning to the composer whose Ring cycle launched the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wagner always imposes a high ante, in scale, expense and potential hazard. Not every company can afford a Tristan-sized orchestra, or even fit one into its pit. Casting the major works is notoriously tough, and if you can't get one of the handful of singers who can do the heaviest roles, you don't have a production. Even then, last-minute defections are a constant danger, as the COC discovered when its original Wotan left a huge gap in the Ring by dropping out during dress rehearsals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other ways, presenting Wagner is almost like entering a special boutique section of the opera business. Wagnerites tend to be extreme in their passion, and like the composer's Dutchman, they'll wander the Earth to get what they need. Every Wagner production of any stature is an international affair. Forty per cent of the tickets for the COC's Ring cycle went to people outside the company's usual market. It's safe to say most of them were after a different order of thrill than Verdi can offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It depends so much on your background and what you're expecting from opera,” says Stuart Hamilton, a veteran opera coach and sometime opera quizmaster on CBC Radio. “If you want a kind of out-of-body, transcendent experience, Wagner can give you that. If you want a work of great humanity and wonderful tunes, you're going to love Verdi.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two composers were opposites in almost every way. Verdi presented himself as a peasant-born man of the people, who aspired to be a full-spectrum storyteller like Shakespeare. Wagner thought of himself an agent of destiny, put on Earth to convert a degraded art form into a mythic ritual that could change the world. Verdi's operas (including Rigoletto, which the Met is giving a racy new Vegas interpretation starting Monday) are high-level entertainments built to avoid boring anyone for a second. Wagner's mature works, filled with iterations of events past and often already seen (especially in Tristan and the Ring), set to endless interweavings of symbolic musical motifs, aim to overwhelm the audience and colonize its thoughts and feelings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Characters such as Verdi's Aida know extremes of emotion and situation, but their fates are personal and their dilemmas are plain human problems writ large. Wagner's characters, especially in the Ring, move within a thick, confining web of myth, which he successfully laboured to give continuous sensual shape in music.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wagner's mature style is “probably the most self-conscious, self-willed, and deliberately assumed style in the history of European music,” writes musicologist Richard Taruskin, adding that that effort of will had a lasting effect on all who followed. “Unselfconscious style has not been an option for composers in the post-Wagnerian age.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Verdi accepted the formalized number opera he inherited, though he gradually wore down its divisions and in his final works, Otello and Falstaff, pulled Italian opera closer to his Shakespearean ideal of organic drama. He had many tussles with censors over political allusions in his works, yet his cause – liberal Italian nationalism – hardly resonates these days, even in Italy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The human world wasn't big enough for Wagner's metaphysical dilemmas, yet part of his goal was to provide a mythic past for his own strident brand of German cultural politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His murky tribal enthusiasms are still potent, especially in economically traumatized Europe, and his apocalyptic visions have become more pressing as we find more ways to destroy the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Verdi admired Tristan, though he was suspicious of Wagner's artistic program, and his personal cult at the festival he built in Bayreuth. When Wagner wasn't writing music, he scribbled thousands of pages of essays, pamphlets, polemics and crankish tracts on all subjects, but seems never to have mentioned Verdi. The only sign of his opinion came from his devoted wife, Cosima, who in one diary entry writes, “In the evening, Verdi's Requiem, about which it would certainly be best not to say anything.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This being the bicentenary, there will certainly be plenty more to say about Verdi, and Wagner, too. Stay tuned for more tributes next season to both of them, as well as to the operatic birthday boy they have largely displaced this season: Benjamin Britten, born a century ago this year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first time most North Americans saw Mads Mikkelsen, he was torturing Daniel Craig with infinite finesse as the banker Le Chiffre in 2006's Casino Royale. Not only was that the first 007 film the Danish actor was in – it was the first he'd ever seen.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I actually lied at the audition,” Mikkelsen told me during an interview in Toronto, where he's shooting a TV series. “During the whole press tour, I was still trying to get hold of what this Bond thing was about. In Australia, a journalist caught my trick; she asked me a 10-question quiz about Bond and I got zip right. So then I went back and saw them all. I enjoyed the universe, but I grew up with Bruce Lee and grittier action stuff.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he made that admission – in fact, as he said most everything – a small grin hovered around Mikkelsen's mouth. It softened the stark planes of his jaw, cheek and brow bones, which thrust out of his face at angles so dramatic they're almost cubist. The grin also conveyed that he's pleasantly amused by the attentions of movie stardom, but only to a point; he clearly prefers working to talking about it. His manner is genial but brisk, and at times his Danish accent recalls Arnold Schwarzenegger's Austrian one, only delivered at twice the speed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no doubt that Mikkelsen, 47, is having a pop-cultural moment. Last May, he won the best-actor award at the Cannes Film Festival for playing a teacher accused of child abuse in Thomas Vinterberg's The Hunt. Last month, the lush period drama A Royal Affair – Mikkelsen stars as the real-life 18th-century doctor whose relationship with Denmark's Queen Caroline helped bring Enlightenment ideas to that country – earned an Oscar nomination for best foreign-language film. (A Royal Affair opens in select Canadian cities this Friday, and The Hunt is due out this spring.) A Royal Affair is the second foreign-language nominee that Mikkelsen has headlined, by the way; the first was 2006's After the Wedding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As well, later this year Mikkelsen will star as Dr. Hannibal Lecter in the NBC series Hannibal, a prequel to the Anthony Hopkins films, which is shooting in Toronto. “He's a practising shrink who's hired by the <span class="companylink">FBI</span> to help out a younger profiler [Hugh Dancy] who has too much empathy,” Mikkelsen says. “They ask me to help him cope with his cases, not understanding I'm a kid in a candy shop.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this Mads-mania doesn't feel sudden to Mikkelson, however; he's been working toward it for a long time. As a child in Copenhagen, he was a gymnast, then studied contemporary dance. At 16, he began dancing professionally, touring the world and at one point working with Martha Graham's company in New York. (Mikkelsen's lissome screen presence reminds me a bit of Christopher Walken, who also has a dance background.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But I was more in love with the drama of dance than the study of it,” Mikkelsen says. So at 26, he enrolled in theatre school. In his final year, he cut some classes to shoot a film, Nicolas Winding Refn's Pusher. It would become a trilogy; Mikkelson reprised his role as the hoodlum Tonny in Pusher 2. When he graduated at 30, Pusher was already in theatres, “so I skipped the whole part of knocking on doors,” Mikkelsen says. Five years later, in 2000, he was starring in a hit Danish TV series, the police procedural Unit 1, which made him comfortable enough with fame that even Bond didn't rattle him – much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Shooting Casino Royale was not an extraordinary experience, in that we made scenes as we would have done in any film in the world,” Mikkelsen says. “But when we did the premiere in London, I saw the magnitude of what Bond is. There were 50,000 people in Leicester Square, we were walking the red carpet forever, we met the Queen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But you can only be famous to a certain degree in Denmark,” he continues, “and if you've been in a popular TV show, you're already famous for life. We say our ceiling is very low, meaning that you're not supposed to stick out in any way. Anyone who tries to ‘make it,' we take them right down. There are people who say, ‘Way to go, that's cool,' but the next day in the paper, the paparazzi will take my picture on the way to play tennis wearing something casual, or maybe when I have the flu, and they'll put up the story, ‘He's done! He's finished!'” He grins again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mikkelson signed onto Hannibal for the steady work and the chance to play a rich character. When he first read the script, he recalls thinking, “‘Can we get away with this on American television?' It's very elaborate in the way that people play with each other's minds.” He also welcomed the opportunity for his family to live somewhere new for a while. He and his wife, Hanne Jacobsen, have a son, 15, who's in school in Toronto, and a daughter, 20, who's doing volunteer work in India, “saving the world, as you're supposed to do when you're 20,” Mikkelson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I've always liked visiting Toronto, and it has not disappointed me since moving here,” he adds. “The Canadian people have the same approach to irony and sarcasm as we have in Denmark. It's a nice way of having a beer, instead of cracking jokes nobody gets. But they also have the ambition that we are fighting against back home.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lecter may be the stuff of nightmares, but playing him doesn't haunt Mikkelson: “No, I'm not tortured, ever. For me, it's always been about getting into the character as fast as you can and leaving as fast as you can. I don't insist on my family calling me Hannibal.” Grin. “But I take my work enormously seriously. When I do something, it has to feel right; everything has to be right. I'm not ambitious about my career, but I am ambitious with each job. I can be fairly annoying to work with. No compromises, let's put it this way. Compromises are from hell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I ask a million questions, and I insist on having answers,” he continues. “Yes, I've been doing this for years, but if you were doing it for only one week, you'd have a perfect right to ask those questions as well. I think that is what we have to do. I have to know what the director wants. Some are very much in their head, and I need to force it out of them. I can't just play around for eight hours and see if something happens. And I've called people in the middle of the night because there's something I've been thinking about that we're shooting the next day.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He can be intimidating, Mikkelson admits. “I never see that myself, but I hear it once in a while. Hopefully, people figure out that I'm doing it all for the film.” A final grin threatens to break out. “People will sometimes say, ‘Oh man, in the beginning I thought you were going to kill me. But it turned out to be cool.'”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two trends have snuck up on us – slower long-term economic growth and an aging society. Together, they will stress public finances and force harder decisions for governments, regardless of political stripe. They will put squarely before society the options of higher taxes and/or fewer services, options no politician or electorate welcomes.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> published economic growth estimates. The bank said economic growth in 2012, when all is accounted for, will be 1.9 per cent, followed by 2 per cent in 2013 and 2.7 per cent in 2014. If correct (and predictions are usually proven at least slightly wrong), that would mean an average growth rate of 2.2 per cent over these three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look back over the 19 years leading to 2011. According to the <span class="companylink">World Bank</span>'s numbers, Canada's economy grew at more than 2.2 per cent in 13 of those years, grew at less five of those years, and at the 2.2 per cent rate once. On average, the Canadian economy grew closer to 3 per cent than 2 per cent over that period of almost two decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Per year, the difference between 2 and 3 per cent growth doesn't seem like much. Add it up, year after year, and the gap is telling. More important, most of the long-term forecasting suggests that for the rest of this decade, growth will be slower than what we knew before the recession of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effects of slower growth will be twofold. First, government revenues will grow less rapidly than before, assuming no changes in tax rates. Second, some government expenditures will increase with slower growth, especially since slower growth means stubbornly high unemployment. The double-whammy will pinch government budgets, which are already strained by deficits, except in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, there is the aging population with fewer people in the work force to earn income for governments to tax to produce revenues for the additional costs of an aging society. The baby-boomer generation began to retire two years ago, the harbinger of what will be a lopsided population profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, about 14 per cent of the population is over 65 years of age. It is estimated that in two decades, almost 25 per cent will be seniors. The ratio of those working to those out of the work force will change slowly but dramatically over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless Canadians work much smarter and unless the Canadian economy becomes much more productive – both of which require, at a minimum, more investments in education and research (and reducing poverty, which is a drag on economic performance) – then aging will be a long-term drag on growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health-care spending for seniors, for example, will rise because there will be more of them. The best estimates suggest only an increase of 1 per cent in overall health-care spending, but that would be something of the order of $1.4-billion per year in today's dollars. Any ideas where that money might be found? Higher taxes? Reductions in spending elsewhere? Both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The extra spending is only one part of the equation. The other part is that fewer people will be in the work force to tax to pay for the higher costs. Call it an unfunded future liability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Political people are elected for four years. These trends, however, stretch far beyond one term in office. Finding political people who will explain these trends, and finding voters willing to listen to complicated explanations in a dumbed-down media world, will be supremely challenging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe the long-term growth projections are too pessimistic. Maybe startling technological breakthroughs will transform economic life. Maybe governments can reinvent how they deliver services, so that Baumol's cost disease – that public-sector wage gains outstrip productivity over time – will be proven wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe Canadians can be persuaded that they should pay a larger share of their incomes in taxes, and stop dreaming that hard decisions can be avoided by the magic potion of “efficiency gains.” Maybe the United States, on whose economic strength Canada depends, will recover its esprit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for now, it would appear that the already hard challenges of governing will become even harder in an age of constrained resources.</p>

The setting was the period when Jack the Ripper seemed to have stopped his killing spree, and viewers first saw a ghoulish bit of tourism unfold – people were being led around East London to see the exact spots where the Ripper's victims were found. At the same time, there was an avid tabloid press competing for new information about the serial killer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A body was found. It looked like the Ripper's work, but was it? It was the task of Police Inspector Edmund Reid (Matthew Macfadyen), his Detective Sergeant Drake (Jerome Flynn from Game of Thrones) and Captain Homer Jackson (Adam Rothenberg), a former Pinkerton detective and <span class="companylink">U.S. Army</span> surgeon, to determine what was going on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seediness and depravity of London during the period was on full display (in the U.K., where Ripper Street has been airing recently on the BBC, there were many complaints from viewers about some gory, blood-soaked scenes), and the series continues to be unafraid to disturb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second episode airs on Saturday – you can find the pilot on demand – and it becomes clear that each episode is both an excellent mystery and highlights a key aspect of the period in which it is set. The first episode dwelt much on the arrival of commercial pornography. This one deals with the role of children in the late Victorian period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A toy maker is found brutally beaten to death. A 14-year-old boy is captured by vigilantes, charged, prosecuted and quickly convicted of murder. The sentence is death by hanging. It's the job of Reid and his team to figure out if the boy is actually guilty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This leads them into the underworld of child-thieves and child-prostitutes. Thing is, of course, it's not so much an underworld – it's on the surface. It's just that nobody thinks much about it. At times the episode feels like Oliver Twist seen through demonic eyes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ripper Street moves quickly and confidently into the nets of intrigue in the plot, and anyone expecting a cozy period-piece British police procedural will be taken aback by the briskness, the gore and the savagery of the society depicted. It has an air of bleakness, but it isn't pessimistic. The acting is strong throughout, with Macfadyen especially effective. While Copper, the first made-for-BBC-America drama has soaked up tons of attention, it turns out that Ripper Street, made in Ireland for the BBC, is the very superior drama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also airing this weekend</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 19th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards (Sunday, Global, 8 p.m.) used to be a bit obscure, but since this thing called “awards season” evolved into a phenomenon, the SAG Awards are now on prime-time TV, and a lot of people watch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is an actors-only event – no speeches from behind-the-scenes people you've never heard of. Among the presenters are Ben Affleck, Robert De Niro, Bradley Cooper, Jeff Daniels, Anne Hathaway, Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman and Jennifer Lawrence. Leading the movie nominations are Les Misérables, Lincoln and Silver Linings Playbook. On the TV end of things, Modern Family is tops, with four nominations. Expect long-winded speeches and inside jokes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republic of Doyle (Sunday, CBC, 9 p.m.) involves Jake and Mal trying to find a kidnapped girl, and viewers learning more about Constable Leslie Bennett (Krystin Pellerin) and her very dangerous undercover assignment. No, she didn't go off the rails while pining for Jake Doyle. Who would? The subplot has invigorated the show.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's court decision has given Rob Ford that rarest of things, a second chance. Here is a heaven-sent opportunity to turn his stumbling mayoralty around – to put the distracting antics and errors behind him, regain control of a divided city council and show true leadership. Here is a chance, in short, to become what he has never been: a serious mayor for a city with serious challenges.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will he seize it? The first signals were not promising. Most people who have gone through a near-death experience try to figure out how they might avoid nearing death again. Some even consider changing the way they live their lives. Not Mr. Ford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference after the conflict-of-interest ruling, reporters asked what he had learned from the experience. “What I've learned is that there is so much support from the people out there,” he said, straight-faced. Apparently even critics have come around. “A lot of them said, ‘You know what? I didn't support you last time, but you've proved me wrong.'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked how he would deal with the challenges ahead, he replied: “Just like I have. We are running the city better than any administration ever has.” It turns out that when he said he was “humbled” by the experience, he didn't mean he was chastened or forced to rethink his conduct. What he meant was that he was humbled to discover how extraordinarily popular he is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of this should come as much of a surprise. Mr. Ford has never been one for rumination or doubts. Hopes that he would evolve in office beyond the angry, slogan-spouting suburban councillor that he once was have proved illusory. He is what he is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, without changing his nature, there are things he can do to make himself a more successful mayor. One is to pay attention to the rules. Mr. Ford got in trouble with the law in the first place because he flouted city council rules by using his status as a councillor to raise money for his football charity. The appeal court's ruling does not change that. It simply says that city council overstepped itself by ordering him to pay the donors back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a good thing that, in the end, the mayor wasn't removed from office over what was a relatively minor infraction. But none of it would have happened if he had paid even the slightest attention to the simple regulations designed to keep city politics above board. To avoid further entanglements, Mr. Ford must learn that the rules apply to him as much as anyone else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another thing he can learn is simply to show up. No one begrudges him his love of football or his devotion to his youthful team, but Mr. Ford has been a distracted, half-there mayor who often seems bored by the ordinary demands of the job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet another is to work with others. He could stop demonizing his opponents and reach across the council floor to build coalitions and get things done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other, smaller things, too. He could hire a driver instead of reading behind the wheel or quarreling with streetcar drivers. He could be a little more open with the media, instead of shutting off access to some and shrouding his movements in secrecy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If he manages to shut down the reality-TV sideshow and take a real interest in the job of governing, he still has a chance to rescue his mayoralty from the shambles it has become. He has made good progress on righting the city's finances, winning concessions from the city's old-time unions and contracting out services such as garbage collection. He told reporters on Friday that there is more to come, including a new economic strategy for the city, a new emphasis on customer service and even a broad transportation strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As fellow conservative Denzil Minnan-Wong put it, the legal and other distractions have “hurt his agenda, the agenda of running an efficient city…. I think he has an opportunity here to reflect on what took place and move forward and try to refocus his efforts.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reflection is probably too much to ask of this mayor. But refocusing should be well within his abilities. He has two years left till the end of his term. If he can learn just a few things from his recent dance with doom, he could still make a success of it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a milestone for gender equality, the Pentagon is finally ending the combat ban for women – a ban that had become woefully obsolete. At last, women warriors will get the recognition and promotions they deserve. The brass ceiling has been shattered, and that's good news for both women and the military.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or is it? I admire tough fighting women as much as anyone. Their leadership skills are as good as men's. They have important roles in war, and they've been on the front lines – and dying – for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But please, people. Let's get real. Women cannot equal men in ground combat, the kind of dirty, brutal stuff that (fortunately) makes up a very minor part of modern military life, especially post-Afghanistan. It's not that they can't be trained to kill – they can. The issue is that the physical differences between men and women are very large, and on the battlefield, they really matter, and can't be wished away. Men are better fighters because they are bigger and stronger and can endure far more physical punishment before they break down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average female soldier is “about five inches shorter than the male soldier, has half the upper body strength, lower aerobic capacity and 37 per cent less muscle mass,” Stephanie Gutmann, author of The Kinder, Gentler Military, wrote in the New Republic. “She cannot pee standing up … She tends, particularly if she is under the age of 30 (as are 60 per cent of military personnel) to get pregnant.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. Marine Captain Katie Petronio is as tough and motivated as they come – a combat engineer officer with five years of active service, during which she led many field operations. She used to think women like her could serve in the infantry, but she has changed her mind. For one thing, women are far more prone to injury than men. Her last stint in Afghanistan was so gruelling that after seven months, she had lost a large amount of muscle mass and stopped producing estrogen. “I went from breaking school records to being broken in a rather short amount of time,” she told an interviewer. “And I was only doing a portion of what my infantry brethren were doing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The full integration of women in combat roles has been portrayed as a breakthrough equivalent to the integration of black soldiers and gays. But when it comes to fighting, gender differences matter much more than race or sexual orientation. Not that any military leader dares to say so. Any effort to question the equal capabilities of women is a career-ender. And so we have developed the fiction that these differences can simply be negotiated away. With the exception of the Marines, training and performance standards in the U.S. military are now gender-normed (i.e., watered down) for women. Officially, this is not a problem. If a woman isn't strong enough to carry a wounded soldier off the field, they'll just work in teams!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What happens when women are fully integrated into combat? Fortunately, we have a great example: Canada. Overall, women account for 14 per cent of all jobs in the Canadian Forces, a slightly lower percentage than in the U.S. As a result of a human-rights decision, front-line combat jobs were opened to women in 1989. Yet today, despite strenuous recruiting efforts, women hold just 2.4 per cent of these jobs. Their commanding officers praise their competence but treat them differently, by shielding them from combat. According to a Wall Street Journal report this week, the widespread impression among Canadian female soldiers – much to their frustration – is they are used “only sparingly.” Men serving next to women also exhibit a counterproductive battlefield trait: protectiveness. They want to carry women's gear and keep them out of harm's way. As one told the Journal, “That brother-sister protective thought was always in the back of your mind.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the real world, few enlisted women want to be on the front lines. Like a lot of men (but more so), they join up for the free education and career training, and would really rather not get anywhere near combat. The drive for full combat integration comes from female officers who need front-line experience to build their careers, as well as from a persistent band of activists who have succeeded in making the U.S. military hypersensitive to charges of discrimination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowhere is the military ethos more challenged than over issues of sex, pregnancy and motherhood. The high rate of pregnancy among females in the U.S. military is a big taboo and an operational nightmare. According to a study reported this week by Reuters, more than 10 per cent of active-duty U.S. military women had an unintended pregnancy in 2008 alone – a rate that one of the study's authors called “really shocking.” But it shouldn't be. One study of a brigade operating in Iraq, cited by commentator Linda Chavez, found that female soldiers were evacuated at three times the rate of male soldiers – and that 74 per cent of them were evacuated for pregnancy-related issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside the developed world, women do not take equal roles in war alongside men. There is a reason for this. The reason is that women on the battlefield are a liability. The sheer physical demands of war (to say nothing of group cohesion, and all the rest) mean that fighting capability and performance are simply not compatible with gender equality. It's a fantasy to think otherwise. Fortunately, our world is generally peaceful enough to indulge our fantasies. If things heat up, we'll snap back to reality soon enough.</p>

As noted in the Canadian Encyclopedia, his drily sardonic reviews with their trademark “measured enthusiasm” were written under the daily deadline pressure of those days that often saw him having to produce a literate assessment in under an hour.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although never needlessly cruel, he had no problem with an acerbic verdict and this sometimes led to the charges from some in the musical establishment that he, and by extension The Globe and Mail, were “killing” serious music in Canada and Toronto. Then, as sometimes is the case now, there was pressure for uncritical criticism, for streams of rapturous praise to be directed at even emetic performances in the belief that falsely fawning reviews would encourage something other than a culture of mediocrity. Curious, then, that the greatest period of musical expansion, the phenomenal growth in audiences for serious music, and the rise to international excellence occurred in Canada and Toronto over the same period. His passing reminds us of a period of artistic expansion in Canada and any student of musical history who chooses to understand the era will have to consult the necessarily hurried but musically faithful accounts of this decent and conscientious critic.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's housing bubble has already set off many alarm bells. Economists fret over the risks of sky-high home prices, excessive consumer debt and the overbuilding of new condominiums.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's a less-known consequence of the condo boom in particular that could be equally damaging to the long-run economic viability of our biggest cities. The boom is gobbling up land almost as fast as it sucks up mortgage debt. Important tracts of urban space, once used to support jobs and produce wealth, have been drawn into the vortex of real-estate speculation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fat profits on multiunit residential complexes allow developers to outbid any other user for a given plot of urban land. That jeopardizes the sustainability of manufacturing, warehousing and other industrial uses. The resulting disappearance of decent industrial work will undermine the economic and social well-being of our biggest cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, industrial lands have already been bought up by developers willing to sit on it for years, hoping to cash in on eventual rezoning and development. In other cases, the enormous profits of residential developments are luring industrial employers to themselves consider alternative uses for their own land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That shift in corporate mindset explains the recently announced closure of the venerable Mr. Christie's cookie factory in west-end Toronto. Over the past decade, the plant has been fenced in by multiple high-rise condos. Former owners Kraft Canada joined with the City of Toronto to oppose further residential conversion of adjacent industrial properties, but they were overruled by the development-friendly <span class="companylink">Ontario Municipal Board</span> (OMB). Last year, the facility's new owners, Mondelez Canada, clearly decided that there was more money in condos than in cookies. They're shuttering the plant, laying off 550 workers – and readying plans for a multitower condo complex on the same land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another Toronto food plant, run by <span class="companylink">Nestlé</span>, hopes for a better outcome. Condo developers wanted to convert neighbouring lands for residential purposes, but managers and workers knew that would be a nail in the plant's coffin. Even if an existing factory is not directly covered by rezoning, the conversion of surrounding lands is usually the beginning of the end, raising real estate values, complicating logistics and bringing noise and traffic complaints from new neighbours. The company campaigned to preserve the employment lands designation, and won city council's support in November. However, Toronto currently faces 112 other applications to convert employment lands. And any decision, including the <span class="companylink">Nestlé</span> case, could still be overturned at the OMB.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto's sky-high land costs and constraining geography mean its land-use pressures are especially acute. But the threat looms in other locations, too. Lucrative residential developments in suburbs such as Brampton, Mississauga and Oakville are pinching the region's industrial backbone. The business case for new capital spending in one of the region's keystone auto, aerospace or food factories must now clear an additional hurdle: Would it be better to just close the plant and sell the land for condos?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vancouver, another real-estate hot spot, faces similar challenges. B.C.'s lower mainland has lost thousands of hectares of industrial land to residential conversions in the past quarter-century. There's little undeveloped space left for industrial use in the entire region. A new proposal to create an industrial land reserve for Greater Vancouver (similar to an agricultural land bank established there in the 1970s) is a promising response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate prices are finally beginning to cool, and this may ease the pressure on urban employment lands – for a while. However, the scarcity of land in is long-term, not cyclical, and zoning and economic development policies should make the protection of urban industrial lands a permanent priority. The option of closing factories in favour of condo developments must be eliminated through firm, permanent zoning rules. Provincial governments have a role to play, too: making sure developers can't sidestep city regulations through unelected bodies like the OMB.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The intensification of urban housing is clearly a good thing. But people living in all those shiny new condos need places to work – so employment must be intensified at the same time. Not everyone belongs to the “creative” class who will find work in downtown office towers or design studios. The future economic and social health of our cities depends on residents having access to decent, working-class jobs, right where they live.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Weekly Challenge is a column that tackles self-improvement one small step at a time.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days we're obsessed with self-improvement – note the recent New York magazine “Self-Help” issue, and the swell of self-help literature on bestseller lists. We are time-strapped and want to maximize our free hours with activities that make us smarter, slimmer, more accomplished, more efficient and so on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obviously, the desire to better oneself in such overt ways isn't a bad thing, but on the flip side, all of this Tao-of-Me time doesn't leave much room for what your grandmother might have called flights of fancy. Seriously – when was the last time you pursued something that wasn't meant to improve the value of your personal stock? And for that matter, is there even a skill out there that can be categorized as totally useless? Burping the alphabet comes to mind, though I imagine that might come in handy if your goal is to clear a room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For this week's challenge, I decided to spend time developing a talent that was seemingly pointless, and asked friends what useless skills they would most like to acquire. One said learning Latin, though I would argue fluency in an ancient tongue is highly useful when trying to impress fellow eggheads and/or kick butt at Jeopardy. Another said learning to tie a cherry stem into a knot with your tongue. One friend revealed she can fit her entire remote control in her mouth, which is hilarious and definitely useless, but a talent? I'm not so sure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Get crackin'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After briefly considering making balloon animals, I settled on learning how to juggle, mostly because a trio of very pretty beanbag balls showed up in my living room over the holidays. I have no idea how they got there, but as de facto owner I figured I should know how to use them. I also decided to learn how to crack an egg with one hand because 1) I was dazzled 20 years ago when Tony Danza did it on Who's the Boss? and, 2) I wanted a back-up skill in case the whole juggling thing went south.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both projects were approached in the same way: Seek instructional video on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, then spend a couple of days doing the “practice exercises,” which turned out to be a fun and relaxing break in my work day. Obviously, I wanted to be a successful juggler and/or one-handed-egg-cracker, but the fact that I was working toward these goals purely for self-satisfaction meant no pressure – no boss cracking the whip or nosy co-worker monitoring my progress. And, of course, there was that fist-pump feeling that accompanied even the smallest victories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Juggling is a journey</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bryan Smale is a professor of leisure studies at the University of Waterloo and the director of last year's Canadian Index of Wellbeing, which examined the different factors that contribute to a person's overall happiness and satisfaction. The study revealed that Canadians' overall happiness has been in decline; one of the key reasons is a corresponding decline in the time we devote to leisure. “People seem to think that everything we do needs to be utilitarian, which is not the case,” Dr. Smale told me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, he objects to the term “useless skill” altogether, since whenever we devote time and effort to a project, we are likely to experience satisfaction, gratification and other benefits such as stress relief and relaxation. In the long term, keeping up so-called pointless pursuits (whether a hobby like juggling or a skill like egg-cracking) can also help fend off mental deterioration and depression. After a few days' practice, I am an accomplished egg-cracker and a master juggler-in-training. I have always been fond of Emerson's quote about how life is about the journey, not the destination. He was probably a juggler too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next challenge: According to new research, sitting is the new smoking, as far as overall health effects are concerned. Stop the sedentary cycle and stand up – walk around, take the stairs or try standing at your computer for a couple of hours. Let us know how you fare at fb.me/globelifestream</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong Latino flavour of the 2013 presidential inauguration ceremony surprised a lot of Canadians, and not just because Latinos have obviously gained so much political clout in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During his State of the Union address on Feb. 12, President Barack Obama is expected to announce his intention to reform immigration and create a path to citizenship for the country's 11 million illegal immigrants – three-quarters of whom are Latino.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strangely, Americans see immigration reform as a way to “solve” a problem, when really it represents a historic opportunity for Americans to embrace their country's unique Latino personality – in the same way that English Canada acknowledged its French component 50 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Latino culture and the Spanish language are not “foreign” to the United States. They were present on the continent before the foundation of the United States. In fact, the 21 (other) Spanish-speaking countries in the world consider the U.S., at least partly, as one of their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many elements of Americana – the dollar sign, the dollar itself, ranch and cowboy culture, barbecues, mustangs and more – are Latino in origin. Spanish was the first European language spoken on U.S. territory. The oldest contracts, writs and charters date to the founding of St. Augustine, Fla., in 1565 by Spanish settlers – 42 years before Jamestown and 43 years before Quebec City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(By comparison, the Latino presence in Canada is a 20th-century phenomenon, although some explorers brushed its shores earlier. The Basques whaled and fished in the St. Lawrence as early as the 16th century. An interesting product of this is the French term for moose, orignal, which is of Basque origin. And there was a Spanish fort, Fort San Miguel, on Vancouver Island from 1789 to 1795.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, between 1821 and 1903, the United States actually entered Latino civilization by annexing, conquering or purchasing Florida, Texas, northern Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Marianas, the Panama Canal Zone, Cuba and the Philippines, of which only the last three are no longer U.S. territory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was how a hundred thousand Mexicans and a million Puerto Ricans became American overnight. Waves of Latino “immigration” followed, but mostly because the line between Mexico and the United States remained theoretical until the 1920s and not much of an obstacle until the late 1970s. And Puerto Ricans, of course, are not immigrants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Studies have shown that after 1850, the Latino population of the U.S. increased faster than the general population. But in the past 50 years, it has grown faster than that of any other Spanish-speaking country in the world – even faster than Argentina's did during its massive wave of European immigration from 1850 to 1950.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two factors drove this growth: the deregulation of the U.S. job market, which made it easier to hire immigrants, and the fact that millions of Mexicans sought to improve their lot as the Mexican miracle – a period of sustained economic growth and low inflation – was grinding to a halt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the U.S. is home to about 11 per cent of the world's 460 million hispanohablantes (Spanish speakers). According to the 2010 U.S. census, more than 50 million Americans – about 16 per cent of the population – are Latino; of these, an estimated 70 per cent (35 million) speak Spanish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This puts the U.S. fifth among Spanish-speaking nations, after Mexico, Spain, Colombia and Argentina. And if demographic predictions pan out, the U.S. will become the world's second-largest Spanish-speaking country within a generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Spanish-speaking world is acutely aware of the economic clout of the Latino United States. Since the 1980s, hundreds of radio stations, television channels, newspapers, magazines and websites have created an entire U.S. media industry that operates strictly in the language of Cervantes. Miami now competes with Mexico City's Mexiwood as the centre of Latino television and film production. In 2012, The Associated Press even published its own 486-page Spanish stylebook, with 4,900 entries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 1973, New York City has even been home to the Spanish world's 22nd language academy, Academia norteamericana de la lengua (ANLE). In 2009, the U.S. government recognized this academy as the official authority on language for GobiernoUSA.gov, the Spanish-language government service portal, which has 24 million users. And now, as a result of ANLE's work, hundreds of Spanish terms used exclusively in the U.S. will become part of the international standard of Spanish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the Spanish-speaking world, the Latino United States is quickly becoming a cultural and economic locomotive with a strong contingent of wealthy Spanish-speaking consumers. The per-capita wealth of Latinos in the U.S. is greater than that of Spanish-speaking countries such as Spain, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans sense the opportunity that Spanish represents. That's why an estimated 15 to 20 million Americans have already studied Spanish as a second language, with some 6.4 million more currently in Spanish classes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Americans study Spanish than all “foreign” languages combined. But, of course, Spanish is not foreign. It's a daily necessity for millions of working Americans. Immigration reform should not just legitimize the status of millions of immigrants, it should recognize the Latino personality of the country.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been a long history of native bands blockading logging roads in British Columbia, but the big, dramatic confrontations of the past may be fading, thanks to a quiet shift in government policy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a series of headline-grabbing events starting in 1984, the Tla-o-qui-aht blocked crews from cutting old-growth forest on Meares Island, at the entrance to Clayoquot Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1985, Haida elders dressed in traditional regalia were hauled away by RCMP officers on Moresby Island. And in a similar battle, Nuxalk hereditary chiefs from Bella Coola were arrested in 1997 when they defied a court injunction and blocked crews from logging at Ista, a place where according to native belief the first woman descended to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then there have been dozens of other smaller blockades around the province by bands trying to stop logging in the forests near their communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blockades will always be an option for bands that often feel desperate and ignored. But such protests may become unnecessary if the B.C. government succeeds with an innovative program it began recently, which is giving bands the power to decide if, when and how logging takes place around their communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government last week issued the Canim Lake band a first-nations woodland licence, a permit that gives the small community of 570 people long-term logging rights to 21,000 hectares of Crown land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is just the second such licence issued by the government, with the first going in December, 2011, to the Huu-ay-aht First Nation on Vancouver Island. Under that deal, the band got harvesting rights to 9,500 hectares of forest, near Bamfield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forests Minister Steve Thomson said his government is running behind schedule in its efforts to shift more logging to native communities through woodland licences, but he hopes to pick up the pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In the forest-sector strategy, we had a goal of reaching eight in the first year and it doesn't look like we'll quite reach that target for 2012-13,” he said in a recent interview. “We have a number of other [woodland licences] that are close, but we think we'll meet that target and probably exceed it for 2013-14.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Thomson said the strategy emerged from a roundtable on forestry issues, which among other things identified a need to give native communities more control over the forests around them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past two years, the government has signed some 60 forest consultation and revenue-sharing agreements with native communities. The woodland licences go a step further by giving control of logging to bands for 25 to 99 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Thomson said the long-term tenures will help bands secure investment and loans to develop their own forestry operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It really does provide the opportunity to build capacity in terms of employment in their communities,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Bourgeois of Healthy Forests – Healthy Communities isn't so sure of that. He says the concept of giving communities control of the forests in their area is a good one, but he worries the government isn't providing bands a large enough allowable cut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you don't have a big enough area and volume of timber, it is hard to succeed,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canim Lake band is allowed to cut 20,000 cubic metres of timber a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That's ridiculous, to be blunt,” said Mr. Bourgeois. “I would encourage them to be bigger.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said bands need an annual allowable cut of 100,000 cubic metres a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Thomson said he thinks the deals are working for the bands and will help create thriving, native-run forest companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you look back at where we were 10 years ago in terms of first-nations participation [in the forest sector], we've made very significant gains,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many native people might not agree with that. Idle No More, after all, was born out of frustration. But the woodland licences do look like a pretty good improvement on the bitter, logging-road blockades of the past.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parliament returns Monday to a legislative agenda that will largely be filled with housekeeping bills. The real agenda will be trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either as part of the budget, or as a stand-alone item, the Harper government will release what one official, speaking on background, described “as close to a white paper as the Harper government will get on trade.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That report will respond to the seismic shifts that are transforming this country's trading relationship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Canada's trading patterns have been fundamentally altered over the past decade,” the Conference Board of Canada concluded in a recent study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While trade with the United States has been essentially stagnant through that period, trade with the rest of the world has increased by 80 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to trade policy, the rule for government should be “follow the money,” Michael Burt, co-author of the Conference Board report, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Canadian businesses are already moving toward more trade with these Asian economies,” he observed. The job for government is to concentrate on “reducing barriers and making it easier for them to grow their business.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first priority for the Conservatives, though, is not the Pacific but the Atlantic. A free-trade agreement with the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>, the world's largest market despite its recent woes, was to have been ready by the end of 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as Barrie McKenna and Greg Keenan write in Report on Business, talks are dragging on, hung up over disputes on pharmaceuticals, agriculture products and other sectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, although an announcement isn't likely now until March or even April, a senior government official said that there is no chance of the talks collapsing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There will be a deal, absolutely,” the official said. “There's no way that either side can reach stalemate to the point the talks fail.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is whether the deal will be sufficiently ambitious to be worth the effort, whether both sides are prepared to risk and face down internal opposition for the sake of a comprehensive agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the negotiations at this point are being conducted at the ministerial level, no one doubts that Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Jose Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission, will have the final word.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the Pacific side, leaders from the 11 nations in the Trans Pacific Partnership negotiations – which include Canada, the United States, Malaysia, Australia, Vietnam and Chile, among others – are committed to concluding an agreement in time for the APEC summit in Bali, which begins Oct. 5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trade watchers are split on the likelihood of that deadline being met. TPP is ambitious both in its scope – nothing is off the table, including supply-management protection for Canadian dairy and poultry – and in its potential for becoming the nexus of a comprehensive Pacific free-trade economic zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Philippines, South Korea and Japan are thinking about joining, and there's even talk of asking China to sign on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Harper government is also in trade talks with India, Thailand and Japan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The global commerce strategy aims to give coherence to these disparate initiatives, by setting priorities and identifying economic opportunities in each market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are partisan political considerations, of course. Weak or unpopular deals could undermine support for the Conservatives. On the other hand, if the NDP or Liberals oppose any or all of the coming agreements, the Tories will paint them as anti-growth and jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So there is much at stake, politically and economically, as the Conservatives seek to transform Canada's trading relationship with world.</p>
