<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Boston Bruins</span> head coach Claude Julien may have been the first to comment on the the impact playing overseas had on some locked-out NHLers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Call it the Swiss effect, and how what looked like a good idea – staying in shape by staying active during the recent labour strife – actually backfired on some players.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the context of analyzing the play of Tyler Seguin in January, Julien noted his leading goal scorer of last season “had been out of sync because of the way they played in Europe with the bigger ice surface.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julien went on to say the game is much “more passive over there, so he's got more time and more room. Tyler, if you give him time and space, he's going to make something happen, but it's a little more aggressive, a little tighter here and he's re-adjusting.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hundreds of NHLers spent the lockout playing in a half-dozen leagues across Europe and Asia, and some made the transition back quite seamlessly. <span class="companylink">New York Islanders</span> centre John Tavares and <span class="companylink">Detroit Red Wings</span> winger Henrik Zetterberg are both in the top five in <span class="companylink">NHL</span> scoring and <span class="companylink">San Jose Sharks</span> centre Joe Thornton had a monstrously good start in the first six games before tailing off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many more ran into the same issues as Seguin, who had 25 goals in 29 games in the Swiss National League A, but had just three in the Bruins' first 15 games (one into the empty net). Rick Nash (<span class="companylink">New York Rangers</span>), David Desharnais (<span class="companylink">Montreal Canadiens</span>), Logan Couture (Sharks) and Dustin Brown (<span class="companylink">Los Angeles Kings</span>) all had difficulty getting used to the closer quarters of the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even <span class="companylink">Washington Capitals</span> star Alexander Ovechkin, who has experience moving between the larger international-sized ice and the smaller North American rinks, was slow out of the gate, and only picked it up again in the last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Brown, who played in Bern for former Kings coach Marc Crawford, “the biggest difference is the ice. Coming back here, I felt I had absolutely no room. I played about 15 games over there. I came back after the lockout and couldn't believe how quick it was, coming back to the small ice. Your spacing is just off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's probably a lot more turning over there – and more stops and starts here, because it's a shorter distance that you have to go. For me, the biggest problem was coming on the offensive side of the puck over the blueline. Over there, you have that extra 10 feet to find that soft area where the D can't come at you,” Brown said. “The flip side is, if you played over there, your conditioning is probably there, so it's just the timing of things. My timing was off for a couple of weeks.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shortened 48-game season is just past the one-third mark, and the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> game is starting to feel normal again to Brown. After a slow start, the defending Stanley Cup champion Kings have now won six of their last seven games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brown has scored goals in three consecutive games, after being held without one in 12 of the first 14 games. His linemate, Anze Kopitar (who played for a second-division team in Sweden), is heating up, too, and taking some of the pressure to score off Jeff Carter, who has been the only consistent on the team to date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Kings, who close out a short home stand Wednesday with a game against the <span class="companylink">Red Wings</span>, before heading up to Vancouver for a Saturday date with the Canucks, it is starting to come together again. Their revamped defence, which is missing three regulars to injury from last year's championship team (Willie Mitchell, Matt Greene and Alec Martinez), is improving. Goaltender Jonathan Quick is back in fine form.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But mostly, the Swiss effect is starting to wear off – and no one is happier about that development than Kings coach Darryl Sutter, unless it is Brown himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's a transition period, especially for the young guys and helping them get through the pace of the play,” Brown said. “I think they're getting more comfortable, not only with our system, but with the speed of the game.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Have food-focused guests you'd like to impress? Take inspiration from some of the hottest menus. Anchovies, spiced breadcrumbs, horseradish and espelette peppers are in high favour with chefs right now, because of the incredible depth of flavour they add to dishes. With a sweet, slightly smoky taste, espelette peppers are not too hot – they rate only 4 on the hot pepper index. The best anchovies come in jars topped up with olive oil. Horseradish both freshly grated or already macerated in brine gives a welcome punch.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lamb is a glorious way to show off a fine red (and vice versa). If you've got a dusty Châteauneuf-du-Pape kicking around in the basement, haul it out. The herbal nuances of Châteauneuf-du-Pape resonate with the flavourings here, and the ample fruit will complement the meat's gamey essence. On the more affordable front, try Chilean merlot or a Languedoc red, such as Minervois, Saint-Chinian or Corbières. As for the salad, the mind leaps to dry Mediterranean whites. Point yourself at the Italian or Spanish aisles and choose just about any white.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think bicycles, not mansions. Vancouver cyclists are hoping that community meetings in April over the future of Point Grey Road will shed light on the public benefits of creating a picturesque bike route for the masses.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the thought of rich homeowners getting richer, if car traffic on Point Grey Road gets largely diverted to West 4th Avenue, will be the elephant in the room. Under one scenario, city planners could designate the northern side of Point Grey Road for cyclists and pedestrians only, while converting the southern portion into a one-way street for vehicles travelling eastward. Many cyclists would like to see the 1.6-kilometre stretch from the Jericho Tennis Club to Macdonald Street restricted to local auto traffic and no longer used as a thoroughfare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Ladner is an avid cyclist and former Non-Partisan Association councillor who lives one block south of Point Grey Road. It is counterproductive, he said, to get upset over the prospect of waterfront and water-view properties benefiting if vehicle traffic fell sharply along Point Grey Road. “People wonder why should we pamper these people, why should we do something that is just going to increase their property values? There is a certain amount of resentment of rich people in the discussion, but that is totally uncalled for,” Mr. Ladner asserted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jerry Dobrovolny has received plenty of feedback on potential ways to overhaul the Point Grey-Cornwall corridor so that cyclists will be able to safely and comfortably commute between Jericho Beach Park and Cypress Street, near the southern end of the Burrard Bridge. Mr. Dobrovolny, director of transportation for the City of Vancouver, is aiming to present options for discussion in a new round of open houses in April, before civic staff make recommendations to city council in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 500 people attended a series of recent open houses held by the city, and another 1,300 residents filled out online surveys to give their input on ways to alleviate traffic congestion along Point Grey Road, which turns into Cornwall Avenue as you head east.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Change is difficult, and change requires some time for people to adjust their travel patterns,” Mr. Dobrovolny said. “We're going to start with a white sheet of paper and draw up some ideas and see what become options, and we'll bring those out to the public.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brent Toderian, former director of planning for the city and now an urban consultant, said the ideal outcome for cyclists will be a fully connected system of bike paths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Cyclists want a complete network. When you do it piece by piece, painfully and slowly, it tends to be controversial each time,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cyclists argue that introducing a bike lane of nearly 1.3 kilometres along one side of Cornwall Avenue (displacing parking in some parts) would make it safer to pedal from the Kitsilano neighbourhood to the southern end of the Burrard Bridge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An average of 13,000 vehicles a day travel along Point Grey Road, where some of Vancouver's most expensive homes are located. Cornwall Avenue is even busier, with an average of more than 30,000 vehicles a day. Some motorists say city planners should leave well enough alone, and instead target West 3rd Avenue and York Avenue as viable bike routes that could be improved by banning parking on one side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics are worried that traffic patterns will be thrown into chaos if the Vision Vancouver-dominated council makes dramatic changes to Point Grey Road and Cornwall Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We need to efficiently get to sites to do work at people's homes,” said painting contractor Michael Del Pellaro. “My staff can't cycle to those homes.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For city planners, the challenge will be to prevent a revolt from motorists, including those who prefer to drive west on scenic Point Grey Road before turning onto Alma Street to get to their homes in Dunbar and other neighbourhoods. Gordon Price, director of Simon Fraser University's city program in continuing studies, said the city has rights-of-way that would allow the road to be widened where needed. “Point Grey Road could become the de facto seawall,” Mr. Price said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Point Grey-Cornwall corridor, “we don't want to negatively affect public transit,” said Mr. Dobrovolny, who is keeping in mind the important route for buses along Cornwall Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said constructing a seawall between Jericho Beach and Kitsilano Beach is a possibility for the long term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever city council decides, easy solutions for promoting cycling remain elusive.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is asserted, by some of the learned and the great, that Canada has become a more conservative country. The Conservative Party has been in office since 2005, after all.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The party possesses an irreducible base of 30 to 35 per cent of the electorate that, during an election campaign, can be pushed into the 35 to 39 per cent range. It has certainly tried to change the way Canadians see their country, its present and its history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reading the latest Focus Canada survey from the Environics Institute, however, illustrates how little progress the Conservatives have made. If this survey (that goes back more than three decades) shows anything, it is how on many issues the government is offside majority public opinion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With our voting system, and with an opposition divided into three parts, a government can be offside the majority of the public and still win. Which is what the Conservatives have done, like the Liberals before them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Harperites are keen on symbols of importance to their core and, they hope, by extension to other Canadians. No such luck. They are gaga about the British monarchy. Yet when asked about the importance of national symbols, Canadians ranked monarchy last, a pitiful 17 per cent – way behind the second-least-important symbol. (A Nanos poll recently showed how the $30-million spent on “celebrating” the War of 1812 completely flopped as a way of re-engaging Canadians.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On more important matters, 23 per cent of Conservatives are skeptical about the reality of climate change, compared with just 12 per cent of the general population. Six in 10 Canadians say they would support a B.C.-style carbon tax, but only 43 per cent of Conservatives would.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two most important symbols for Canadians remain health care and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, neither of which the Harper government highlights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Support for bilingualism is growing. It's up to 63 per cent nationally but is favoured by just 46 per cent of Conservative supporters. Support is lowest in Alberta, the Conservative heartland. The aboriginal part of Canada's makeup is seen by about half of Canadians as an important national symbol, but by only 33 per cent of Conservatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On symbol after symbol, the Conservatives are in a minority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What keeps the government in good stead (at least with its supporters) on broad attitudinal opinions is Canadians' overall satisfaction with their lives and the state of the economy – except for low-income Canadians and Quebeckers, most of whom don't vote Conservative. The wider country's satisfaction is of long standing and, critically, was not much shaken by the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five years after that recession, the Environics Institute finds that 54 per cent of Canadians are “satisfied with the way things are going in the country.” That's the second-highest level of satisfaction in the world (after China), up from 45 per cent when Stephen Harper became Prime Minister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eighty-five per cent of Canadians report they are “very” or “somewhat” satisfied with the standard of living, a number that has varied little in two decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What about household debt, after the warnings by the government and the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span>? Some concern exists, 11 per cent being “very concerned.” By and large, Canadians are skating along somewhat insouciantly in the face of growing income inequalities, world uncertainties and high debt levels. They do believe, however, that their children might not enjoy as much good economic fortune as they have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the most startling (ominous?) trend is the disengagement of Quebec from Canada. Quebeckers had influence in every federal government until this one. No longer. On issue after issue, Quebeckers seem more and more disconnected from how other Canadians see the country – surely a reflection of the Harper government's complete tin ear toward the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This intellectual disconnect has not led to an upsurge in support for secession; indeed, a belief in the negative economic consequences of secession has grown sharply in Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of Quebeckers who report being proud to be Canadian has fallen to 34 per cent, compared with 47 per cent when Mr. Harper became Prime Minister. The number of Quebeckers who think they share the same values as other Canadians has never been lower.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Yeah, I'd say so,” Habs defenceman Josh Gorges said Tuesday, after a practice in Toronto. “The first game was the home opener and we got all amped up. Everyone was trying to do too much and we were chaotic. The last game was just one of those nights. We weren't ready to play.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Wednesday's game against the Maple Leafs at the Air Canada Centre, Gorges and every one of his teammates who were questioned along similar lines said, is not about avenging that 6-0 embarrassment on Feb. 9 in Montreal. And it is certainly not about paying Leafs centre Mikhail Grabovski back for his alleged chomp on the forearm of Canadiens forward Max Pacioretty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What happened yesterday, or two weeks before, doesn't matter,” Gorges said. “We get a chance … to go back and have a good game and get two points.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Get two points. That phrase was uttered so often in the Canadiens dressing room Tuesday you could just hear head coach Michel Therrien drilling it into them during a video session before they got on the ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's about that and showing the Maple Leafs what the Habs have learned since that drubbing 18 days ago. The chief lesson was not to come out for the first period and let the opposition bring the game to them. The Leafs scored twice in the first six minutes of that game, outshot the Canadiens 12-8 in the first period and never looked back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You can't come out flat and expect to win,” Canadiens winger Brandon Prust said. “[The Maple Leafs] are playing good hockey so we have to come out high-tempo and set the tone early.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They play hard. They have a lot of guys over there who battle and they're playing good hockey.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prust is playing hard enough to be rewarded with a spot on the top line with centre Tomas Plekanec after Rene Bourque was diagnosed with a concussion Tuesday. The news came as a “shock” to Therrien, who said Bourque was sent for tests for what the team had thought were flu symptoms that did not go away after he missed the last two games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Therrien said neither the doctors nor Bourque know when he suffered the concussion. (It could have been more than a week ago, which had some wondering if the punch Leafs winger Colton Orr used to flatten Bourque in that 6-0 win might have been the reason.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since that flat opening period against the Leafs in front of their own fans, the Canadiens have taken Therrien's insistence to come out hard to heart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They moved to the top of the Eastern Conference before Tuesday's games, on a recent 6-0-2 run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all but one of those eight games, the Canadiens held the opposition to six shots or less in the first period, and they were only outshot twice in that span in the opening 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We looked at it as a game to learn from,” said Canadiens defenceman P.K. Subban, a Toronto native who knows how emotional games between these old <span class="companylink">NHL</span> rivals can get. “So far, we've done a great job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For us right now, it's just about coming out, executing the game plan and getting the two points. Obviously, there's a little more emotion involved in the game but, ultimately, we just want to walk out of here with two points.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leafs head coach Randy Carlyle is in full agreement about the need to separate emotion from nailing down a playoff spot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That's all part of the white noise that we've talked about,” he said. “I think two teams are competing for two points; that's got to be the focus of our group. I know for sure that's what we're talking about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“[The Canadiens] are winning a lot of hockey games and they're getting a lot of points. We have to be prepared for our ‘A' game. All the other stuff is a sidebar as far as we're concerned. We're going to focus on playing the game.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE QUESTION</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can certain foods contribute to acne?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ANSWER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foods aren't thought to cause acne, but studies strongly suggest that some can aggravate the condition. According to a review published last week in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, refined starchy foods and dairy products are leading culprits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acne is caused by the combination of too much sebum – an oily fluid secreted by glands in pores – and a buildup of dead skin cells. During adolescence, rising levels of hormones, especially testosterone (present in both genders), are thought to trigger acne by creating a surplus of sebum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prior to the 1960s, dietary advice was a standard part of acne therapy. Patients were told to avoid eating too much carbohydrate and too many sugary foods because elevated blood sugar levels were implicated in acne. Turns out, there was merit to this theory. Today, the most compelling evidence linking food to acne revolves around foods with a high glycemic index (GI) such as white bread, refined breakfast cereals, white rice, cookies, cake and sugary drinks. One well-designed study demonstrated a significant reduction in acne when people removed high glycemic foods from their diet. High GI foods cause blood glucose and insulin to spike, which in turn, is thought to trigger a hormonal response that leads to acne.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I advise anyone with acne to cut refined (white) and sugary foods from their diet. Foods with a low GI that don't spike glucose and insulin include sprouted whole grain breads, steel cut oats, 100-per-cent bran cereal, brown rice, quinoa, pasta, legumes, nuts, apples, oranges, berries, grapes and pears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dairy products have also been linked to acne. People who drink two or more servings of milk, particularly skim milk, each day are far more likely to have moderate or severe acne compared with those who drink less. Researchers speculate that certain components in milk – other than milk fat – may stimulate insulin and growth factors that increase testosterone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you plan to cut back on dairy to see if your acne improves, be sure to include other calcium-rich foods in your diet such as fortified non-dairy milks, almonds, firm tofu, cooked green vegetables, and canned salmon with the bones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is some evidence that chocolate may worsen acne, but the evidence isn't as strong as it is for high GI foods and milk. Being overweight is also thought to increase the risk of acne in males and females.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids may actually help lessen acne. These special fats are thought to decrease inflammation in the skin and reduce certain hormones linked to acne formation. Good sources of omega-3 fats include salmon, trout, sardines, fish oil supplements, ground flaxseed, flax oil, chia seeds, walnuts and soybeans.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's a dinner-party brainteaser: Name the world's largest wine exporter in the 1950s. France? Italy? Argentina? Australia? How about none of the above? You'd be on the wrong continent with any of those responses. It was Algeria.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For much of the past century, the North African country was a juggernaut, shipping more wine outside its borders than France, Italy and Spain combined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Try to find an Algerian carignan or alicante today in your local liquor store, though, and you will almost certainly be out of luck. The country's output has dried up like a raisin. It's a boom-bust story chronicled in fascinating detail in a recent study by two Belgium-based economists, who say there's more to the tale than previously thought. Though a trivial player today, the Algerian industry left a potent legacy on global wine trade in the form of France's widely copied appellation laws, which were rooted in a movement that was designed to debase cheap African imports on the French market, the authors write.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People had written about the size and scope of the Algerian industry, but nobody thought about the institutional legacy and influence on French regulations,” says Giulia Meloni, a researcher at the LICOS research centre at the University of Leuven near Brussels, who co-authored the study with centre director Jo Swinnen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Algeria had been an inhospitable place for wine until its thirsty colonial settlers came along. Centuries of Muslim rule, combined with yeast-stifling heat that tended to stall fermentation, sealed its fate on the margins. That changed late in the 19th century, when French occupiers decided, against the local population's discomfort with alcohol, to make a serious go of it with the help of refrigeration technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What started as a cottage industry suddenly took on the imperative of a state emergency. Disaster had struck in France in the 1860s as the phylloxera root pest began ravaging vineyards. Domestic production plummeted, leaving a whole lot of coq in search of vin. To fill the void, imports, mainly from Italy and Spain, began pouring in, leaping tenfold in a 10-year period between the late 1860s and late 1870s. Then France turned to its more arid, but much more cost-effective, colonial conquest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 1871 to 1900, the authors write, 50,000 families, many former wine growers, fled to Algeria, occupying 700,000 hectares. They helped turn the vast country into a satellite farm for French tables, shipping back almost all their (mostly cheap, high-strength) wine, which at one point represented almost a third of Algeria's gross domestic product and half its export revenues. Every bottle, jug and tank landed tariff-free because Algeria was treated as part of France.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, French vineyards began to recover, aided by the discovery that high-quality European vines could be grafted onto roots of inferior – but phylloxera-resistant – North American varieties. A glut was nigh. Suddenly, posters in Paris advertising inexpensive Algerian product as “vin français” left a bad taste in French producers' mouths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1905, responding to protests, notably from producers in Bordeaux, Burgundy and Champagne, the French government began to enact a series of laws designed to distinguish “natural” wine from that sold using “frauds and falsifications.” Regional boundaries, until then a loosey-goosey affair, were drawn up, and restrictions were placed on permissible grape varieties and methods of viticulture for each region. (Never mind that a lot of Algerian juice had been surreptitiously used to pump up anemic bottles of Bordeaux and Burgundy.) The statutes were ultimately roped into a comprehensive 1935 law that formed the basis of the now-hallowed appellations d'origine contrôlées, or AOC, after which Canada's VQA system, among others, is modelled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AOC laws may have protected the vaunted status of Bordeaux and Burgundy (even if the wines didn't always taste better than Algerian plonk), but they did little to appease irate producers of cheap jug wine in the vast Languedoc region, who were competing head-on with Algeria for the bottom of the market. Rather than impose tariffs on Algerian imports – deemed politically unpalatable for a colony of Mother France – the government came up with another brainstorm: Tax overproductive vineyards across France (including Algeria) and force large-scale producers to uproot their vines or distill excess juice into high-spirit alcohol.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Meloni notes, that move – which, not coincidentally, hurt Algeria's generally larger farms more than those in the Languedoc – bears an eerie resemblance to current EU policies aimed at curbing oversupply across Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the protective market measures and the temporary devastation of the Second World War, Meloni says, Algeria still ranked as the world's fourth-largest producer in 1961. Algeria's fate as a footnote in the wine books wasn't sealed until a year later, after France pull the political plug altogether, retreating from the colony in a sea of blood. The country soon nationalized the wine sector and proceeded to mismanage it in fine public-sector fashion as France – finally – began to severely restrict imports. Algerian production dropped from 15 million hectolitres in 1962, the year of independence, to about 600,000 hectolitres in 2009 – roughly the same volume Algeria produced in 1882.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country may be yesterday's wine news, but Algeria's legacy of appellation laws and artificial supply-control mechanisms continues to stigmatize and marginalize supposedly “unnatural” vin ordinaire that doesn't enjoy the benefit of hoity-toity appellations such as “Bordeaux” or “Burgundy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One can see the ripples around the world today. Successful exporters such as Australia, South Africa and Chile, which stormed onto the scene with bargain table wines in the 1990s, are now struggling to shed the vin ordinaire stigma by promoting higher-priced – and higher-profit – offerings designated with regional appellations that mirror the premier cru and grand cru hierarchy of France. To compete in the fine-wine game, you have to brand your land.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec Premier Pauline Marois is reaping what she sowed on the issue of university and college tuition increases. Having supported a student boycott of classes while in opposition over a reasonable hike to the country's lowest tuition fees, she is now running up against a student leadership that will not be easily appeased. Thousands of protesting students filled downtown Montreal on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Marois's announcement of a 3-per-cent annual cost-of-living increase in tuition fees is an implicit acknowledgement that the universities need more money, and that the students need to contribute a greater share. Right now, they pay an average of $2,274 a year for an undergraduate degree, while Canadian students as a whole pay on average $5,581 (not including ancillary fees). The increase means an extra $65 a year for Quebec students, and breaks her campaign promise of a tuition freeze. (Disingenuously, she still calls it a freeze because the increase is meant only to keep pace with inflation.)</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the inflammatory climate Ms. Marois helped foster, even a $65 increase demands all sorts of accompanying carrots to make it palatable – to the students because $65 is too much, and to the universities because it is too little. Thus, she is promising to hire 1,000 new professors, 2,000 contract instructors and 1,000 other staff over the next five years. Ms. Marois is also promising that her government will balance the provincial budget. And the universities say they have an $850-million funding shortfall. Nothing adds up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec has a mess, and she made it worse. She irresponsibly fanned the flames beneath premier Jean Charest last year, knowing that Quebec has deep financial problems and high taxes and that the students were attempting a takeover of public policy by massing in the Montreal streets by the thousands on a nightly basis. Ironically, former separatist premier Jacques Parizeau is now doing something similar to her by urging her to consider zero tuition, the demand of the most radical student group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Marois's desperate attempts this week to reach a “consensus” around a $65 annual increase that will put only $12-million into government coffers may set her government up, like Mr. Charest's before it, for an unproductive battle. And she helped set the terms of engagement.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cardinal Mahony's presence will only further harm the church, and take the focus away from the important task of electing a new Pope for the world's 1.2 billion Catholics. The former Archbishop of Los Angeles has been accused of protecting priests who sexually abused children, claims that are backed up by church files.</p>

Although he has denied the allegations that he behaved inappropriately with priests during his three-decade career, the mere existence of such claims brings further unwanted attention to the sexual abuse scandal during this key transition period for the papacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vatican watchers have speculated that it was in part such scandals that led to the resignation of Pope Benedict on Feb. 11 – an unprecedented move that took even his own advisers by surprise. His resignation takes effect on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next Pope will have to work to contain the ongoing fallout from the scandal, which centres on the sexual abuse of children by priests, and the subsequent cover-up of their criminal behaviour.</p>

Cardinal Mahony has the right to attend conclaves until he reaches the age of 80; at least one other cardinal has noted that he should be guided by his conscience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By travelling to Rome, he has placed his own desire to exercise power and influence ahead of the interests of the church. His absence, in contrast, would represent a small step on a much larger path to restore the credibility of an embattled institution.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is so much newness afoot in the <span class="companylink">Toronto Blue Jays</span> clubhouse, so many new pedigrees and heavy résumés, that it is tempting to look past Ricky Romero and tell the erstwhile ace, now fifth starter, to just kind of get back to us when he has it figured out.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except what else is spring training for but to hope for things and maybe even quietly pull for players? And in the case of Romero, there are an awful lot of people in his corner, starting with Brandon Morrow. So, it was perhaps telling Tuesday, after Romero's first outing of a spring spent recovering from left elbow surgery (not to mention 9-14 with a 5.77 earned-run average in 2012), Morrow kind of peeked around the corner as Romero did his analysis for the press, waiting for the crowd to clear so he could access his own locker. Morrow heard Romero name-drop him, crediting Morrow with showing him numbers that revealed how little Romero used his two-seam, sinking fastball in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morrow tried to shoo away reporters by saying the statistics were available on the Internet, then offered a sheet that revealed there was a staggering drop in Romero's percentage of sinkers thrown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2011, all-star Ricky Romero threw his sinking fastball 26 per cent of the time to left-handed batters and 21 per cent of the time to right-handed hitters. The wreck that was the 2012 Ricky Romero used it 8 per cent of the time to lefties and 13 per cent to righties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was amazed by that,” Romero said, after giving up a two-run home run to Joe Benson in the <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span>' 8-4 Grapefruit League loss to the <span class="companylink">Minnesota Twins</span> at Florida Auto Exchange Stadium, leaving the game after 36 pitches through 12/3 innings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I felt like last year, I kind of abandoned that pitch, where before I threw it on a 1-0 or 2-0 count. I used it 90 [per cent] to 95 per cent of the time today. We're going to throw it and get the pitch under control. I want to get back to being a guy who is going to get ground-ball outs and quick outs and get back to the pitcher I was.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Romero said he had no clue why he ditched the pitch. So besides wondering why former manager John Farrell, pitching coach Bruce Walton, catcher J.P. Arencibia or somebody else didn't alert him to it, the logical explanation is all those scouts and opposing managers who spent all season whispering something was wrong physically with Romero might have been right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Romero suffered from knee pain late in the season, but in his last interview of 2012, in the dugout at the Rogers Centre, he talked about a clean MRI and was full of words about a calamity dodged and a page being turned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, he had surgery to clean out his elbow, and early in this spring he told reporters he had platelet-rich plasma injections in his knees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span> manager John Gibbons suggested he might have to pitch through knee soreness and all it took was to think: two plus two equals Brett Cecil, whose worries expressed after a so-so spring training outing forecast a downturn in his career. That's one reason Gibbons, shortly after giving Romero's outing a thumbs up, said he hoped Romero was happy about it when he talked to the press, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The knees feel pretty good,” Romero said. “We'll stay on top of it. We'll see.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Romero gave up a homer on a hanging sinker, fussed and fumed on the mound and slapped the side of his leg with his glove just like he did so often when he was falling apart in 2012, but he swore later he would keep throwing the sinker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Romero's former college catcher at California State University, Fullerton, <span class="companylink">Washington Nationals</span> backstop Kurt Suzuki, said last season that Romero was somebody who took everything to heart, perhaps too much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Romero is close to Morrow, who was gone for much of the 2012 spiral because of an oblique injury. Now, he has Mark Buehrle, R.A. Dickey and Josh Johnson, too. The bad news is he's no longer the guy everybody looks to; the good news is he's no longer the guy everybody looks to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's just Ricky Romero, and everybody's pulling for him.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's largest university, set in the heart of downtown Toronto, is preparing to drastically shrink its campus green space to build new artificial-turf playing fields for elite athletes. Many faculty, students and alumni are not happy with what is now presented to them as a fait accompli. E-mails are flying and petitions circulating. An important part of the university's and community's heritage is being jeopardized by the steering effects of Pan American Games money.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The University of Toronto's front and back campuses, the fields to the south and north of University College, have been oases of openness in the heart of the city. People meet and mingle there, jog, throw frisbees, hold demonstrations and play pickup softball and all manner of organized sports. Graduates celebrate on the front campus. Student soldiers drilled on the back campus during the world wars and the Toronto Argonauts have trained there. And every spring, around exam time, these great commons have to be closed off for a few weeks while their grass regenerates – as has been the case for more than a century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some exuberant athletes, it apparently isn't enough to share these beautiful fields with the rest of the university and community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many years, physical educators have lobbied to take over parts of the campuses and create durable playing fields with artificial turf. An offer from Games organizers to pay 56 per cent of the estimated $9.5-million cost of doing just this has finally swung the deal. Some months ago, the university's governing council voted behind closed doors to go ahead with the asphalting and artificial turfing of the back campus. Work is to begin this summer to create two world-class field hockey pitches that will be used for the 2015 Games, then serve certain of the university's athletic needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new fields will be fenced off and access controlled. The university hopes to recover some costs by renting the facility to other users. Because the fields are to be built to international field hockey specifications, it is not clear what other sports can be played on them. Certainly not rugby. Pickup Frisbee, kite-flying, dog-walking or kissing your date as you stroll across a moonlit pitch will almost certainly not be supported. Even gum-chewing should be banned, a maintenance manual recommends, also noting that the turf shouldn't be used frozen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some opponents of the proposal, who tend to come from humanities disciplines, raise many red flags about environmental hazards. While it's true that the nylon mat over asphalt over gravel will actually have to be watered and algae growth countered with herbicides (assuming these may legally be used in downtown Toronto), administrators pour scorn on this alarmism, their resolve seemingly hardened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These same administrators, however, are remarkably casual in swallowing undocumented claims from physical educators about student demand for the elite fields, and about the allegedly terrible conditions of the natural grass. Judging by available documents, the university's administration and governors have neglected to do any studies of the costs of an obvious alternative, namely a major upgrading of the natural turf in the interests of continuing traditional usage patterns. They see little downside in turning more than 10,000 square metres of verdant campus – heritage of the whole university community and the people of Toronto and Ontario – over to the athletic department to pave, mat, fence, rent and administer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many years ago, I played football on the back campus, played hockey on rinks there in winter, walked my girlfriend across it by moonlight. During the decades I taught at the university, its open spaces always inspired me. There were times when the university thought so too, its planning documents nearly boastful in offering its green campus as part of the Toronto heritage to be cherished and protected. No more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision to put artificial turf on the back campus of the University of Toronto is like Harvard proposing it for parts of its Harvard Yard, or of Oxford proposing it for Christ Church Meadow. At these renowned universities, such an idea would be immediately dismissed as an unthinkable desecration of a heritage landscape. It would not be tolerated for a moment. It is about to happen at Ontario's provincial university. The lure of easy money backed by the lobbying of a special interest group is proving irresistible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historian and author Michael Bliss has signed a petition to save the back campus.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Canadian scientists have exceptional abilities, and a fair share of them have made critically important discoveries that have been recognized by major prizes. For example, the late Michael Smith of the <span class="companylink">University of British Columbia</span> received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for his pioneering discovery of site-directed mutagenesis, a technique through which a DNA sequence is altered in a predetermined way to find out how genes work.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, Governor-General David Johnston and Professor Howard Alper argue in a recent article in The Globe and Mail that Canadians are not sufficiently appreciated on the international stage, and that this situation could be rectified by increasing the volume of nominations for awards, with a view to doubling the number of Canadian recipients by 2017. This is a laudable goal, which is to be applauded – it is a welcome moment when the Governor-General concerns himself with the excellence of Canadian science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an immigrant, I have to agree that Canadians indeed tend to be overly modest about their achievements, and certainly you cannot catch fish without your fly in the water, as we fly-fishermen like to say. However, it is worth considering what is required for a scientist to be recognized in the form of a major scientific award.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The essential ingredient, of course, is to do a piece of transformational science, which is distinct from simply doing excellent work. Such a feat usually entails a degree of luck, but also deep and ongoing funding, and often takes a long time to gain acceptance. A gap of 20 years or more between the work and its general recognition as uniquely important is quite common. Even the nomination process takes time. The Kyoto Prize committee, for example, takes some four years to do the background research to decide that an individual is truly worthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I worry that a deadline of 2017 to double the number of major awards given to Canadians is unrealistic, and that failure will be seen as yet another reason to cut funding to science. The problem runs deeper than the number of nominations for prizes. Rather, we should also be thinking about how best to support the science that will lead to international recognition 10 or 20 years out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ability of Canadian scientists to dream and make the kind of truly innovative discoveries that lead to awards is increasingly compromised by the declining levels of funding based primarily on excellence and vision, and the rise of support for so-called translational and targeted research, which is too frequently of questionable value. Canadian funding bodies are increasingly putting as much weight on non-scientific factors such as socioeconomic benefits as they are on scientific quality in deciding who to support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are entirely at liberty to do so, but they must realize that this strategy compromises innovation of the sort that will change the world. The funding that allowed me as a young assistant professor to do meaningful science 25 years ago is less readily available today, and without it we will not win more prizes, regardless of the volume of nominations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In my field of biomedical research, there are a few prizes that stand above all others in reputation, notably the Nobel, the Gairdner, the Lasker, the Kyoto and the Wolf. Of these, Mr. Johnston and Dr. Alper mention the Nobel and the Wolf, and yet the Gairdner is a prize awarded in Canada by Canadians, and indeed has been renamed the Canada-Gairdner International Award in recognition of generous financial support from the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span>. Of the recipients of the Gairdner Award, approximately one quarter have gone on to win the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is worth celebrating not only excellence in Canadian science, but also our ability to recognize great science regardless of nationality. Those associated with the Gairdner would likely say that it is the quality of a nomination and, most importantly, the transformative nature of the underlying science that leads to success.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could it be that the middle class was a late 20th-century fluke of history? For a few fleeting decades, almost anyone with an average IQ and education could reasonably expect to count on a decent job and pension. In the past few years, that assumption has gone out the window.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new reality is the growing polarization in the labour market between insecure, lower-wage jobs and secure, upper-income ones. The proportion of workers in “precarious” employment is ballooning everywhere. Even before the crisis, companies in Europe had essentially stopped offering full-time jobs with benefits. Temporary contracts are now the norm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increasingly, this is true in Canada, too. Companies and governments alike refuse to take on permanent employees eligible for full benefits. They are resorting to temps or contracting out services. This flexibility suits employers. But it is not usually a great deal for the workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of London professor Guy Standing has popularized a term for this burgeoning new class of insecure workers. Borrowing from the French, he calls them the “precariat.” And he warns they are a growing political problem, owing to their “anger, anomie, anxiety and alienation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This makes [for] a very dangerous situation,” Prof. Standing warns. He advocates more “redistribution to address this grotesque inequality.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authors of a new study on precarious employment in the Greater Toronto Area and Hamilton come to largely the same conclusion about what needs to be done for the nearly 40 per cent of workers in the region who, according to the study's generous estimate, now find themselves in insecure jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study – prepared by McMaster University professor Wayne Lewchuk and funded by the United Way Toronto and a federal granting agency – makes several reasonable suggestions, such as improving access to child care and training programs and boosting income support for low-wage workers. Overall, however, the report reads like a Canadian Labour Congress policy paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Providing more opportunities to join unions and form other types of collective representation may lead to more secure employment relationships,” says the report, which also suggests giving workers the ability to negotiate collective agreements at “the sectoral or occupational level” rather than only at the firm level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If anything, however, expanding union power in its current form would lead to even more precarious jobs and unemployment. Ask the hordes of recent teaching graduates who can't get work because existing union contracts are driving provincial governments deep into the hole. Or ask aspiring auto workers who watch jobs go south as the union here digs in its heels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oddly, the McMaster study ignores young people – it focuses only on insecure workers between 25 and 64 – even though youth unemployment and underemployment are arguably much bigger problems. In January, fully 13.5 per cent of young workers were unemployed here, compared to about 6 per cent of workers 25 and over. The <span class="companylink">Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development</span> warned Canada last year about the “under-use of skills that are costly to produce” as new postsecondary grads see their career prospects stymied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faced with iron-clad collective agreements, firms and governments string young workers along on temporary contracts. Yet, the Canadian union movement still blames greedy multinational corporations for the rise in insecure jobs, absolving itself of responsibility while erecting a firewall around shrinking memberships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, there has been movement. Ontario teachers will get conditional, rather than automatic, inflation protection on their pensions. The Canadian Auto Workers has agreed to lower wages for new hires, although pay rises to the full rate after 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, such “concessions” are minor relative to the scope of the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CAW's refusal to agree to a permanent two-tier wage structure is one reason Canada's share of North American auto production and employment is expected to shrink over the next five years – in spite of a costly taxpayer bailout in 2009. In the U.S., where the <span class="companylink">United Auto Workers</span> has signed off on permanently lower wages for new hires, jobs are booming and workers at the Big Three are pocketing $780-million (U.S.) in profit-sharing cheques for 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian unions deserve a lot of credit for creating the middle class. But if they were truly committed to preserving what's left of it and shrinking the precariat, they would reconsider their ostrich-like refusal to abandon a 1970s-style bargaining strategy. They just might become relevant again.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At council's government management committee on Monday, they voted for a proposal to buy only Fair Trade coffee, sugar and tea for city shelters and long-term care homes. The goal is to support a campaign by Fair Trade activists to get Toronto qualified as an internationally recognized Fair Trade Town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To that end, said a seven-page staff report on this burning issue, the city's Environment and Energy Office “will designate a staff member to be appointed to Fair Trade Toronto's Fair Trade Towns Committee.” The report asserts that, because the city will invite competing bids, buying Fair Trade won't push up the cost of the $300,000 in tea, coffee and sugar the city buys every year. We'll see about that, but with all the challenges faced by people in shelters or long-term care, is buying Fair Trade coffee really a priority?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few days earlier at city council, councillors voted to order up “a comprehensive review of the implications, locally, of depleting oceanic species that are used as food sources.” What has that got to do with filling pot holes and keeping the streetcars running on time, you might ask.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But city councillors don't like to limit themselves to such petty concerns. In 2011, they adopted a bylaw banning the possession, sale and consumption of shark fin and shark-fin products. Though international fisheries management is a federal, not municipal concern, they argued that Toronto should take the lead in combatting barbaric fishing practices like shark finning. The courts disagreed and struck down the bylaw, saying the city had overstepped its authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, rightfully, should have been the end of it. Last week's motion is a last-ditch attempt by pro-ban councillors to keep the issue alive. Council instructed the city's manager and its medical officer of health to identify any “health, environmental, ecological and animal-welfare consequences” of species depletions in the high seas and to consider “shark populations and shark finning.” If that seems a bit far from the medical officer's usual tasks – like, say, flu shots and AIDS prevention – shame on you for being so provincial. Council has grander ideas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest headlines out of council's monthly meeting came out of its move to protect undocumented migrants from being denied city services. The Toronto Star trumpeted it as a historic move to declare Toronto a “sanctuary city” for people without papers. Ryerson University professor Harald Bauder called it “a heroic step” to guard the vulnerable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is only one little problem: Toronto already offers services to undocumented residents. The city doesn't ask anyone for papers when they use child care, libraries, shelters, community centres and a host of other services. In 2007, it even put out a poster, to be displayed at city service sites, explaining its don't-ask policy, just in case undocumented residents were afraid of being carded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At last week's meeting, council simply voted to “reaffirm its commitment” to providing services to everyone. Under its directive, the city will look into training city staff on the existing policy, launching an education policy and creating a “complaints protocol.” It will also ask Ottawa to set up a “regularization program” for undocumented residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why all the fuss? Councillor Joe Mihevc told CBC Radio that, while the old policy was reactive, “this one is more proactive.” Asked if undocumented residents were being denied services, he said there had been “many a story” about people being asked for their papers and bolting for the door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports this week say Mr. Ford has gone to <span class="companylink">Disney</span> World for a family vacation. He may find that less of a fantasy world than the one he left behind.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a spring hockey game about 10 years ago. My son was playing on a team of 13- and 14-year-olds. They were being coached by a friend of mine, whose son was a star forward.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The game ended and a scuffle broke out on the ice. It looked fairly harmless from the stands but it was clear that the two young referees were struggling to bring calm to the situation. On to the ice barged our coach, heading toward the heart of the commotion with a determined bearing, anger clearly on his face. I sat in my seat incredulous, thinking to myself: No good can come of this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I was right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he arrived at the epicentre of the skirmish, he pushed one of the opposing team's players to the ice. He, in turn, was jumped by a couple of the player's teammates. Our coach's glasses went flying from his face. It was about as ugly a scene at a minor hockey league game as I had witnessed – and by that point in my son's hockey career, I had seen plenty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, calm was restored but inside the arena the parents of the other team wanted our coach's head – and who could blame them? Wisely, our coach stayed hidden away until well after the braying mob stopped calling his name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later that night, I talked to the coach, my friend, a person I knew, or thought I knew, for years. He was, by all measures, a decent human being, a loving and devoted husband and father. But in a single instance, every impression I had of him was cast into doubt. Did I really know him at all?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don't know what happened,” he would tell me. “I lost my mind.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was reminded of this moment this week as I welcomed the news that a B.C. Provincial Court judge had sentenced a minor-league hockey coach to 15 days in jail and one year's probation for tripping a 13-year-old player from the opposing team during a postgame, on-ice handshake. The incident was caught on camera and became an instant Internet sensation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sentence caught many, including the Crown, by surprise. No one thought jail time was in the cards for the coach, Martin Tremblay, 48. But in his decision, Judge Patrick Chen said the tripping of the boy was “akin to a cowardly sucker punch on an unsuspecting victim.” The judge said his sentence was intended to convey the message that assaulting a child, under any circumstances, is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision was widely applauded. Like many, I wondered if Judge Chen had a hockey background, maybe had witnessed the mindless, often incomprehensible behaviour exhibited by normally right-thinking adults every day in minor-hockey rinks across this country. People like my friend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This we all know: Minor hockey does strange things to some people. It can make them temporarily nuts. It can bring to the fore elements of their character and personality that can go into lifelong hibernation once minor hockey is behind them. And while I commend Judge Chen for his gutsy call and hope it establishes a legal precedent and makes people think twice before doing something as unconscionable as what Mr. Tremblay did, we all know it will not prevent these things from happening again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor will it stop the assaults-by-proxy that go on in minor hockey league rinks every day in Canada; the coaches who urge their players to go after someone on the other team, someone as young as 9 or 10. Believe me this happens. I've seen it. I've heard it. The instructions may not be as explicit as “slash his ankles,” “hack his wrists,” “knock his block off,” but they don't have to be. So much about hockey, especially at the higher, rep levels, is implied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there are the parents in the stands heaping the worst kind of abuse and vitriol on players and referees still in elementary school. It's assault by a different name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, most minor-hockey parents are wonderful, well-adjusted folk, who are there to support their kids in the healthiest way possible. But there are enough fools, enough people who allow a game played by kids to turn them into common criminals, that we need to be continually vigilant of damage they can cause. And we need do even more to deter them from occupying our rinks and coaching our kids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his own way, that is what Judge Patrick Chen was trying to do this week. And for that we owe him our thanks.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because simple tolerance, mere tolerance, is not enough. We need genuine and deep respect for each and every human being notwithstanding their thoughts, their values, their beliefs, their origins.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These words, spoken by Justin Trudeau during a moving eulogy for his father, resonated deeply with Canadians, for they spoke to shared humanity. Given recent flashpoints of aboriginal self-assertion, linguistic tensions in Quebec and the income divide, it is a message worth revisiting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Todd L. Pittinsky of <span class="companylink">Stony Brook University</span>, a senior lecturer at Harvard and author of Us Plus Them, has studied the dual concepts of recognizing and embracing differences. He has coined the term “allophilia” to describe positive intergroup dynamics superseding tolerance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He believes current anti-racism/diversity training programs do not tap in to the latent potential of individuals to develop strong bonds with those outside their own “group.” These programs are often ambivalent about differences. He recalls attending a corporate diversity training session in which the first slide, “Diversity Is Our Strength,” was contradicted by a later slide, “We Are All the Same.” They also ignore research about innate allophilic characteristics, and the strong interpersonal cohesion that develops from them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Prof. Pittinsky's research, five components provide a measure of allophillia: having positive feelings toward members of the other group (affection); feeling comfortable and at ease with them (comfort); believing there is a close connection with them (kinship); seeking interactions with them (engagement); and finally, feeling impressed and inspired by them (enthusiasm).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has seen allophilic initiatives blossom at the grassroots. For example, about 10 years ago, Maine received an influx of Somali immigrants. “They were about as ‘other' as possible in one of the ‘whitest states in America,'” he remarked. Then, members of a local adult-learning centre organized potluck dinners for American and Somali families, fostering cross-cultural friendships and bonds. They tried each other's dishes, tied head scarves and painted henna tattoos. “The two groups were still very different,” he observes, “but they enjoyed their differences.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governments are starting to listen to Prof. Pittinsky. Minnesota recently sponsored a state-wide celebration for Martin Luther King Jr. Day focused on “moving beyond tolerance to allophilia.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are economic ramifications, too. “The desperate search for economic growth will put added pressure on organizations, public and private, to finally get serious about diversity in the workplace as an engine of innovation – not just as window-dressing,” says Prof. Pittinsky, adding, “That can work, but not without allophilia.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Religious differences may become a source of tension. However, Prof. Pittinsky believes that if North American religious leaders promote allophilia, deep social bonds can develop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The view of religion as a source of social cohesiveness may seem counterintuitive. Yet, according to current research, attachment and identification with one's own group enhances positive disposition toward others. Problems occur when leaders encourage an inward focus and outward animosity at the expense of others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is this a problem in Canada?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the 2011 Focus Canada survey by the Environics Institute, 79 per cent of Canadians profess a belief in God or “universal spirit.” More importantly, it found that “religion does not appear to be a source of division within Canadian society,” while the majority take pride in our multicultural policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Toronto-based Inspirit Foundation seems to have tapped in to both the spiritual and allophilic potential of Canadians by promoting initiatives related to pluralism among young Canadians of different spiritual, religious and secular backgrounds. These include an innovative project in Winnipeg, where aboriginal youth will share with newcomer youth indigenous history, spirituality and strategies that foster integration and respect for diversity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Inspirit president and CEO Andrea Nemtin, the goal is to help future leaders “build a more inclusive and pluralist society; a society where we actively engage with each other's differences and where all these differences, which include our ethnicity, culture and beliefs, are celebrated.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's apply these deep-seated principles toward addressing tensions in our society today.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few hours before his <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span> played the <span class="companylink">Montreal Canadiens</span>, Dion Phaneuf talked about how much fun it is to play their most hated rival.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As players, you love rivalry games,” Phaneuf said. “Both teams have been playing well this year. So it's a big game in the standings, it's a big game in the rivalry. And as players, we love to play in these types of games.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phaneuf, who laid some big hits on the Habs Wednesday night but committed an almost equal number of mistakes, might have found the fun was more in the anticipation than the actual execution. The Leafs were fortunate the Canadiens did not bury them in the first two periods and they were still in contention in the third, although their offensive failings led to a 5-2 win for the visitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadiens lived up to their vow to come out hard after letting the Leafs take the play to them in the first period of their previous game on Feb. 9, which turned out to be a 6-0 laugher for the Leafs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, they put their feet on the Leafs' necks and kept them there, outshooting the hosts 6-1 through the first seven minutes, 10-4 by the end of the first period, and then running up an 8-0 margin in shots by the two-minute mark of the second thanks to a dubious major penalty for checking from behind issued to Leafs winger Mike Brown, who also drew a game misconduct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this was a rivalry game, so things were a little out of the ordinary. Somehow, the Leafs survived all of that and got to the third period with the score tied 2-2. They did it with some luck (the Canadiens whiffed on some great chances during that five-minute power play and later hit a post), some great saves by goaltender Ben Scrivens, and by taking advantage of the few scoring opportunities they were allowed in the first 40 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which made it all a lot more fun for the fans, although it was hard to tell at times given the usual passivity of the Air Canada Centre habitués.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What has plagued this rivalry for the last 20 years or so and for a long stretch in the 1980s is that both teams were rarely among the league's best at the same time. If one team finally turned itself into a contender, the other, which was invariably the Leafs it seems, was a doormat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the games between them still had lots of emotion, there were not too many moments of dazzling hockey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going into Wednesday's game, though, the Canadiens were first in the Eastern Conference with a 12-4-3 record and the Leafs were just three points behind, albeit in seventh place, with a 12-8 record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is maybe the most storied rivalry in hockey,” said Canadiens defenceman Josh Gorges, who was on the receiving end of that Brown hit. “When you have two teams that are good teams, it makes for exciting hockey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Any time you play the Leafs the games are always hard-fought. They're close, tight-checking even if one team is in first and one is in last. But to have two teams playing well and both are good hockey clubs, it adds a little more.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, that's the way things started, at least. The Canadiens easily controlled the play but the Leafs made themselves known on the physical side of the game. The Leafs held a 20-11 edge in hits after the first period and 31-17 by the end of the second.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leafs head coach Randy Carlyle was happy enough to let the bruisers go, as winger Colton Orr had 10 minutes of ice time after 40 minutes, compared to 9:18 for No. 1 centre Tyler Bozak. While some may argue that's why the Leafs' offence was so quiet, there was no arguing the fact the best line in the game was the Canadiens' top unit of centre Tomas Plekanec and wingers Brandon Prust and Brian Gionta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, the Canadiens made their point with their first win over the Leafs this season, that they are a good team that happened to play two bad games against the Leafs. And the Leafs avoided getting blown out as badly as the Habs were, which means lots of buildup for their next game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since that game isn't until April 13, there should be lots of fun in the anticipation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Supreme Court</span>'s ruling in the Whatcott case, a nuanced and well-crafted decision, resolves a number of important issues concerning the interpretation and constitutionality of human rights codes. But in spite of the court's assurances that individuals remain free to debate questions of sexual morality in the public sphere, the practical effect of the ruling is to all but strangle certain kinds of argument – particularly those made from a religious point of view.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision rests on a compelling premise: that published statements treating members of vulnerable minority groups as less worthy of dignity or respect – as less human – than the rest of us don't deserve the same degree of Charter protection as other exercises of expressive freedom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason is simple. By demeaning members of that group, and suggesting that they are inherently immoral, irrational or criminal, one effectively makes it more difficult for them to participate in public discourse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The kneejerk response is to say, as Bill Whatcott and several intervenors did, that one can criticize a practice without suggesting that those who engage in it are somehow subhuman or less worthy of respect as persons. The court agreed, to a point. But some practices, it observed, are so central to the identity of a group that one cannot disparage one without degrading the other. It is, for example, difficult to criticize the act of engaging in homosexual practices without suggesting that there is something inherently wrong with those who want to engage in them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One can still criticize certain sexual practices, but the objection must be framed so it is not irretrievably tied to the identity of a particular vulnerable minority. In other words, one may not proceed on the basis that a practice is made worse or more disgusting merely because bisexual, lesbian or gay persons engage in it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The court goes to great pains to argue that its ruling in Whatcott does not bar religious persons and groups from expressing their views about sexual morality in the public sphere. That may be true in principle, but in practice, I am not so sure. For many Christians, the fact that a sexual practice is engaged in by members of the same sex is spiritually and morally significant. Requiring them to frame arguments against certain sexual practices as though participants' gender is irrelevant will tend to distort their views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We should not kid ourselves, either, that this ruling won't affect the expressive freedom of those too unsophisticated or inarticulate to construct an argument addressing the merits of sexual practices without disparaging those who engage in them. The court in Whatcott engaged in a line-by-line reading of the offending pamphlets, parsing them much more finely than the lower courts. It is all well and good to say that someone who wants to engage in debate on such a sensitive issue ought to be “encouraged” to think carefully about how his words are likely to be received. But if one cannot enter into the debate without first having a lawyer vet the text, we have imposed a very real burden on those who believe that their religious principles require them to proselytize on sexual morality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision in Whatcott forces one to ask just how important it is that matters of private sexual morality be debated in the public sphere. Maybe it's fair enough to say that the state has no place in the bedrooms of the nation. But does that mean private citizens should not be allowed to express an opinion about what goes on in them? Although it may seem trivial for many of us, for others, sexual morality is tied to questions of highest spiritual significance and urgency. Perhaps a commitment to equality demands that their views be muffled somewhat. If so, though, we should be honest about what we are doing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no happy ending yet for the 29-year-old who lit up our website last spring with the story of his difficulties finding a job.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To quickly catch up, he recently turned 30. And while he's been working away at contract jobs in recent months, he has yet to find the full-time position he's seeking. It's no less tough out there today for young adults trying to build their careers, he'd tell you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This young man sent me a long and articulate e-mail after reading a May 7 column I wrote on how today's college and university graduates have it tougher than I did when I graduated in the mid-1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We published the letter in full on our website and a massive number of people read it and responded with comments and e-mails. Then, earlier this month, the story surged again online after being discussed on the website Reddit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was then that I decided to check in with the author of the letter to see how he's doing. Here's an edited transcript of our conversation (he asked that his name not be used):</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How was turning 30?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Awful. I didn't think I'd be here at 30. I thought I'd be a little more settled. By the time my parents were 30, they had kids, they had their first place and they had their careers reasonably settled on. That's not really the case with me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where are you right now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've done more contract work with various marketing and promo companies. It's been awesome as far as gaining experience and more contacts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are you on a contract as we speak?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No, I'm between contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why haven't the contracts produced a full-time position for you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good question. It's because there's no full-time opportunity. The jobs pay rather well while you're doing them, but it's a lot cheaper for companies to hire as they need people and then dump them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Were you surprised at the huge response to your letter after we published it online?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wasn't expecting it. I'm not the only person in this situation, but [the job challenges of young adults] are not something that gets talked about. You'll read about it in The New York Times and The Globe now and then, but people don't talk about it. It's a bit like mental health that way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've seen people respond to your letter by saying Generation Y ‘wants it all' and isn't willing to put in the work to make it happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We want it all? Yeah, we want it all. We were sold it all. We bought in. I went through my early childhood to my late teens being told that if I worked my ass off and did everything I was supposed to, it would work out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What about the comment that young adults won't put in the work?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the single most frustrating thing you hear. If I were to actually honestly list my job experience, it would be six pages long and have about 18 service jobs on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are your friends in the same position as you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A solid majority of people I know are either vastly underemployed or really doing worse than that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How are you getting by financially?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the great part of being good about saving money. When you know money ebbs and flows, you plan for the ebbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do you have your own place?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have three roommates in a house in the Vancouver area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How supportive has your family been?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't know how to say ‘amazing' enough. They've been great. They've been people to go back to and say, ‘this really sucks,' and they turn around and say, ‘this isn't just happening to you.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's your academic background?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four-year communications degree. Good school. I'd hate to have the name published because it would be unfair to blame the school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After your letter was published, a number of corporate recruiters offered to help you with your résumé. How did that work out?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anybody who offered help, I got in touch with. I think I went through about 40 versions of my résumé with about half a dozen recruiters. I've come up with something pretty solid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Has it helped you get contract jobs?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What would you do differently if you could go back and repeat your university years?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, I would have taken a year off before university. If you're 18 and you're going to [university or college], don't. Take a year because you're not ready for it. Also, I would have taken a much closer look at corporate Canada, and what sectors are doing extremely well. I would have majored in something related, or at least minored in it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In your letter last May, you said you were hopeful of finding a career-starting job despite the challenges. Are you still optimistic?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm still trending toward hopeful for sure.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘NOT NO-FUTURE LOSERS'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's an excerpt from the original e-mail sent last May from the 29-year-old job seeker:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Rob, we're not no-future losers. You know those high-school kids who study hard, get great grades, have part-time jobs, and manage to excel at athletics all at the same time? That was us. The university students who go to class, make the dean's list, run extra-curricular clubs, and still make it out to the bar once in a while? We were those guys. We've got nothing against hard work and earning our way. I'd argue that we're even rather good at it. … Being willing to work is absolutely USELESS if you can't get a foot in the door.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years ago I had dinner with Mike Duffy at the restaurant in the House of Commons in Ottawa. It was in early 2008. I was in Ottawa writing about CRTC hearings and talking to people who wanted to talk about the TV racket in Canada. Duffy was then anchoring his daily political chat show on the CTV News Channel. By the end of that year he was a senator.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was reminded of the occasion the other day. I was watching the news, flipping between CBC and CTV, and there was much coverage of two topics. One was Duffy's difficulties with the matter of his primary residence, and his promise to pay back monies he'd received. The other was the ongoing horse-meat scandal in Europe, which has revealed that many products labelled as “beef” are no such thing and often contain a lot of horse meat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It occurred to me that the two stories are connected, in a way. Both are about public trust and the matter of authenticity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is possible that Mike Duffy was deeply confused, as he says, by the forms he needed to fill out about his residence. Me, I can only smile and speculate that perhaps he looked away, down at his shoes, and missed something. That, as many of us will remember fondly, is how Mike Duffy became famous in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Duffy is a creature of Canadian TV, a type thrown up by the medium from obscurity to national fame. It doesn't happen so much now, but Duffy soared to prominence during a particular period. That was the early 1980s, when he reported from Ottawa for CBC TV, which had a vast audience for its news coverage and its competition was limited. There were no all-news cable outlets. It was from CBC's The National/The Journal package and CTV National News, and to a lesser extent Global News, that Canadians got their perspective on Ottawa politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Duffy was a different kind of TV reporter from the start. He had a presence, a persona for television that clicked with viewers. Roly-poly in appearance and talking in a cadence that suggested a down-to-earth Maritimer, he had this trick of pausing while speaking on-air and looking down, as if at his shoes. It was a good device, lending drama to the report. It helped make him popular. I can recall Duffy talking on CBC Radio's Morningside and Peter Gzowski declaring to him, “You're a star!” The gist was this: Here was this regular guy from PEI, who didn't look or talk like a slick TV news type, and he was popular with viewers. Duffy duly responded in a gee-golly-gosh manner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With his mastery of his on-air personality and the fame that brought him, he went to CTV and developed a refined version of that kind of persona – an Ottawa insider who retained some authenticity as a regular guy who happened to be a political junkie. It was that TV guy, the roly-poly, cheerful TV guy, who was made a senator. It was okay that the TV guy didn't live much in PEI. It isn't okay if the senator guy doesn't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What has happened in Duffy's troubles with housing expenses and eligibility to sit in the Senate troubles a lot of us. Last week, to his credit, Mike Duffy contacted CBC TV in PEI and tried to explain things. “Everywhere I go, people are talking,” he said. “Well where do you live? What's it all about? It's become a major distraction.” He also made clear he would voluntarily pay back living expenses related to the house he has in Ottawa. And that medical issues required him to be under the care of the University of Ottawa Heart Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said, “I hope it reassures Islanders and Canadians that the old Duff, the Duff they've known and trusted, would never do anything wrong. I would never knowingly fiddle anything.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the tone of TV reports these days suggest a general unease about the Senate, how it works and who sits there. There are some us who are especially uneasy about media figures taking Senate appointments. I am, as a journalist and a citizen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thing is, it occurs to me, the trajectory of Mike Duffy's success and eventual appointment to the Senate illuminates a truth about the Canadian media and TV in particular – the famous tend to gravitate toward power. There is a small media landscape here, especially in television, and once fame and success are achieved, a next, natural step is into the embrace of government. If you're looking to go upward, and stay on the national stage, it's one of the few directions available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Pamela Wallin, another media figure appointed to the Senate, has her own troubles explaining her expenses and multiple residences in Canada. You know, people say we don't have star system in Canada, but we sure do have some system of media fame that raises some TV types to the level of an elite who become part of the regime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was amusement in Canada when both Duffy and Wallin, familiar TV figures, were embraced by the government. Perhaps we're too easily amused by this. Perhaps, I put it to you, we should expect different from journalists who have achieved fame through television here. Isn't the principle of independent journalism diminished when we see people who have interviewed politicians and covered political stories then sit as appointed members of government? It is a human impulse to ask what we have been fed. And be uneasy about it.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upshot of the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>'s ruling upholding hate-promotion findings against an anti-gay pamphleteer in Saskatchewan is that human-rights commissions have the power to police newspapers, magazines and the Internet for material they consider hate-inducing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a dangerously vague standard on which to be limiting free speech. Justice Marshall Rothstein, writing for the court, said the mistake people make in applying hate-speech laws is to “focus on the nature of the ideas expressed, rather than on the likely effects of the expression.” This distinction – between offensive ideas and likely effects – is extremely difficult to apply. Perhaps he means that offensive ideas are okay, but not very offensive ideas.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The court apparently believes that hatred, like pornography, is something you recognize when you see it. It said the test for what induces hatred is an objective one, through a reasonable person's eyes. But reasonable people may disagree, as a look at the anti-gay pamphlets before the court shows. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal ruled that the material, though offensive (one pamphlet said “our children will pay the price in disease, death, abuse” for tolerance of homosexuality), was William Whatcott's attempt to take part in an important public debate, on the teaching of sexuality in the schools, and not something likely to cause hatred. As Mr. Whatcott said, the unsophisticated have a right to speak, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of the protections available in the Criminal Code hate-prohibition apply. Prosecution doesn't require an attorney-general's consent; a complaint from the public may be enough. No intent to spread hatred is required.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Supreme Court's pruning of Saskatchewan's Human Rights Code, to remove a section barring material that “ridicules, belittles or otherwise affronts the dignity,” helps somewhat. Wonderful satire of the kind written by the late Mordecai Richler could certainly have run afoul. But the powers of some human-rights commissions are still dangerous, as shown by a 2008 British Columbia hearing involving Mark Steyn's magazine article “The Future Belongs to Islam.” Though he was “exonerated,” it was a long, costly public battle of the sort that could have a chilling effect on free speech.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The marketplace of ideas, not human-rights commissions, should be where bad ideas, even hateful ones (short of those advocating or inciting violence), are beaten back.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story broke in the Seattle newspaper The Stranger, in a shocking article by Jen Graves about the artist Charles Krafft. Krafft has been a darling of art critics, and a hero of the U.S. West Coast art scene in particular, for years, known as a dark humorist. He has exhibited in New York and San Francisco, and his work has been discussed in The New Yorker, Harper's and Artforum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Krafft is best known for his ironic ceramics, which are made in classic 18th-century porcelain styles, yet are painted with images from 20th-century disasters and wars. Krafft calls them “Disasterware.” They include objects painted with scenes from the bombing of Dresden and the Hindenburg crash. Krafft also did a series of ceramic weapons – revolvers, assault rifles – decorated in traditional delft blue. He has also decorated objects with swastikas and has one teapot, now in a San Francisco museum, in the shape of Adolf Hitler's head. That teapot is labelled “Idaho” in Germanic script, and the work was titled Hitler Idaho by the artist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Krafft has up to now been seen as a social-critic postmodernist, mixing incongruous forms and irreverently making reference to the infiltration of the horrific in the cheapest of popular culture. His references to the Second World War have universally been described as anti-fascist. In fact, the Hitler Idaho teapot was bought by a Jewish patron with a collection on political themes. Salon magazine once said that his pieces “[force] the viewer to look at mankind's cruellest, most absurd behaviour in a way that penetrates the numbness induced by media overload.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What The Stranger's reporter discovered is that Krafft has contributed to a white nationalist forum called the White Network and has been making Holocaust-denying statements. Friends of the artist said that he is a conspiracy theorist with unpleasant biases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suddenly, all the pieces he has done with Nazi themes take on a troubling resonance. Is the Hitler-head teapot a serious commentary on the trivialization of Nazism? Is it just a tasteless joke? Or is it in fact a proud flaunting of Nazi affinities?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's worth pointing out that Krafft is not the only artist who has used Nazi imagery for shock value in art about contemporary culture. Similar praise has been heaped on Polish conceptualist Zbigniew Libera, who is best known for creating Lego models of Second World War concentration camps and photographing them to look like actual Lego products, complete with branded packaging. The results are eerily convincing; the point – something about commercialism – is murky. The Lego Concentration Camp series was eventually exhibited at the <span class="companylink">Jewish Museum in New York</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Israeli artist, Yael Bartana, who represented Poland at the Venice Biennale in 2011, made a trilogy of dramatic videos about a fictitious Jewish Renaissance Movement in Poland. The second part of this shows Jewish settlers building a “kibbutz” in Poland, which ends up looking exactly like a walled concentration camp. The work made troubling connections between Zionism and Nazism. People who took it literally were outraged. Libera also offended by meticulously recreating some famous 20th-century war photographs, recasting them as happy holiday snaps. The series was called Positives. One of those shows some healthy young men dressed as death-camp survivors, posed at a barbed-wire fence in an exact replica of a photo from a camp's liberation. The image is deliberately upsetting. Would it be less interesting if the artist went on record saying the art was merely his attempt to show that the Holocaust was a big joke?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Say he did. Say Krafft does. Buyers and admirers of Krafft's art are embarrassed because they gave the work a different interpretation from the artist's own. But since when did the artist's intention count for everything? And since when did an artist's hateful personality render his work invalid? (The idea that we should disparage Picasso's paintings because he was nasty to women has great traction right now, but it still hasn't forced the great museums to divest themselves of his work. We still read Ezra Pound and Yukio Mishima, too.) The fact is, the first interpretations of Krafft's work – as ironic juxtapositions, a commentary on popular culture – can still be eloquently argued. Interpretations must come from the work itself, not the statements floating around it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story is also a useful reminder to reporters that visual artists are rarely very good interview subjects. They are not an articulate bunch, as a whole – just look at their gobbledegook artist statements – and they often have very weird views about where their own art came from, ideas that don't seem to have made it into the work on display. The artist is, honestly, the last person I'd ask to explain any given work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's ignore Charles Krafft, the person, completely. He's a goof. His art is weirdly powerful, perhaps despite his intentions.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vengeance and anger should never guide a prison sentence. Still, a three-year sentence for the killing of four teenage football players and the injuring of a fifth in a fatal crash in Grande Prairie, Alta., is too lenient. It fails to send a strong enough message of denunciation and deterrence about the perils of drinking and driving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justice W.A. Tilleman said he felt obliged to accept the joint submission for three years from the Crown and the defence. However, a four-year sentence for Brenden Holubowich, 23, would still have been within the “normal” range for the crime of dangerous driving. That would at least have amounted to one year for each teenager who was killed. This way, as one of the mothers noted, it is just nine months, the length of time she carried her son in her womb.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In exchange for his plea of guilty to five counts of dangerous driving, 11 other charges against Mr. Holubowich were dropped, most of them for impaired driving. He admitted he had been drinking on Oct. 21, 2011, the night of the crash, but the court didn't hear his blood alcohol level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Holubowich was genuinely remorseful and has no criminal record. And the case against the apprentice mechanic had weaknesses. The car carrying the five members of a high-school football team had just made a U-turn on the highway to go in the opposite direction when he crashed into it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the horrifying circumstances moved even the judge to tears. Mr. Holubowich was driving his pick-up truck at 151 kilometres an hour in an 80-kph zone. The car was so mangled that the first responders believed there were only three people in it because two of the teenagers had been flung so far into the bush. Their families have all been utterly devastated; the car's only survivor, Zach Judd, has contemplated suicide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, Mr. Holubowich fled the scene, was arrested an hour later and had his blood alcohol tested hours later. That meant the Crown could not prove impairment at the time of the crash. If the judge really wanted to signal his zero-tolerance of drinking and driving, a stiffer sentence would still be in proportion with the crime. This was a lost opportunity.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE QUESTION</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having spent a number of months nurturing a new friendship with all the effort this entails, the inevitable always happens to me: My friend invites me to a “wellness seminar.” This turns out to be a network marketing scheme (usually involving expensive vitamins and food supplements) that they want me to join as a new customer/salesperson, to claim the rewards of signing me up. I realize these schemes are not necessarily illegal but they are morally repulsive to me so I always decline, politely of course. I simply don't want to join an organization where the product is always secondary to the selling network structure. Anyway, as a result, this causes an awkward situation between us and the friendship is often terminated. I am financially better off than most of my friends, but I don't think this entitles them to use our friendship for their own financial gain. How can I prevent this from happening to me repeatedly?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ANSWER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wait – what? Are you saying every time you make a new friend, they instantly try to sign you up to a “wellness” pyramid scheme, then freak out when you decline and end the friendship? Where are you hanging out and meeting new friends, the Bernie Madoff Supper Club?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Honey, darling, bubeleh, these are not your “friends.” They're flimflam artists, charlatans, mountebanks – damn, I spilled my mojito on my thesaurus, but you get the idea. Not friends. Not to be trusted. Certainly not to be given money – and don't sign any papers they hand you, especially not ones that say stuff like “power of attorney.” But let's say, for the sake of argument, the question is oddly put and we are indeed talking about less-well-off-than-you “friends” hitting you up for favours and/or, directly or indirectly, cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That I can relate to – well, not me personally, I've never had much money or influence or even the ability to get anyone a job. So people tend not to ask me for favours. (They might start, as a reflex, then catch themselves: “Hey, Dave, my cousin just graduated from – oh, uh, never mind.” Me: “What? Ask me anything!” Them: “Nah, it's okay.”)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I do have a couple of high-end friends who are in a position to do stuff such as hire people, lend them cash, whisk them off to fabulous cottages – even cast them in TV shows and movies. So they're constantly being asked to do these very things by everyone around them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take my friend who vice-presides over a vast retail conglomerate. Every day he gets calls, e-mails, in-person approaches from people asking favours to the effect of: “Hey, my cousin Sherry's 22-year-old daughter is full of vague, entitlement-rich aspirations of getting into fashion and retail, preferably in a senior management position with a large salary and a comprehensive benefits/bonus/travel package. Can she come to your office or ideally your house or even more ideally your cottage for the weekend some time soon to discuss when and where she can start?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I kid, of course. I exaggerate to amuse and entertain and to make a point. But it's not far off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, over time, I've noticed that this friend always does the same thing when faced with these types of requests. You should try it too. Maybe practise in front of a mirror first. Start by opening your mouth slightly, and, pressing your tongue to the top of your soft palate, make a humming sound through your nasal passage, like: “Nnnnnn … Nnnnnn …” Then form your mouth into a circle and push out some air, also with a sort of humming sound: “Ohhhh … Ohhhh …”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Practise putting these two actions together until you can do them in rapid succession, and it all comes out at once, in a single, short, sharp syllable: “Nnnn … ohhhh. No.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After uttering this syllable, you can add/embellish it with other verbiage of your own devising, e.g. “…thank you,” or “It's not a good time” or “I'm just too busy right now.” But really, when it comes to so-called friends inviting you to join their poncey Ponzi schemes, and who would “terminate the friendship” if you balk, I think the single syllable should suffice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Personally, I would add a couple of other syllables, in the form of a suggestion as to what they could do with their wellness-seminar brochures – but that's just me.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think you'll find, with practice, it's a syllable that becomes easier and easier to utter each time and can be both liberating and empowering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What am I supposed to do now?</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Double-bunking prisoners is not only expensive, it is risky. When inmates share cells, violence between inmates increases. This threatens the safety of guards, and ultimately endangers society by making it more difficult to rehabilitate offenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why a new directive from the Commissioner of the Correctional Service of Canada is so troubling. It has deleted the principle that “single occupancy accommodation” is the most desirable and correctionally appropriate way to house offenders.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The directive also increases the cap on the number of prisoners who should be double-bunked to 20 per cent from 10 per cent. In reality, as many as half of all cells are used for double-bunking in many federal penitentiaries in the Prairies and some in Ontario, including segregation cells (which you'd think would defeat the purpose).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Double-bunking doesn't just mean that sleeping capacity in a penitentiary is taxed; it also signifies that vocational opportunities, health services, support and family visits for prisoners are under stress. “Without access to programs, prisoners won't make progress and that ends up costing society more and harming society,” said Howard Sapers, the Correctional Investigator of Canada. “That creates a downward spiral.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation has the potential to only get worse, as the impact of Bill C-10, the Conservatives' omnibus crime bill, which rolled out mandatory minimums, including a six-month prison term for those convicted of growing six marijuana plants, is felt. Other legislation that reduces credit for pre-trial custody and makes it more difficult to get parole is also resulting in larger prison populations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an era of fiscal restraint, federal spending for prisoner accommodation is a growth area. Ottawa is building 2,700 more cells at a one-off cost of $630-million. Add this to the average annual cost of housing a federal offender: $113,000, compared with $29,500 for community supervision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem of double-bunking has been created by Ottawa's own policies. One way or another, we will all be sharing the costs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the impression that may have been left by the Idle No More movement, not all native leaders in Canada are waiting for the federal government to solve their problems.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If anything, the protests that dotted the landscape earlier this year highlight the growing chasm that exists between aboriginal leaders solely intent on pursuing historical grievances and a new breed that has little time for old fights and is instead focused on improving the lives of their people the old-fashioned way: through boldness and creativity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A growing number of aboriginal leaders – especially those blessed by geography – are unlocking the value of their lands in order to enter the economic mainstream,” says author Alex Rose. “New economic activities – LNG plants, mines, hydroelectricity, coal ports – represent a re-engagement with the modern world.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rose has written an upcoming book on this phenomenon entitled The New Power Brokers: Negotiating the High-Stakes Future of Aboriginal Lands and Resources. In it, he delves into the psyche of some of those native leaders who are redefining what aboriginal life means in Canada. People like Clarence Louie of the Osoyoos Indian band and Kim Baird of the Tsawwassen First Nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Louie assumed control of his band in the 1980s after it had declared bankruptcy and been taken over by Indian Affairs. Today, thanks to a thriving winery among other endeavours, the band reported revenue of $26-million for the last fiscal year, which included a profit of $2.4-million. Work has begun on a 360-cell correction facility that will be built on Osoyoos land. The various initiatives have meant full-time employment for hundreds of band members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Baird, meantime, negotiated the first urban treaty in B.C. in 2008, one that will unlock hundreds of millions of dollars in economic development potential. Tewanee Joseph is the charismatic spokesman for the Squamish First Nation of North Vancouver, a group that has parlayed valuable real-estate holdings into development riches. The announcement of first nations groups in northern B.C. partnering with private companies on an array of resource projects is now commonplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the process, the driven, pragmatic chiefs that are forging many of these deals are freeing their people from the grim fate that has defined aboriginal life in this country for 150 years. This new cohort of leaders has come to realize that the dire and unpleasant conditions on their reserves are no longer an unalterable precondition of living within the confines of the Indian Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“No one denies for one minute the devastating effect that the twin bulldozers of colonialism and residential schools have had,” says Mr. Rose. “But to a person, these new entrepreneurs reject the politics of victimization. They also reject the hated obsequies of going hat in hand to bureaucrats in high-rise towers at Indian Affairs.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which may be true, but neither are many of these leaders in a hurry to cut ties with Ottawa, given all the benefits. On one hand, they can operate like any independent town or municipality in pursuit of any business opportunity that comes along. On the other, they can still receive millions from the federal government and maintain tax-free status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Tewanee Joseph referred to his reserve as the ‘gilded cage,'” said Mr. Rose, who has written two previous books on aboriginal affairs in Canada. “There are just too many advantages that come with living there that the idea of ever leaving is hard.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And you wonder why there have been so few treaties signed in British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic transformation under way in many of these aboriginal communities is the most significant development we have witnessed in native affairs in Canada in generations. These modern aboriginal leaders reject the notion that thriving commercial enterprises and joint ventures with non-aboriginals will lead to assimilation and the eventual destruction of their way of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You're going to lose your language and culture faster in poverty than you will in economic development,” Chief Louie says in the book. “People can't protect their culture when they're on welfare. A culture of dependency leads to death.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘What I'm going to do is take my shoes off,” says Nigella Lawson as she approaches a small table where we will talk in a downtown Toronto event facility. “If I may,” she adds politely. She produces one of her signature little groans of pleasure as she plunks herself down and slips off her Christian Louboutin heels. Dressed in a purple clingy dress, she then curls herself into a lovely s-shape – a perfect pasta noodle on the fork of an angular chair.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There, that's a description of the famous foodie and cookbook author you've perhaps come to expect. She's a meal for cultural consumption. I know that's what I expected, based on the coverage she has had over the years and especially in the last couple of months, while on tour in North America and the U.K. for her new book, Nigellissima, a collection of Italian-inspired recipes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She became famous with her first TV cooking show, Nigella Bites, which came on the heels of her first two best-selling books, How To Eat and How To Be a Domestic Goddess in the mid-2000s. Now, though, she is served up as an entertainment all her own, a walking show of, well, let's call it, Nigella's Bits and Bites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inevitably, there's comment on her white alabaster skin, the curvy gourd of her figure. Biographical details are sprinkled in: the privilege of her background, and the tragedies, too. She is married to Charles Saatchi, one of the world's great admen and art collectors. Her father, Nigel Lawson, a former Conservative MP and Chancellor of the Exchequer, is now Lord Lawson of Blaby. Her mother, Vanessa, was heiress to a catering business fortune. Lawson attended Oxford and worked as assistant literary editor at The Sunday Times, a book reviewer – once judging the Booker prize – and also as a restaurant critic for The Spectator. By the time she was 40, she had grieved the untimely deaths of three loved ones: her sister Thomasina of breast cancer at 32; her mother of liver cancer at 48; and her first husband, John Diamond, a brilliant and popular columnist for The Times, of throat cancer at 47.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's missed in this over-processed boilerplate version of her biography, I can tell you, is her spontaneity. In person, Lawson is like being in the midst of an unpredictable weather system. You never know what will hit you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I always thought when I first started doing TV that it was my sister who died that I was speaking to,” she blurts as part of a reply to a question about how aware she is of the sexual nature of all that licking of fingers in her kitchen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Really? “Oh yes,” she says, never once turning away, her brown eyes steady and intense under big false eyelashes that have been expertly applied for all her appearances that day. “I needed someone who was on my wavelength. That's how I started. I thought about what I would say to Thomasina.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But surely, she is aware of her sexuality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You know what men are like,” she confides girlishly, tapping my knee. “They have this confidence, which I admire. They think everything is a come-on to them.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her late husband was the one who encouraged her to write about food. “He said, ‘You're funny, because you're not confident about a lot of things, but about food you are totally confident.' ” He was also the one who told her she was “a gay man trapped in a woman's body. I am camp to a fault.” While he was sick, she cooked and baked up a storm, a “terrible irony” that troubled her, she says, because he could only be fed intravenously. But, “I got comfort from being in the kitchen, and he liked it,” she offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conversation slides to her current husband, who is very private and doesn't like her to talk about him, she tells me before doing just that. “I use him as a sounding board. But I don't ask him, ‘Shall I put rosemary or thyme in this?' He wouldn't have a view.” He is “quite a fussy eater,” and a fastidiously tidy man. “You can't have two messy people in a marriage,” she jokes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He even helps her accept her age, now 53, in the context of her television career. “I think about it a lot,” she says, adding that she keeps her youthful looks by drinking lots of water and wearing the infamous “burkini” swimwear she was pictured in while on Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia, to protect her skin from the sun. “Charles says, ‘Who says you can't be an old bag on TV? You'll just be who you are.' He always says to me, ‘You're not some little starlet, you know. You are who you are. You cannot help but be that person.' ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She never plans what's ahead – not in life, not in an interview. She writes the books that “simmer up” in her mind. The idea for Nigellissima, which is more about the passionate relationship Italians have to food rather than simply the recipes, was always something she wanted to do after having spent time in Italy as a student. But it didn't come to fruition until now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Most of the important things in life aren't planned,” she explains. “You can't plan when you're going to fall in love and who you're going to fall in love with. And a lot of people plan to have children and don't,” says the mother of two teenagers from her first marriage. “And sadly, you have no control over death.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She lives by her instincts, which is her secret in the kitchen, too. “There's no right or wrong,” she says. “You have to know what you like. And you have to be able to taste something and know what you think it needs or whether you're pleased with it or not.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her recipes can give guidance. But she makes it clear that how your cake – and your life – turn out is up to you.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How Green Was My Valley, the novel by Welsh writer Richard Llewellyn, is about a young man born into a village of black air, of strikes, of deadly explosions. At the end, you're keen to accompany the hero, Huw Morgan, out of the coal mines.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 50 years earlier, Émile Zola had come to similar conclusions in Germinal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The novelists and filmmakers who adapted these two works for cinema focused on people – particularly the miners. They were sad, happy, passionate, defeated, pure, compromised, creative, dull, intelligent, stupid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is, alive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coal Miner's Daughter, Matewan and other stories, in novels and on screen, do not elevate coal mining into the higher reaches of human endeavour. Of course it's dirty. But the activity of putting on a helmet and walking every morning into a pit so the world can turn on its furnaces in winter and its lights at sundown is noble. It's something that thousands of interesting human beings do to help raise their children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the spring, President Barack Obama will make a decision about the Keystone XL Pipeline. It has transformed infrastructure into a symbol. Still, Canadian columnists, academics and politicians point out the hypocrisy of Americans, who derive so much of their electrical power from coal. Single American states produce nearly as many tons of carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants as do the oil sands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This analysis assumes that human beings make rational choices. It assumes that you can counter the power of a symbol with numbers and graphs and jargon. The difference between coal and oil sands is cultural and it's emotional. Human beings work in coal mines. Big trucks work in the oil sands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oil sands and the people who have made them the boiler room of Canada are amazing. It's a story of pioneers and risk-takers and scientists and crazies, who slowly and then very quickly transformed a mysterious tar into one of the largest fuel sources on the planet. The next wave of oil sands entrepreneurs will be devoted to environmental solutions. Yet from the beginning, energy companies, lobbying organizations and governments have ignored the characters in the story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the summer of 2006, the Alberta government and energy companies brought an exhibition to the National Mall in Washington to “tell the story” of this great resource. At that time, the environmental opposition to the oil sands was a fringe affair. For years, Canadian leaders had disputed climate science as a misinterpretation of “dinosaur farts” and had cast critics as smelly lunatics, greedy for donations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta did not tell the story of the oil sands in 2006. There was an enormous yellow dump truck and a tent with some facts and samples. I was there and I didn't hear a thing about oil sands people, oil sands characters, drama or conflict. Nothing about the individuals who lived in and around Fort McMurray – first nations and new immigrants – whose lives had changed so dramatically in less than a generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not suggesting that Syncrude and the Alberta government commission novelists and filmmakers to tell stories – even negative stories – about the people who live and love and die around the oil sands. But it's not a terrible idea. In a couple of months, the federal government will release its multimillion-dollar Responsible Resource Development campaign to convince Canadians, again, that our resource industry is important.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta government, the federal government and the <span class="companylink">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers</span> already have spent millions on careful, impersonal, boring campaigns to tell us what we all learned in junior high school: We carry water, we hew wood. We dig stuff up and we sell it, and if we didn't, we'd all be poor. I'm sure the music will be uplifting, and we'll no doubt hear words like innovative, responsible and sustainable. But Llewellyn and Zola would remind us these are abstractions, buzzwords. They will help as much as it helped when we called the oil sands ethical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've heard, endlessly, about James Cameron and the fuel he puts in his private jets and helicopters. He's a fraud, but he's a fascinating fraud. The truth is, we're all frauds. And there are some marvellous frauds, from the past and present and from our imaginations, who can tell the story of the oil sands with passion, with pride and shame, with conflict and confusion, with hope and with energy. And we might even believe them.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you were around 30 years ago, in February, 1983, one of the things you probably weren't doing was going to see The King of Comedy, Martin Scorsese's highly anticipated follow-up to 1980's Raging Bull.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, Scorsese couldn't bring himself to watch the film, which opened to almost immediate and total lack of interest. “I haven't seen it since I made it,” he told Richard Schickel in the 2011 volume Conversations With Scorsese. “It's too embarrassing.” While Scorsese clarified that the movie made him cringe, he said it wasn't because it was bad – although it did receive some of the more savage reviews of the year – but because it hit too close to home. He saw too much of himself in too much of it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The King of Comedy had its origins in the early 1970s, a fact that becomes more remarkable when you consider that its depiction of celebrity culture gone psycho-pathological – in the figure of Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro), a fan so driven to fame he kidnaps a talk-show host (Jerry Lewis) with a plan to ransom him for a standup spot – is now thought to be one of the more eerily prescient movies of its day. Today, the condition of fame-at-any-cost-Pupkinism is so ubiquitous as to be ambient, as common as <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and reality TV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To have imagined such a character in the early '70s, as Newsweek staff writer and movie critic Paul Zimmerman did when he managed to get his script into the hands of Scorsese's buddy De Niro, was an act of divine precognition. The walls between the famous and the rest of us were still more or less intact in those days, but Zimmerman saw the writing on them – and how, inevitably, they would be breached. Celebrity is all about desire, fantasy, projection and consumption, and it was only a matter of time before somebody like Pupkin saw no walls – and blew right through them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pupkin's defining characteristic is deluded grandiosity: He believes he should be as famous as his idol Jerry Langford (a wonderfully subdued and self-knowing Lewis), and his conviction is nothing short of a total eclipse of reason. Nothing will stop Rupert from getting what he wants; no amount of reason or abundant evidence to the contrary will compel him to see himself as he really is: an untalented thirty-something who lives in his mother's New Jersey basement with full-sized cutouts of Liza Minnelli and Jerry Langford as his imaginary talk-show guests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When De Niro read the script, his own fame was in almost vertical ascendance: Movies such as Bang the Drum Slowly, Godfather Part II and Scorsese's Mean Streets had spread the word of a new Brando in town. The otherwise fiercely private Method-oriented actor was quickly becoming a public sensation, so when he read the script, he saw something close to home, something looming every time he stepped outside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not so much Scorsese, who just didn't get it. As he told Schickel: “I thought the movie was just a one-line gag. You won't let me go on the show, so I'll kidnap you and you'll put me on the show. Hmm.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The director's relationship with the material changed as time passed and his own fame was established, giving him deeper appreciation of the Rupert phenomenon from both sides of the wall. Remembering his own obsession with movie stars and directors, and now meeting people who were obsessed with him, Scorsese knew what it was like to be both Jerry Langford and Rupert Pupkin, and while that prepped him to make The King of Comedy, it didn't make it easy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“By the time I got around to shoot it,” Scorsese told Schickel, “I found that I didn't like dealing with the story; it was so unpleasant and disturbing, it crossed so many lines that normally divide private and public lives.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Watched today, The King of Comedy electrifies on multiple currents. First, there is its unrestrained conviction that celebrity worship is a form of self-obliterating neurosis – no surprise to anyone who has watched an episode of Real Housewives or felt depressed by how few <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> followers they have. Second, there is its technique, a simultaneously TV-drab and nightmare-daring mode of filmmaking Scorsese hasn't indulged in since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is De Niro, the man who not only pushed Rupert Pupkin into big-screen being, but who possibly gave one of the most uncompromising and completely committed performances of an already formidable career: His Rupert is a miracle of unbridled sociopathic entitlement, a needy, unrelenting monster of unchecked narcissism – the kind of guy who is that much more frightening today only because he doesn't stick out so much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The King of Comedy would mark something of an end for the director and the actor, who did not work together for a another seven years (Goodfellas), and separately would never venture quite as far out on the edge as they did here. In a sense they didn't need to, considering how quickly the world caught up – and passed them.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How is it, the world might fairly ask, that the United States with all its brainpower and creativity can be so, well, stupid?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not stupid in everything, of course; perhaps not in much at all. But when it comes to governing themselves, Americans are making matters harder by a resolute determination not to face real facts. And those of us who live nearby will feel the effects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, U.S. politicians will face a fact – one that they arbitrarily created, something called “sequestration.” This word, like so much about what happens in the <span class="companylink">U.S. Congress</span>, has an unreal quality but very real consequences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Sequestration” means action caused by lack of action; namely, that when Congress in 2011 set about trying to cut the federal deficit, it decreed that in the event of failure, mandatory cuts totally $1.2-trillion would be imposed over 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those cuts begin today: $85-billion of them touching equally the military and domestic programs. What happens is simple: The Treasury will not issue departments money for which they had budgeted, so the departments will be scaling back. And that will mean fewer services – for border service agencies, air traffic control, meat inspection, national parks, just about everything the U.S. government does.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This across-the-board method of cutting is nuts, the antithesis of proper budgeting. You might even argue that given persistently high unemployment, fewer cuts should be made now but larger ones later, if and when the economy is stronger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter. When arbitrary deadlines require ill-considered measures, the results are predictable chaos, inconvenience, lack of preparation and, of course, endless name-calling and finger-pointing as to who is responsible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is as it has been in Washington for some time now between the Obama administration and the majority Republicans in the House. There have been crises over the “fiscal cliff,” the “debt ceiling” and now “sequestration.” Ratings agencies have already downgraded U.S. notes. And the world is looking on with a mixture of exasperation and apprehension as the world's leading power inflicts additional wounds upon itself, to the point where one might ask: With a political system like this, reflecting a people who love their country but cannot agree on how to govern it sensibly, who needs enemies?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Sequestration,” accompanied by the now-familiar rhetorical Sturm und Drang, is not the beginning of the end but the end of the beginning, to borrow a phrase, because the nation's debt is now so high, its deficits so large (declining in the next three years but set to rocket thereafter), and its politics so poisonous and paralytic, that further crises around the same fiscal issues are assured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The raw, real facts are these: The federal budget deficit will be $845-billion this year, which is 5.3 per cent of GDP. That will be the first budgetary deficit less than $1-trillion in five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deficit, according to the Congressional Budget Office, will head down to a manageable 2.4 per cent of GDP by 2015, but then start soaring again owing to an aging population, rising health-care costs and growing interest payments on the national debt. By 2023, if current laws remain in place, the <span class="companylink">CBO</span> says, debt will equal 77 per cent of GDP and be on an upward trajectory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps like politicians everywhere, U.S. politicians prefer to punt the problem rather than tackle it. So they invent slogans. They create bipartisan commissions whose recommendations they ignore. They (and their media supporters) shout incessantly at each other. They make mini-decisions, putting off the hard ones until another self-imposed deadline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has to be a mixture of tax increases and spending restraint to stabilize and then improve the fiscal situation. That was the message of two bipartisan commissions; that's the opinion of most economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans talk about eliminating or curtailing tax deductions, but flee when asked about when, how and by how much. Democrats see no spending program they do not believe essential. And no interest group has ever benefited from a program for which a rationale for continuation could not be invented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so the Great Republic meets another arbitrary fiscal deadline from which it (and friends) will suffer because political actors are paralyzed by ideological certainties that shield them from facts.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">European Parliament</span> in Brussels is usually more of a talking-shop than an initiator. At the instigation of Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian Green member, however, it has unwisely amended a new set of <span class="companylink">European Union</span> banking regulations, in a way that threatens to hobble the operations of London's financial district, known as the City. The change would restrict banks' ability to pay bonuses to their employees – no other financial centre in Europe is large enough to be seriously affected. Until now, the EU has never passed financial regulations to which Britain objected.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The amendment, not yet definitively enacted, would forbid banks to pay bonuses more than equal to an employee's fixed salary, with a couple of partial exceptions that would have to be ratified by cumbersome shareholder resolutions. It would almost compel banks to overcompensate many of their employees; they might well feel it necessary to approximately double salaries, reducing the variable element that gives an incentive for bringing profits that benefit the banks and their shareholders. Some firms might even try to set much higher salaries, and then turn around and penalize employees by “clawing” them back if they do not meet targets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, is right to stand up for the City, saying, “This is possibly the most deluded measure to come from Europe since [the emperor] Diocletian tried to fix the price of groceries across the Roman Empire.” The emperor's price-control edict, issued in 301, was actually not confined to groceries, and was mercifully abandoned after a few ineffective years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this EU measure would have effects in an area much larger than the Roman Empire, because it would reach British banking operations overseas – for example, in New York, Toronto and Hong Kong. Employees there might well start looking for jobs in non-British-owned banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lamberts' amendment was needlessly tacked on to the EU law implementing the international Basel III standard on bank regulatory capital. A Green in Brussels, he is also a member of a Belgian party called the the Écologistes Confédérés pour l'Organisation de Luttes Originales (Confederated Ecologists for the Organization of Original Struggles), a name that does not promise much economic expertise.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last day of February served as a reminder that, regardless of the sexy moves a major-league team makes in the off-season, there is still a gradualness to the whole spring-training process, that the men-at-work aspect of the game must still be played out.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Toronto Blue Jays</span> used their first defensive shifts of the spring against Mark Teixeira and Travis Hafner in Thursday's 1-0 win over the <span class="companylink">New York Yankees</span> at George M. Steinbrenner Field. Toronto manager John Gibbons made it clear that he will be less doctrinaire in his approach to the shift compared to his predecessor, John Farrell, and former third base and infield coach Brian Butterfield. Gibbons said much will depend on how that day's starter feels about the shift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This year they've made it clear we'll have some say in it,” Thursday's starter, Brandon Morrow, said. “They want some input. I'm comfortable with it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday, Mark Buehrle took aside Ricky Romero and showed him a new cut fastball grip, then oversaw a throwing session in which Romero ran out the new grip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a lot that goes on away from the batting cage, you know?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Esmil Rogers, the pitcher the <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span> acquired from the <span class="companylink">Cleveland Indians</span> in return for Mike Aviles (whom Toronto acquired from the <span class="companylink">Boston Red Sox</span> in the Farrell trade), was pulled aside early in camp by Jose Bautista, who told Rogers he thought he could pick up his pitch by the way he flared his glove.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rogers now holds the glove behind his ear instead of in front when he brings the ball into the mitt, in order to hide his pitches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's left Rogers “in between” mechanically, in the words of bullpen coach Pat Hentgen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And even though knuckleballer R.A. Dickey won the National League Cy Young Award in 2012, the <span class="companylink">Washington Nationals</span> as a team hit .283 against him (30-for-106) with six doubles and three home runs. Dickey was 2-2 against the Nationals. Veteran Mark DeRosa, who played for the Nationals last season and is with the <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span> now, had one of those six doubles because the Nationals, in his words, “had his pitches.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in spring training, he mentioned the matter to Hentgen “and all those guys.” They watched video of Dickey pitching, and in DeRosa's words, “It was obvious what he was doing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dickey, according to Hentgen, immediately addressed the issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A younger Hentgen did the same thing when <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span> teammate Roberto Alomar came up to him one day and asked him to go for a walk in the outfield, where he showed Hentgen how he was tipping one of his pitches. Alomar suggested Hentgen hold his glove differently when he reached in to grip the ball – more like Jack Morris or Dave Stewart. A little lower, closer to the waist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Obviously, it didn't hurt R.A. that much because he won a Cy Young Award,” DeRosa, the 25th man on the <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span> roster, said. “And, you know, I didn't want to tell him about it at first because of the success he had. I didn't want him thinking about it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DeRosa, of course, won't reveal how Dickey tipped his pitches. And laughed when asked why the Nats noticed it and others didn't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have no idea,” DeRosa said. “I'm not a big guy who steals signs or looks for tips necessarily. Ninety per cent of the time, if a guy does say something, I'll take a look at it on tape and brush it off if it's not blatant. That's really not something I want to get involved in. But it was just that I felt that we [the Nationals] had every pitch he threw.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Doesn't mean we could hit it, but we had it, and I had better success than I should have had, so it was really one of the first things I wanted to address with him. Plus, I'd played with him before. I knew he would take it the right way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's one of those things where you're my teammate now, and everybody's looking for an edge,” De Rosa said. “Everybody wants to win.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keep that in mind as the <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span> play out the Grapefruit League schedule, with several regulars leaving camp for the World Baseball Classic. It's the process that counts, not the results, and in the early going, the process has been impressive. There really is a lot that goes on.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may be tough as you age to consider that you've been doing any one thing for 25 years, but in Joe Laughlin's case, he recognized, perhaps after some initial reluctance, that it was something to be celebrated. The beloved and respected Vancouver choreographer – who made his professional debut as a choreographer 25 years ago – marks the anniversary next week with Retrospective: 25 Years , a program of three works at the Vancouver International Dance Festival.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on the history of these works – and an afternoon in the rehearsal hall – I would suggest it is not to be missed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Laughlin, who owes his career in dance to an accident (more on that in a moment), can attribute this program to, if not quite an accident, some well-timed inspiration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a year ago, Mr. Laughlin, now 51, was embarking on a new full-length work at around the same time he was reading Twyla Tharp's The Creative Habit: Learn It and Use It for Life. He came across a passage about institutional memory. “She was talking about … the inherent power in looking back,” Mr. Laughlin said at the Dance Centre this week. “We always think to be cutting-edge. We have to be going forward, but there's something valuable about looking back into the past.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It occurred to him that he has made 11 full-length works and some 50 others, but had never brought anything back. “Maybe I need to rediscover myself,” he thought. “Maybe I don't know myself. And maybe if I do that, it'll help me go forward if I reconnect with myself, personally and artistically.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Laughlin was trained as a gymnast in Calgary. When he was 20, a tumbling pass gone wrong meant ligament surgery on his ankle and weeks in a cast. On the advice of a choreographer at his gym, he limped into a dance class, and – after pliés and other dance moves – he was able to do a cartwheel, and walk out. Beyond the healing ankle, something stirred in him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He became a professional dancer and later a choreographer, forming his company, Joe Ink, in 1995. Along the way, he has learned from some of the greats – Judith Marcuse, Lola McLaughlin – and has also helped develop some of the greats in a new generation of Vancouver choreographers: Amber Funk Barton, Tara Cheyenne Friedenberg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He creates this atmosphere of creativity for his dancers that is really potent and gives a lot of permission to be creative,” said Ms. Friedenberg, who worked with Mr. Laughlin in The Body Remembers in 2002. “He's so supportive and so open to the messy stuff of art-making. It's hard and vulnerable and he's so generous with it and so open himself that, as a dancer, you just fall in love with him and with the process. And also, as an artist, I felt like it gave me permission to find my own voice in a way that I hadn't before.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Retrospective, Mr. Laughlin has selected three works, dating back to 1997's Harold, Billy, Stan and Jack – which Mr. Laughlin refers to as “The Four Guys.” The lighthearted work was inspired in part by a vintage photograph of his father and three uncles sitting on a couch wearing zoot suits, their legs crossed. The athletic work – there's a fair bit of couch jumping – features four female dancers dressed as men, set to film noir music.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's followed by Left, a 2003 solo work originally danced by Mr. Laughlin, which he calls a pas de deux for a man and his teacup. Mr. Laughlin created the work after spending time in South Africa. The tea cup became a symbol for ritual, and the rituals of a foreign culture imposed on an unwilling host – England in Africa. “That cup, it represented value and power to me,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most recent work on the program is 2011's dusk, an emotional piece created after Mr. Laughlin had a heart attack – he was just 47 – and when his friend Lola McLaughlin was dying. “In that six-month period, I survived and I got better and she battled cancer … and she didn't. And I had a hard time reconciling that,” he said. “I was hoping that I could translate that emotional experience that I had had into physicality that then would touch people in some way, that they would carry a response to that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he prepares for this retrospective, Mr. Laughlin – who is warm, funny and genuine, but also rigorous in the studio – has become somewhat introspective. Life has changed since the heart attack. “I don't do things I don't want to do. I don't go around toxic people. If I don't want to do it, I say no. … I don't get stressed. I pick my battles.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's certainly not done with dance. In fact, he's excited about his next endeavour: creating work for older bodies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In dance, it's all about these young bodies in space. And there's an irony in that because, when you've fully matured, and you're kind of at the height of your powers, your body starts to disintegrate. But your emotional and experience and all that life is really kind of vivid and potent. I'm interested in seeing what that's all about.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credibility has been an issue for the <span class="companylink">Calgary Flames</span> for some time now. But before Friday, most of the credibility questions revolved around the uncertain organizational path of an NHL team that generally does little more than tread water.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Flames haven't been good enough to make the playoffs for the past three seasons, but they haven't been bad enough to earn a high draft choice either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People wonder: Where is the plan? What is the future? And wouldn't it be nice to have even a single high-end prospect along the lines of Ryan Nugent-Hopkins or Tyler Seguin, so there's a glimmer of hope for tomorrow?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Thursday, the Flames took a bold step to strengthen their lineup in the here-and-now by signing restricted free-agent forward Ryan O'Reilly to an offer sheet – a rare event in the NHL old boy's club, where teams generally keep their hands off other people's property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That the Flames tried to poach O'Reilly away from a divisional rival was controversial for two reasons: One, they offered him a lot more money than the <span class="companylink">Colorado Avalanche</span> wanted to pay him – $10-million (U.S.) over two years. And two, they were prepared to surrender first- and third-round draft choices as compensation, had their bid for his services been successful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't. Colorado matched the offer – and that appeared to be the end of it, a 24-hour sensation, here today, gone tomorrow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is, until Friday, when Sportsnet hockey reporter Chris Johnston skimmed the memorandum of understanding (MOU) that passes for a new collective agreement these days, and discovered the Flames had potentially made an egregious error in their pitch to O'Reilly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because O'Reilly had played two games in the Russia-based KHL for Magnitogorsk following the Jan. 19, 2013, start of the shortened NHL season, the Flames would have been obliged to offer O'Reilly on waivers if they'd won the bidding for his services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or at least, that is the official NHL interpretation of events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Flames offered a different take on the matter, issuing their own statement Friday, saying their view of “the transition rules governing restricted free agents was, and continues to be, different than the NHL's current interpretation.” The Flames were “prepared to advance our position with the NHL,” but conveniently no longer had to “in light of Colorado's having matched the offer sheet. It is now an academic point.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, okay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Flames could have advanced their position with the NHL's legal minds until they were blue in the face, but if they'd lost the argument, it would have been a catastrophic blunder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think about how embarrassed the Flames would have been under that scenario – surrendering two draft choices to Colorado as compensation for signing O'Reilly, and then losing him immediately to, likely the 30th place <span class="companylink">Columbus Blue Jackets</span>, on waivers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would have constituted a firing offence for general manager Jay Feaster, even if he were to argue there is room for interpretation in the new and complex rewording of the NHL waiver rules – and how they apply to players returning in-season from Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That the Flames went merrily down this path without first getting the matter clarified by the NHL's hockey operations department represents a grievous oversight. You cannot take this sort of a significant, far-reaching step without due diligence, new CBA or not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, the Flames narrowly averted a disaster. The only ill effect was it placed a team – sputtering near the bottom of the standings again – in the limelight for all the wrong reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short-term, the storm will likely blow over. Long-term, you wonder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mulligans may be fine in golf, but the world of professional sport rarely offers up a lot of do-overs before heads start to roll.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the start of a general election campaign just over 10 weeks away, the Liberal government of Premier Christy Clark is in a state of upheaval.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A wide swath of her caucus is furious with the Premier over her handling of a leaked memo outlining what was widely viewed as a cynical and desperate ploy by her government to woo ethnic voters. The fact that the Premier did not seem to understand how badly the strategy made the Liberals look was one thing. But that she had a minister deliver an apology for the mess on her behalf has angered cabinet members and backbenchers even more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid this uproar, there is growing concern inside the Liberal camp over another controversy involving cabinet ministers Shirley Bond and, to a much greater extent, Pat Bell. New documents obtained by The Globe and Mail contradict denials by the two ministers that they were inappropriately involved in the procurement process for a multimillion-dollar contract in their riding of Prince George.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some members of the Liberal caucus want to see Mr. Bell step aside from cabinet until this matter can be properly looked into by an independent investigator. The Premier, meantime, has not expressed any concern over the matter and, rather, has backed her two cabinet colleagues unreservedly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the matter that has Liberals MLAs most upset at the moment is the Premier's entirely tone-deaf response to the leaked ethnic strategy memo. Under the proposed plan, taxpayer-funded resources were going to be used for party purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The names of members of the ethnic community who showed up for public events were to be compiled and supplied to the Liberals for possible election purposes. And perhaps most disdainful of all, the document outlined a scheme to acknowledge historical wrongs as a way to score a “quick win” with specific ethnic communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan was sent out under the name of the Premier's deputy chief of staff, Kim Haakstad, probably the most trusted member of the Ms. Clark's staff and undoubtedly her closest confidant. Many inside the Liberal ranks believed this couldn't end without Ms. Haakstad's resignation – and late Friday, they got it. And there could be more to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Ms. Clark spent much of Thursday playing down the intent of the memo, members of her own cabinet were hatching a plan to publicly apologize for it. It would appear that apology was forced on the Premier, which may be why she felt it not important to cancel a meeting with the editorial board of a Vancouver newspaper so she could deliver the expression of regret herself. Instead, she had Rich Coleman stand in the legislature and read it and then answer questions from the media afterwards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was an appallingly bad decision by Ms. Clark, one in which she completely abdicated her responsibilities as Premier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One has to wonder who is giving the Liberal Leader advice these days. She was not in Victoria on Wednesday when the leaked document was first revealed by the NDP, nor was she there on Thursday when the issue blew up and set off a firestorm inside her own caucus. Surely, someone looking out for her interests might have said to her: “Premier, you may want to get back here ASAP because you have a brewing rebellion on your hands.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now we have a situation where Liberal backbenchers are talking privately about deposing her as leader. There is genuine concern that Ms. Clark, given the trajectory the party seems to be on, could run the Liberals completely into the ground, leading to a virtual wipeout of the party in the May 14 election. The name of onetime Liberal leadership candidate George Abbott has been bandied around as someone who the caucus might agree to rally around as a replacement for Ms. Clark. He is also someone with the kind of stature needed if there is any hope of changing the current dynamics enveloping the governing party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Liberals MLAs are being openly contemptuous of the Premier. When one saw a reporter reading a copy of a Vancouver morning tabloid whose front page was devoted to the ethnic strategy debacle and carried a picture of an ethnically garbed Premier with her hands clasped in prayer, he remarked: “She should be praying.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Clark's caucus would seem to be divided into three camps: supporters, dissidents and a third group comprised of those who aren't running again and have mostly checked out. They are just glad they aren't seeking the support of the electorate at a time when their party hasn't had a good-news day in a couple of years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of leaks coming out of the government ranks is also a sign of general unrest and unhappiness. It is a phenomenon that often dogs governments on their way out of power. The same thing happened to Social Credit in 1990-91 and to the NDP in 2000. It must be infuriating to Ms. Clark because she seems to be powerless to stop it, no matter how much she may rant about it privately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Clark is expected to be back in the provincial capital on Monday. She will have some explaining to do with her caucus, some fires to put out. But it's also likely that she will signal her intent to fight on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who are hoping Ms. Clark will step aside for the good of the party clearly don't know her. She is a scrapper. She believes that she can turn things around, even in the face of ever-mounting evidence that suggests the task is all but impossible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It appears she is prepared to go down with the ship. And increasingly it looks like that's exactly what will happen.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question What are the must-sees in Norway?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many potential travellers, under-the-radar Norway means little more than fjords, fisherman's sweaters and Edvard Munch's The Scream. But it's this blank-slate unfamiliarity that makes the Scandinavian home of almost five million an exotic lure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oslo, of course, is the arrival point for most. But after hitting the capital's surfeit of cultural attractions – including must-sees like the Akershus Fortress, National Gallery, Ibsen Museum and the Munch Museum – it's time to spread your wings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.K. expat David Nikel agrees and blogs about his experiences at lifeinnorway.net.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, he suggests heading south to mountain-ringed Lillehammer, host of the 1994 Winter Olympics. Hub of a popular hiking region, the town's Norwegian Olympic Museum is a highlight. “It makes you wonder how a place so small could have hosted the Games,” says Nikel, whose second suggestion is Roros, a celebrated old-town charmer lined with painted wooden homes that's like stepping back in time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirdly, he proposes Tromso. “It's the undisputed cultural capital and party town of northern Norway – try Mack, the locally brewed lager.” Consider timing your visit for July's Bukta Festival, an outdoor live music event that takes full advantage of Tromso's midnight-sun season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Norway's dramatic, fjord-striped landscapes are at least as enticing as its towns. Nikel suggests heading north to the Lofoten Islands in the Arctic Circle. “The archipelago is home to moose, sea eagles, otters and puffins, all set around a beautiful coastline,” he says. Accessible by bridges, boats and buses, the islands are ideal for leisurely hiking and biking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'd also add the breathtaking ferry ride along the Geirangerfjord in the west of Norway. Keep in mind, this is a very popular excursion and the boats are often packed during the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If time is tight, Nikel advises flying to your destinations “since the geography makes all other transport slow.” He recommends keeping costs down with the summertime-only Explore Norway Ticket from domestic airline Wideroe (wideroe.no), with unlimited flights for two weeks from $502 (2,775 Norwegian krone).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if you're on a more laid-back timetable, take the train. Handy passes and discounted advance Minipris tickets are available via nsb.no, while the network stretches to many of Norway's main highlights. The scenically spectacular Oslo to Bergen train “is an absolute must,” says Nikel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bonus is it delivers you to one of Europe's most beautiful cities. Bergen, on the west coast, combines historic architecture – especially the achingly lovely Bryggen area – with a local feel that's more intimate than Oslo. Arsty, charming and quirky, Norway's second city is worth a few days. Don't miss the Bergen Art Museum and consider the eclectic out-of-town Norwegian Knitting Industry Museum, especially for its gift shop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Communication is rarely a problem for tourists. “You'll find no language issues in Norway, as everyone speaks great English,” Nikel says, adding a couple of additional insider observations: “Most shops are closed on Sundays, and opening hours are drastically reduced during July's vacation month.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's 18 metres long and these days it's hanging from the rafters at Mass MoCA, in North Adams, Mass., the signature work in the sprawling Oh, Canada exhibition, which winds up just over a month from now: a latex skin that has been cast from the interior and exterior of a lighthouse in Borden-Carleton, PEI, and then reconstructed as a sculptural installation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its creator, NSCAD University faculty member Kim Morgan, has taken a stubborn physical object and translated it into something semi-transparent and airborne, a phantom of the original. Range Light expresses a regional specificity, and can be seen as an anti-monument to a disappearing way of life along the Atlantic seaboard.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it also demonstrates the artist's sophisticated understanding of international contemporary art – drawing upon precedents from the latex forms of feminist icon Eva Hesse to the soft sculptures of Claes Oldenburg and the Dada influences to which he is heir. As a culturally hybrid object, then, Range Light is equal parts salted cod and Duchamp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work is also emblematic of the school where Morgan teaches, which has been, since the late sixties, Canada's most illustrious art school, and the only one with an indisputable international reputation. Almost half of the artists in Oh, Canada have passed through NSCADU's doors, either as teachers or students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Whether you are looking at current or historic practise,” says Mass MoCA curator Denise Markonish, “there's just no beating it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the school is embroiled in a crisis as it embarks on a search for a new president, facing as well the threat of a provincially mandated amalgamation with one of the region's universities – Dalhousie is looking to be the likeliest candidate – while also wrestling with a $17.4-million accumulated debt. (Dalhousie's, for the record, sits at $106-million.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing should be made plain: Something very precious is at stake. Since the late sixties, when the leadership of the school passed to artist Garry Neill Kennedy and his circle of conceptual-art colleagues (many of them coming out of the trail-blazing California Institute of the Arts and other leading-edge art programs in the United States), NSCAD has functioned as a vibrant fulcrum between the U.S. and European capitals of culture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is where German artist Joseph Beuys came to give his famous lectures in 1976 (the blackboard he used is now in the collection of the <span class="companylink">Art Gallery of Ontario</span>); where Los Angeles conceptual artist John Baldessari made his famous lithograph I Will Not Make Any More Boring Art at the famed NSCAD Press in 1971; where fledgling American painter Eric Fischl reintroduced figurative painting to a new generation; and where revered senior figures such as British-born conceptualist Eric Cameron, Canadian videomaker Jan Peacock and painter Gerald Ferguson have rubbed shoulders with younger talents like Micah Lexier, Kelly Mark, Susanna Heller, Steve Reinke, and the sculpture duo Hanson and Sonnenberg, to electrifying effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this alongside one of the liveliest crafts programs in the country, captained by the likes of ceramicist Walter Ostrom. “Head, Heart, and Hand” is the motto of the school, and its legacy bears this out, with artists demonstrating a singular devotion to the making of things, the ethics of artistic endeavour, and the avant-garde art history they inherit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic “efficiencies” that might prevail postamalgamation would likely file the edge off this excellence. A good business model can mean bad pedagogy. With fewer teachers per student comes less mentoring. With less physical real estate comes less studio space for developing ideas outside of class time. With fewer departments and course offerings comes less intellectual cross-pollination. Without much outcry, the school could become a husk as ghostly as Morton's floating lighthouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At last Sunday's Academy Awards ceremony, another NSCADU triumph slipped by under the radar: John Kahrs's win for best animated short, for his film Paperman. A member of the college's class of 1990, Kahrs works for Pixar in Los Angeles, carrying the NSCADU creative spore to farther shores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rest of Canada and the world continue to feel the impact of this rarified and singular place – a fragile ecosystem, but one worth fighting for and funding well. Let's hope the province of Nova Scotia and its leading citizens feel the same.</p>

This tiny grocery and noodle counter began as a community project 18 months ago, when owner Michael Leung canvassed the neighbourhood and held a vote to determine the use and name of the 600-square-foot space. Now leased by Andrea Carlson (former executive chef at Bishop's and proprietor of the coming Burdock &amp; Co. restaurant), the shop is stocked with locally made products (Sapadilla's plant-derived household cleaners), artisan foods (Beta5 chocolates, Mellifera Bees cardamom-infused honey, puttanesca Sugo Sauce) and requested staples (almond milk, canned tomatoes, etc.). Fresh produce can be purchased à la carte or packaged into bi-weekly Community Supported Agriculture shares that include organic fruit and vegetables from local farms, grains, heirloom legumes and cool surprises (a recipe for nettle-hazelnut pesto was tucked into last week's box). Go for the excellent ramen. But don't leave without a scoop, or jar, of Earnest salted caramel ice cream. It's decadently creamy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">237 Union St., 604-779-3804.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">theparkervancouver.com</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new addition to Vancouver's blossoming vegetarian restaurant scene, the Parker punches above its size (20 seats) while keeping its waste weight astonishingly low (about one pound a month). The lack of trash is achieved by sourcing seasonal products from local farmers without any throwaway packaging. Truth be told, there's probably no room to store any additional garbage. The open kitchen is a 60-square-foot corner nook that looks like a prep station at the end of the bar. Working within such narrow quarters, chef/owner Jason Leizert produces some surprisingly voluptuous small plates for his daily changing menu – velvety chickpea fritters; zingy Brussels sprouts garnished with walnuts, onions and crème fraiche; and a moan-inducing carrot cake slathered with salty butterscotch. Co-owner Steve Da Cruz (they worked together at Corner Suite Bistro De Luxe) shakes up masterfully meaty cocktails. Do try the Precious Twin (tequila and quince purée with pumpkin seed dust rimming the glass). The familiar plywood and mirrored decor, which often looks cold and unfinished in larger spaces, feels warm and cozy here. Great for date nights.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This isn't the best Mediterranean tapas fare in town. The tomato-cucumber fattoush salad could use more sour tanginess to brighten its toasted flatbread. The Moroccan lamb meatballs in spicy tomato sauce are just a wee bit dense. But this high-ceilinged loft space is such a lovely little spot in which to lean back and watch a flock of origami paper cranes drifting above the bar. The classic cocktail and craft beer offerings compare to some of the city's better known boîtes. And the restaurant, owned by sisters Maureen Webb and Donalda Weaver, has a great raison d'être. All proceeds go toward supporting the sisters' other local venture, Project Limelight, a non-profit society that offers free theatre arts programs for youth who live in the Downtown Eastside. Bravo.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">thepieshoppe.ca</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no such thing as too much pie. At this adorable cubbyhole, pie is the only item, other than coffee, on the menu. The niche selection doesn't make it any easier to choose from classic apple, chocolate pecan, blackberry-apple and the wonderfully tart raspberry rhubarb. Flaky crusted and sprinkled with sugar, the fresh pies (sold whole or by the slice) are baked daily by owners Stephanie and Andrea French. The two sisters also own Panoramic Roasting Company. Their small-batch single origin coffee, roasted at a rooftop studio in Kitsilano, is brewed to order in single cups by Aeropress or manual pour-over. Get there early. The shop opens at 11 a.m. and closes when the pies run out.</p>

What follows is the conversation that may have taken place some time after the news conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregor Robertson: Hey Stephen! How's it goin'? I thought that went well. You?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Toope: Yeah, yeah. Good. I thought so too. Nice work. You looked great. We made a pretty good business case, I think. And I liked the way you pulled out that $2.8-billion number. Where did you get that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robertson: Oh that. Yeah. The number comes from the Provincial Transit Plan in 2008. Meggs dug it out for me. I don't know if you remember. Kevin Falcon said the province was going to spend $14-billion on transit by 2020? As if, eh? $2.8-billion is what they said a Rapid Transit Line to UBC was gonna cost. I love that Meggs remembers all of that stuff. So have you heard anything back from the province yet?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toope: Not a peep. You?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robertson: Nada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toope: You think they would have jumped at the numbers. I mean, 150,000 more people living or working in the Broadway Corridor in the next 30 years. That's a lot of jobs. These guys are supposed to be all about the jobs, aren't they? I guess, though, to be fair, they've had a pretty brutal week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robertson: I'll say. Do you think it's anything to do with the kinds of jobs?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toope: I thought about that. You mean like tech, and life-sciences, and stuff? I know, you're right. It's not exactly the sort of thing they're pushing these days. I don't know, maybe they put that stuff in the same category as the movie business. I'll tell you, if there was any chance of finding shale gas while digging a subway tunnel you know they'd be all over this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robertson: (Long pause) Could there be?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toope: Be what?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robertson: Shale gas down there – under Broadway? I mean, I'm no geologist or anything but the stuff is everywhere. Isn't it just a matter of pumping enough water and sand and chemicals deep enough into the ground and boom, Bob's your uncle – the gas comes out?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toope: Uh, I think it might be a little more complicated than that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robertson: No, stay with me here, Steve. What if we made this the LNG-LRT? We're talking about a 12-kilometre-long tunnel here. We sink a well every few hundred metres, use the tunnel to transport the gas…</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toope: …and what? Perhaps build a liquefaction plant out on Wreck Beach?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robertson: Exactly!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toope: Can we actually do this? I mean, what about the environment? You know, tap water lighting on fire, that kind of thing. Not to mention earthquakes and the Wreck Beach Preservation Society. We'd have to dredge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robertson: Of course we're not going to actually do it! We just say we're going to do it to get the province to buy in. We pitch it as the first of its kind in the world. A combined LRT/LNG facility, “The Energy To Move People” or the “FRAC-Line” or something like that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toope: I like where you're headed with this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robertson: We'll say “Clean Energy,” though. Sounds better. Is there a way we can actually power the trains with this stuff? Maybe make up some kind of neighbourhood utility?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toope: I'll get my people to look at that. Here's the best part, though – $2.8-billion is chump change to Sinopec or Shell or <span class="companylink">Gazprom</span>. They'll easily finance half of it if we call it exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robertson: I'm excited. I'm feeling this. Wow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toope: Me too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robertson: I say we start with the graphics. Draw up a glossy brochure. I'll get staff to drop what they're doing and work on this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toope: I'll get my guys to work up some spreadsheets. This isn't going to look desperate or crazy, is it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robertson: Are you kidding?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toope: Okay. Talk soon, Gregor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robertson: Namaste, Steve.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Quebec government spent much of the past two weeks being visibly embarrassed by what has become known as “pastagate.” It began when an Italian restauranteur in Montreal complained that an inspector from the <span class="companylink">Office québécois de la langue française</span> had ordered him to remove Italian words, including pasta, from his menus. The embarrassment deepened when other restaurant owners revealed they had been ordered by inspectors to tape over the “on/off” button on a microwave, and not use English words on their shopping lists. The stories spread around the world, and Quebec briefly became an international laughingstock. So Diane De Courcy, the minister responsible for the Charter of the French Language, vowed to review the rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The results of certain inquiries have lent themselves, with reason, to very severe criticism,” Mme De Courcy told the press. “This is not desirable, not for the businesses, not for the office personnel, not for francophones or anglophones.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mme De Courcy thinks the criticism has been severe thus far, she should gird herself for what will come next. The Parti Québécois minority government is currently promoting Bill 14, a massive revision and expansion of every section of Quebec's Charter of the French Language, as well as of the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, which was tabled in December. Bill 14, if passed as introduced, will give dramatic new powers to language inspectors, to the government and to hardline language activists looking to make hay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take the dreaded language inspectors, for instance. Under the section of the Charter of the French Language governing the OQLF as it currently stands, inspectors can “request” documents from people or businesses suspected of language violations. Under the amendments proposed in Bill 14, inspectors will have the power to “require the production of any book, account, record, file or other document for examination or for the purpose of making copies or extracts,” and to “seize any thing which he or she believes on reasonable grounds may prove the commission of an offence.” Those are policing powers, not powers of inspection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As well, where currently someone alleged to have committed an infraction is given time to comply before charges are laid, Bill 14 removes the mention of a compliance period. Instead, once an infraction is suspected, the OQLF “shall refer the matter to the Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions so that appropriate penal proceedings may be instituted.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Bill 14's amendments are adopted, English schools in Quebec will be required to ensure students are proficient enough in French to “interact and flourish in Quebec society, and participate in its development.” The government will withhold the high-school or college diplomas of students who don't meet this self-serving standard. The government will also have a say about who can be accepted into an English-language college. And it will reach into daycares, requiring providers to “include activities aimed at helping children familiarize themselves gradually with the French language.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill 14 takes away the right of Canadian soldiers stationed in Quebec to educate their children in English. It requires businesses with more than 25 employees to work entirely in French, where the threshold is currently 50. It gives a person the right to file a complaint if they think they have been harassed at work for their inability to speak a language other than French. And it will end the bilingual status of dozens of municipalities that have historic English populations that date back to Confederation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As well, Bill 14 narrows the rights of the individual in the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, adding as a basic protection, in the same section that guarantees freedom of religion and freedom of thought, “the right to live and work in French in Quebec to the extent provided for in the Charter of the French Language.” Charters of rights and freedoms were invented to protect minorities; under Bill 14, Quebec's charter will ensure the rights of the province's majority. It's an extraordinary move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The French language is as much a part of Canada as English is, and Canadians generally accept that it needs protections in order to survive. Lately there seems to have been a balance that has settled on the province. There are few reasonable people who want Quebec's language laws to be either scaled back or made more restrictive, and support for another referendum sits at a low 30 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's something sinister then, when, at the same time the PQ government intones that the backlash over the relatively minor pastagate scandal was “not desirable,” it is selling a bill whose proposed amendments will unquestionably ignite a much greater backlash. The only logical way to understand such a contradictory move is that Bill 14 is part of a deliberate strategy of confrontation with Ottawa and English Canada designed to create the polarized conditions that would favour another referendum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that makes it all rather odious. It is one thing to want to start a legitimate argument about the future of Quebec. It is another entirely to use troubling, heavy-handed measures that include giving explicit powers of seizure to language inspectors and making the ability to live and work in French a charter right to get the ball rolling. The PQ is not so much picking a fight as it is revealing an ugly side of Quebec's hard-core separatist movement.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was something enthralling in the sight, on Thursday night, of young Egyptians, some clad in underwear, making rhythmic pelvic thrusts in front of the Cairo headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Harlem Shake is an unlikely medium of revolution, but the dance craze this week became the latest front in the showdown between Islamic politics and the drive toward individualism and independence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is winning? At first glance, things look pretty dark: Two years after anti-authoritarian revolutions ruptured the Middle East and North Africa, the forces of Islamic conservatism generally have the upper hand. Their restrictive views, especially around matters of women, sexuality and personal life, are beginning to manifest on the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beneath the surface, something more complex appears to be taking place – perhaps not a whole country embracing the libertine abandon of those dancers, but an Arab world that is making the break, however slowly and awkwardly, from the restrictions of traditional family life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In broad strokes,” the Egyptian-Canadian writer Shereen El Feki writes in Sex and the Citadel, her fascinating new survey of the intimate lives of women in the Arab world and especially in Cairo, “this sexual climate looks a lot like the West on the brink of the sexual revolution.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a fairly startling statement, especially given how atrocious life is for a majority of women in Egypt. This is a country where more than 90 per cent of married women have had genital-mutilating operations between the ages of 9 and 12, and where a third of them believe that these clitorectomies prevent sexual promiscuity (even though most prostitutes have undergone the procedure). It is a place where 60 per cent of highly educated women (and three-quarters of less-educated women) believe that women who dress “provocatively” are at fault if they are raped – and where domestic abuse and sex assaults are measured at levels many times higher than the worst places in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worse, there is a highly popular belief, across the Arab world and especially strong in Egypt, that women are fragile things in need of protection. As the Salafist TV-star imam Mahmoud al-Masry tells Ms. El Feki, “I believe that the woman is like a diamond, to be preserved. We do not suppress or oppress the woman – I want to protect her.” That, of course, is the ultimate form of denigration; it is accompanied by an equally widespread and often grotesque fetishization of virginity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With those ingredients, how could anyone be hopeful? For one thing, because none of it is timeless or inevitable: Much of the sexual conservatism, and extreme restriction of women's liberties (including the covering of heads) is a development of the colonial years and their aftermath, an angry generation's reaction to isolation and deprivation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But also because Arab family life is changing very fast – especially in two crucial ways. The first is female literacy, which has risen from less than a quarter in 1980 to about 65 per cent today. The second is family size: In 1960, the average Egyptian woman had almost seven children; today it is 2.7, and falling fast. This isn't as dramatic a change as in Iran, Turkey, Tunisia, Lebanon or the United Arab Emirates, which now have European-sized families, but it is a crucial indicator: Everywhere in the world (including the West), the moment when sexual and gender relations began to transform dramatically followed the moment when female literacy passed above 50 per cent and family sizes began to fall sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And wherever this change has occurred, it has been accompanied by social tension and often political turmoil. It is, in the words of the demographer Joseph Courbage, who has chronicled this dramatic “secularization of family life” in the Arab world, “not at all necessary to speculate about some particular essence of Islam in order to explain the violence now stirring the Muslim world. That world is disoriented because it is undergoing the shock of the revolution in modes of thought associated with increased literacy and widespread birth control.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is what Ms. El Feki has seen beneath the head scarves of Cairo: “struggles toward democracy and personal rights; the rapid growth of cities and a growing strain on family structures; loosening community controls on private behaviour; a huge population of young people whose influences and attitudes diverge from those of their parents.” It is, she says, a sexual revolution “in embryo” – visible, sometimes, only in a burst of Harlem Shake.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘It not the band I hate, it's their fans,” Chris Murphy of the Canadian rock band Sloan once sang. It's an amusing lyric and one that gets to the heart of a central pop-culture dilemma: Is it possible for an otherwise artistically credible artist or group to be tainted by uncool fans?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer, of course, is a resounding yes – whether we like it or not, fans affect our perception of the band. But it goes both ways because bands, in turn, also affect our perception of the fan. Trippy huh?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take David Cameron. For years now, the British Tory Prime Minister – a man who until recently believed that “lol” stands for “lots of love” and whose head, as the columnist Caitlin Moran hilariously observed, resembles “a slightly camp gammon robot, a C-3PO made of ham” – has maintained that he's a fan of the Smiths – a.k.a. the original Mancunian indie outfit beloved of outraged vegan undergrads everywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, Cameron chose the Smiths track This Charming Man, which opens with one of the most iconic Johnny Marr guitar riffs of all time, as one of his favourite songs on the BBC radio interview program Desert Island Discs. Since then Marr and, to a lesser extent, the band's former front man Morrissey have issued regular warnings to Cameron to stop liking their music. Marr, it goes without saying, is no fan of the Tories. His most recent warning, which came while Marr was promoting his first solo album, The Messenger (released Tuesday), on radio last month, was particularly testy. “I do forbid him to like it,” he said of the PM's fondness for This Charming Man. “He shouldn't like us because we're not his kind of people.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Cameron, who is said to have been a fan of the band since his boarding-school days at Eton College in the 1980s, has remained defiant in the face of Marr's fan fatwa. In the past, he has mentioned the Smiths during Question Time (poking fun at the Foreign Secretary William Hague with a reference to the song, William, It Was Really Nothing) and he stood firm when questioned on the matter during his recent trade mission in Delhi. “I'm afraid I will go on and listen to the Smiths,” he told the BBC with a strained smile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's all just a bit of fun, as the Brits would say. But it's hardly the first time it's happened. Late last year here in Canada, Torquil Campbell, lead singer of the band Stars, lashed out at Andrew MacDougall, Stephen Harper's director of communications, for daring to like his band's new album. “Leave our record alone,” he tweeted at MacDougall, whom he described as a thug employed by “a sociopath who is ruining the country.” Similarly, then Oasis lead singer Noel Gallagher once famously griped that he was “tired of taking flak” after then prime minister Tony Blair declared he was a fan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's perfectly understandable that rock stars get annoyed when mainstream politicians declare their love. (The opposite is true of U.S. President Barack Obama, but that's just because most American pop stars voted for him, or would have if pop stars vote, which I strongly suspect they mostly don't.) What could be more annoying than watching a mainstream power broker in a suit drop the name of your best counter-cultural single in order to temper his conservative image?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the blessing of the suit can affect the perception of the single. Much as we might delude ourselves to the contrary, pop cultural entities – whether we're talking about Warhol's soup can, Rihanna's body or the new Stars album – are, by their very nature, inextricably bound up with the following they inspire. The reasons we like or don't like them have as much to do with our hard-wiring as social animals as it does with their perceived quality or worth. We don't become fans in a vacuum, after all. We respond to certain things because they move us, but also because we aspire to be the sort of people who are moved by certain things. Culture, in other words, operates both as an objective force and as a reflection of our identity and taste. This is why, for instance, I was obsessed by Ryan Gosling after the dark, brooding indie flick Half Nelson, but a few years later when he ripped off his shirt in the romantic comedy Crazy Stupid Love, I felt nothing. It was no reflection on Gosling's talent or charisma (both of which were still objectively high), I was simply annoyed that the movie theatre was full of people with Sex and the City ring tones. That's the way fandom works: It's first in, first out. Authenticity is bound up with discovery, and once everyone knows about something, the secret bond between the early diehard fan and the cultural product is lost. (Let's just say I liked Gosling's early work.) Even worse for the artist is when a embarrassing fan is seen to be adopting them for the optics alone. Just think of former U.K. prime minister Gordon Brown, who declared he was a fan of the Arctic Monkeys, then famously failed to name a single song.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So can a band “unfan” a disreputable admirer the way one might “unfriend” someone on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>? Are artists allowed to ban people they don't admire from liking their work?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sadly for Johnny Marr and Torquil Campbell, the answer is no. In the meantime, we all get to sit back and wait for the next politician to jump on the pop-music bandwagon. Because one thing is certain: Bigmouth will strike again. He always does.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's RRSP time, again!</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Check the Web. Scour the newspapers. Hustle to your friendly (?) financial institution and plunk down your cash. That is, if you have any.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 25 per cent of Canadians have RRSPs. The reason more do not is simple: They don't have the money. Or, they don't think ahead, being young or insouciant, or both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RRSPs are an add-on, albeit an important one, to retirement income planning. So are Tax-Free Savings Accounts. So are other forms of personal savings. So, critically, are pension plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These, however, are under stress almost everywhere. What to do about pensions is therefore among the thorniest problems today – for governments and the private sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, the gold standard for pensions was the Defined Benefit (DB) plan. Pay in and get an assured, fixed pension, indexed to inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, just 9 per cent of people in the private sector have DB plans. Employers have been scrapping them as fast as possible, forcing employees into Defined Contribution (DC) plans in which they shoulder more of the investment risk. And, of course, there are many people whose companies have no plans, or people who are self-employed and don't earn enough for an RRSP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DBs survive in the public sector. But even there, many are struggling to be financially sound, although their continuation is defended vigorously by public-sector unions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the mighty <span class="companylink">Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan</span> is changing its ways. It has no choice. Automatic cost-of-living adjustments are out. More risk will be allowed in investments. Even with top-of-the-class investment results, the fund can't keep up with demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teachers are overwhelmingly women. They are living longer than ever. An increasing number of them receive pensions for longer than they worked. This obviously cannot continue without change: later retirements, more contributions, smaller pensions or some combination of changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Universities have massive pension liabilities, courtesy of low investment returns, too-small contributions and commitments that cannot be afforded. Bringing them to proper funding levels will require higher contributions from employees or some miraculous recovery in market returns, or both. The status quo, coupled with the requirement to put them on a sounder footing, will mean millions taken from operating budgets, the largest element of which are employees' salaries and benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some public institutions – the <span class="companylink">New Brunswick government</span> in the lead – have moved to shared-risk pensions, which lessen guarantees, raise contribution rates and retirement age for younger employees, and link anything above basic pensions to market performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's happened to pensions is the perfect storm of unforeseen events. Everyone knew the population was going to age, but not as fast as it has. Mortality rates have been improving more rapidly than almost anyone foresaw. Investment income, courtesy of the financial recession and slower economic growth, has deteriorated. Interest rates hit rock bottom and have remained there. For how long no one knows, but given the enduring weakness of Western economies, central banks are likely to keep them low for some time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What to do about federal retirement benefits has produced many debates but few decisions. The government did introduce Pooled Registered Pension Plans that look, walk and smell like group RRSPs, and are therefore likely to be of limited use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No consensus has emerged about the Canada Pension Plan, a joint federal-provincial responsibility. The Harper government thinks the economy is too fragile to take contribution hikes, and doesn't like anything that resembles higher taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labour argues that only mandatory contributions work; voluntary ones will cover only people with lots of spare cash, a minority of the population. Raise the contributions, labour says, and give lower-income people a better pension. Make more employers have private pension plans – to which small business screams about another cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CPP rates eventually are going to rise, either across the board or by having an additional compulsory contribution go into an individual's plan. Or, governments could acknowledge that seniors' needs for drugs are almost universal, and so add drugs for seniors to the CPP, paid for by higher contributions, an initiative that would meet a genuine social need and extend the spirit of medicare in a financially responsible fashion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Senator Mike Duffy claimed to have been thrown for a loop by the questions on the Senate expense forms. Senators are presented with two statements: “My primary residence is located within 100 kilometres from Parliament Hill” and “My primary residence is more than 100 kilometres from Parliament Hill.” They are required to check one of the two boxes. Mr. Duffy admitted to having checked the wrong one, at least twice.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He claimed “the forms are confusing” and, indeed, “arcane.” I wonder how he copes with that customs-declaration stumper, “I/we have visited a farm and will be going to a farm in Canada in the next 14 days.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Duffy has been evasive about questions around his claims of a housing allowance (offered to senators who must be in Ottawa for Senate business but also are required to live in their home provinces) totalling at least $42,802 over two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, Mr. Duffy lives and votes in Kanata, a suburb of Ottawa, in a home he purchased five years before he was appointed to the Senate in 2008. He has a modest, seasonal cottage in Cavendish, PEI, which is reportedly seldom used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs there may be a number of these houses across the country – dark, lifeless, spooky places children rush by after sundown because some people say those houses have senators. Conservative Senator Pamela Wallin, now-independent Senator Patrick Brazeau and Liberal Senator Mac Harb are also being investigated for questionable secondary-residence expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Duffy, when faced with this audit of his expenses and asked for proof of his PEI residency – specifically, a health card – frantically applied for one (he currently holds an Ontario health card), asking that his application be expedited to meet the audit deadline. Last week, after two months of statements (including an attack on the professionalism of the journalist who broke the story) that were so all over the map no province would give them a health card, Mr. Duffy said he would pay back the money, but admitted no wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Canadians know Mike Duffy. They've known me for years and they know that I would never do anything that was inappropriate and I would never, ever take advantage of my position,” he said, making an enormous assumption about Canada's level of Duffy awareness and delight, and a strong case for the abolition of senators talking about themselves in the third person.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Duffy issued a statement in which he said that he would be returning the accommodation money because the issue had become “a distraction,” making himself the latest in a long line of public figures to embrace the word “distraction.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bemoaning the fact that an accusation against you has become a distraction is a fashionable way of saying, “The problem is less that I did a bad thing than that you insist on talking about the bad thing I did. And that may stand in the way of me doing other things – possibly good things, but let's be realistic, possibly equally distracting things – that I'd really like to get up to.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People often announce their status as a distraction before they resign. It's a bit like saying, “Think of me not as someone who broke the rules, but as a tied soccer game going on outside your Grade 7 classroom window on a warm spring day.” Or, “I'm but the taut, pink bra strap of the girl in front of you when you have an exam coming up, so I'll make my benign-but-ill-situated self scarce, for the good of all.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Duffy, however, shows no sign of resigning. PEI residency rules don't apply to the Senate, he noted, seemingly happy to demonstrate literacy in any set of rules that absolve him – just not the rules that govern the Senate, which don't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marjory LeBreton, government leader in the Senate, said this that week the mere signing of a declaration of qualification form claiming to be from the Island qualifies one for the Senate. Apparently there's an “if I clap my hands, I am actually Tinkerbell” clause in there somewhere, officially making being a senator the best job in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I am entitled to be a senator from PEI,” Mr. Duffy said – not because he lives there, but because, as he said: “My heart is in PEI.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By this logic, I should at least be part-time mayor of New York. But hearts aren't mentioned in the Constitution, any more than the i's in that unsentimental document are dotted with them.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last weekend, the Oscars. This weekend, the Canadian Screen Awards (Sunday, CBC, 8 p.m.). The hullabaloo never stops. The drama is ceaseless. Soon, those who suffer from nervous excitement will demand a pause in the ceaseless stimulus.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that's not all. This weekend also sees the arrival of two huge (huge, huge, I tell you!) sprawling dramas that take us back to time immemorial, when men were men, and women were … well, you'll have to see it for yourself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, though, comes the anti-Doyle, anti-Newfoundland, and as they might say in Newfoundland, “crooked” (only joking, of course) Canadian Screen Awards. The old Gemini Awards and the old Genie Awards rolled into one night of prize-giving, at which will be honoured the great and the good and some TV shows that have fewer viewers than this column has readers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The host is Martin Short, and it will be interesting to witness his knowledge of Canadian TV gained from the vantage point of a home in Pacific Palisades, Calif. Does he know that the anchor of CBC's The National is always called Pastor Mansbridge? Does he know about Claire Martin and the history of the unnerving way she interacts with the Pastor?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyway, big awards for our best movies and TV shows and the performances therein are handed out. There is a passel of talent to present the awards, including Jay Baruchel and Kim Coates (both of Goon), Enrico Colantoni (Flashpoint), James Cromwell (Still), Arlene Dickinson (Dragons' Den), Erica Durance (Saving Hope), Catherine O'Hara (Frankenweenie), Brad (Brad) Smith (The Bachelor Canada), Meg Tilly (Bomb Girls), and Allan Hawco (Republic of Doyle).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is exceptionally obliging of Hawco to participate because the really interesting aspect of the first Canadian Screen Awards is that Republic of Doyle, the series he created and stars in, was pretty much shut out of the nominations. It seems that a single nomination, for Gordon Pinsent in a guest role, is the sum total of the show's achievements. Not a word of a lie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hence the perception that this whole thing is anti-Doyle, anti-Newfoundland, and as they might say in in those parts, “crooked” (only joking, of course).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One imagines that Hawco will spend the evening going around to everyone he meets and telling them that he has this show, called Republic of Doyle, it's on Sundays on CBC, and darn popular. Even internationally renowned, actually. So internationally renowned that Academy Award-winner Russell Crowe has done a guest spot. Perhaps he'll be handing out DVDs of the show. Perhaps some of the nobs from the Canadian TV racket will reply that they thank him for this new information and it's a great pity the information was not more widely disseminated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listen, people of the Canadian film and TV rackets: The bizarre anomaly of shows being shut out of the awards was supposed to end. Now, enjoy the Canadian Screen Awards, savour the parties and shindigs. But get it together for next year on the Doyle front, or else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also airing this weekend</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bible (Sunday, History Television, 8 p.m.) will be a puzzler for those who have read the book on which it is based. On the evidence of the confusing excerpts sent for review, it seems to be mainly the re-enactment of battles: a sword-and-sandals epic with low-grade special effects and a great many actors talking in British accents through clenched teeth. People named Abraham and Moses walk around looking perplexed by everything, as if they'd wandered in from a Game of Thrones knockoff and were wondering when the sexy stuff was supposed to start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main force behind the series is reality-TV maestro Mark Burnett and his wife, Touched by an Angel star Roma Downey (who turns up eventually as the Virgin Mary), and their mission is to deliver major scenes from the Bible, one after the other, until you're perplexed by the speed of it all.

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commentators have been weighing in about why Oscar host Seth MacFarlane's song We Saw Your Boobs, which poked fun at actresses who've done nude scenes, offended them, and I'd like to add my thoughts. The bit might have worked in a different venue, a comedy club or frat house. But in a ceremony that honours artistic excellence, it was wrong in every way. Many have noted that the name-checked actresses – among them, Naomi Watts, Meryl Streep and Kate Winslet – are high calibre, and the films in which they did nudity are serious, and that's true. A-list actresses don't doff their clothes on camera unless they believe it serves the story, which means that the scenes MacFarlane sang about were likely significant ones, trying to express something meaningful about beauty, sexuality or vulnerability. No one does these scenes carelessly; everyone's worst fear is that they will catapult the viewer out of a film and into the realm of peeping Toms. This makes MacFarlane's mockery not only puerile but demeaning. Would it be funny to mock, say, the models for Botticelli?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To take this one step further, I believe that even if MacFarlane had sung about D-list actresses in moronic comedies, the number still would have been offensive. Not just because chortling about “boobs” reduces all women to mere vehicles for their sexual organs; that's obvious. (And personally, I think the only appropriate use of the word “boob” is to mean “buffoon.”) But also because it's insanely hard for actresses to find film work, period. Too often, stupid movies that exploit them are the only roles available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's been true for decades, and it's still true – three-fourths of the speaking parts in movies and television go to men. To pigeonhole any actress for doing her job perpetuates the idea that titillation is all women are “good for,” which in turn perpetuates the scarcity of other kinds of roles. Honestly, watching half of humankind suffer from incessant marginalization and denigration is dispiriting and exhausting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the new thriller Stoker, which opened yesterday, Mia Wasikowska pulls off precisely the kind of nuanced, emotionally significant nude scene that I'm talking about. To explain further would spoil it, so I'll say only that it takes place in a shower – and that in a phone interview this week, director Chan-wook Park said (via interpreter) it was this scene that convinced him to make Stoker his first English-language film. (One of South Korea's masters of the genre, he's best known in North America for the films Thirst and Oldboy.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wasikowska plays India Stoker, an unsettling girl whose adored father dies on her 18th birthday, leaving her alone with her needy mother, Evelyn (Nicole Kidman), and her Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode), whom she's never met before, but who seems to understand her better than anyone else. “He is the external influence that stimulates the evil in her to bloom,” Park says – the “stoker” of it. Park skillfully grounds the resulting horror in reality (liberally spiced with literary and Freudian references), and unwinds it at a stately pace, the better to engage viewers' minds while fraying our nerves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Park believes in evil, he says: “It is very much a part of human beings. It is a human weakness, inside each and every one of us.” Teenagers are the ideal subjects to express this, he continued, because “they are in an emotionally confused state, prone to seduction by evil.” And teenage girls, he added, are the most ideal subjects for horror films – think The Ring, The Exorcist, The Bad Seed – because we expect them to be vulnerable and sweet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Young women react very sensitively to the world that surrounds them, be it evil or beauty,” Park says, “and once they are attracted to a notion, they get deeply engrossed and affected. So using a young woman to convey the idea of evil is shocking and frightening.” Park courted Wasikowska because, “she already has a sense of mysteriousness about her.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think we all have good and bad angels inside us, our wants and jealousies,” Goode agreed in a separate phone interview. “You're only three bad mistakes away from going to jail, that's how I think about life. This is a story of India's coming of age and her sexual empowerment, and as we know, sex and violence are [psychically] closely linked. To see someone who seems virginal, and therefore passive, become violent, that's disturbing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To maintain the aura of dread, Park asked his actors to be perpetually in a state of unease. “Any moments that were contrary to this notion were cut out during the editing phase,” he says. “The audience needs to see that their facial expressions may say one thing, but what goes on underneath is always different.” He also asked them to express their emotions – even the biggest, most shocking swings – “not in any big way, but only through subtle performance,” he says. “To only use small expressions, so the audience feels compelled to pay closer attention, in order not to miss any of them.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Director Park is incredibly fastidious,” Goode says. “I've never seen anyone storyboard something to the nth degree as he does. Almost in a worrying way, because we were delivered a folder with every frame of the film exactly how he was going to shoot it. You think, ‘Does that give me much room to discover and explore?' But any idea you had, if he liked, it he would try and implement it. That's a real joy. He's a master with the camera, and there's so much symbolism and thought gone into every single moment that you start to think all the other films you've been on were lazy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, Park and his cast shot everything, including the shower scene, with genuine artistic intention. Boobs need not apply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘I FRACTURED THE OCCASIONAL LAW'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matthew Goode, 34, is so fiendishly charming that his playing a handsome Devil in Stoker is practically typecasting. He's one of a coterie of up-and-coming Brits that includes Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch (now on HBO in Parade's End), Ben Whishaw (Bond's newest Q) and Laurence Fox (son of actor James Fox), friends who are often up for the same role. “There have been times we've almost literally been in the pub together waiting to see who's getting the job,” Goode says. “You end up feeling like you've grown up together.” He laughs. “It's hardly difficult to envision, actors meeting in a bar and getting on. I'm not saying we're Harris and Burton, but we've had our moments.” In fact, Goode ended up in Stoker only after his friend Colin Firth dropped out because “his schedule became too mental,” Goode says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Born in Devon, schooled at Exeter and London's Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art, and possessed of the poshest accent in England's green and pleasant land, Goode excels at playing louche lovelies (an aristocrat in Brideshead Revisited, Firth's lover in A Single Man). “I used to be more mischievous,” he says merrily. “I fractured the occasional law. Now that I'm a dad, I don't have time.” (His daughter with long-time partner Sophie Dymoke, Matilda Eve, just turned 4.) “I suffer from general exhaustion, so I'm pretty well behaved. Really, I'm a wonderfully conservative Englishman; I won't even go to a naked beach, let alone stab someone.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His family accompanied him to Nashville, where Stoker was filmed. Nicole Kidman, who lives there, showed them around, and they went two-stepping at honky-tonks with Mia Wasikowska. “I'm quite hard on myself as an actor,” Goode says. “Some days I think I didn't get where I needed to be. It's easier if you have your family around you, because when you come home, you can recover: ‘I'll put Moo to bed.' That's why I like working in England. I like to hang up my suit at the end of the day and be dad and hubby.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His next project, the pilot for a TV series called The Vatican, will take him to Rome. Will he play the Pope? “I'm the papal secretary, darling,” he says. “Kyle Chandler is playing a cardinal, and Sebastian Koch, an amazing actor from The Lives of Others, is one of the leads. Ridley Scott is directing the pilot, so it bodes well.” I suspect Goode's days of waiting in pubs are over.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City hall likes its unelected officials bland and obedient. Most of them are happy to play the part, keeping their heads down and letting city councillors grab the headlines. Not Jennifer Keesmaat. The city's new chief planner is on her way to becoming modern Toronto's first celebrity bureaucrat, and some people don't like it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Keesmaat, 42, seems to be everywhere these days – giving speeches, tweeting up a storm, leading public consultations and heading up high-end talks. York University's magazine put her on the cover, asking: “Can urban planner Jennifer Keesmaat help Toronto make a comeback?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leaving a flourishing career as an urban-design consultant in September, she arrived at city hall like a gust of fresh air. With her bright-eyed passion for cities and her open, engaging personality, she has already emerged as a leading advocate for change in a city that sometimes seems stuck up to its axles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Feeling Congested? consultation, she challenges Torontonians to join a conversation about gridlock and consider what they are willing to pay for fixing it. In the Chief Planner Roundtable, she is bringing in leading thinkers to brainstorm about issues like how to transform the sprawling suburbs. Her first session this week drew an overflow crowd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As I lie awake nights thinking of the gargantuan challenges we have – because they are, and they're completely overwhelming – what's become clear to me is that I've got to bring as many people into the conversation as possible,” she says. “It's not good enough for me to sit at my desk and be really clever – if I am really clever [she adds with a laugh].”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her high profile has raised eyebrows at city hall. Some city councillors complain privately that she is getting ahead of herself and freelancing city policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think they would be more comfortable if she would concede that the final arbiter of the public good is council,” says Councillor Adam Vaughan, who stresses that he himself applauds her for speaking up about how critical good planning is to the city's future. “If she deliberately excludes politicians from the process, she will find herself alone on the floor of council and alone in the city. The people make decisions, not bureaucrats.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Keesmaat has not helped her own cause. At a council meeting in November, she issued a cheeky tweet suggesting that councillors' speeches were becoming “insufferable” because, with Mayor Rob Ford then facing ouster over conflict-of-interest allegations, “half of council is considering running for mayor.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She says she deleted the item within minutes after a city councillor complained. “I'm learning the hard way,” she said during a public “fireside chat” with Mississauga Mayor Hazel McCallion this week. “I'm almost petrified before I say anything because I'm so hyper-conscious of the way my words can be misconstrued.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not too petrified, though. She told a board of trade event in January that “we have a political culture that is very challenging.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But given all the good she is doing, it would be a mistake to slap her down over a few indiscreet remarks. The city desperately needs leadership and, at the moment, there is precious little coming from the political side. If it takes a celebrity civil servant, so be it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deputy city manager John Livey praises her for “really raising the profile of planning and the import of a thoughtful discussion of urban issues.” Former chief planner Paul Bedford says that, unlike a federal or provincial deputy minister, a planner should feel free to speak out. “I think that's the role of the chief planner – to say what they think of the issues facing the city.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Keesmaat herself has no intention of fading into the wallpaper. “As radical as it may seem here,” she says, the trend is for major-city planners to be a “big voice” on urban issues. She points to New York's dynamic Amanda Burden – no “shrinking violet” by any means.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I did not come in here saying I was going to be traditional,” Ms. Keesmaat says. “I was pretty clear from the outset: I am not a bureaucrat. I am a kind of a can-do, change-agent type of person. I've been entrepreneurial my whole career and that is the approach I've taken to this role – focusing on how can we be creative and what are the risks we need to take to get there.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's hope she keeps at it. The last thing Toronto needs is for Jen Keesmaat to shut up.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Gibbons didn't have to ask anybody about Brett Lawrie's reputation. He'd heard about it second-hand and seen it when it made the news in 2012 – such as when his tossed helmet bounced and hit home plate umpire Bill Miller during a disputed strike call. Everybody, it seemed, had something to say about Lawrie and soon after Gibbons was appointed manager one Toronto newspaper forecast that the manager and his hot-headed third baseman were destined to clash.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was though the ghosts of Shea Hillebrand and Ted Lilly had come back dressed up as a tattooed, barrel-chested, Popeye-armed third baseman. “Everybody told me about him,” Gibbons said Friday, after Lawrie slugged his first home run of the spring in a 5-4 win over the <span class="companylink">Tampa Bay Rays</span> at Florida Auto Exchange Stadium. “Thing is, I think he's right where he needs to be this spring. In fact it's funny; I think he's slowed down a little bit. At least he seems more relaxed than what I expected.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrie has so far avoided falling into some of the traps of 2012. Whether it's the proximity of 15-year veteran Mark De Rosa, whose spring training locker was deliberately put next to Lawrie's as is also expected to be the case at the Rogers Centre, or the approach of the World Baseball Classic, the Langley, B.C., native seems to have fit in to a clubhouse whose transformation has only seemed to reinforce the callowness of his game and development as a professional – yet doing so in a manner that offers not cause for concern, but rather cause for hope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of his closest friends on the team, J.P. Arencibia, has maintained there is a depth of baseball moxie to Lawrie that is not always recognized. He was not surprised during an early round of live batting practice against knuckleballer R.A. Dickey to see Lawrie moving up and then back in the batter's box, eventually becoming the first person in camp to make solid contact against Dickey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“R.A. was the first guy I saw live in spring training,” Lawrie said, chuckling. “I just wanted to see what happened if I moved up a bit against him. I was comfortable, I thought, hitting against Tim Wakefield, because he usually threw a knuckleball just one speed. R.A. has that fastball he'll zip in on you. He's got some other stuff besides just one speed.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unravelling of Lawrie's 2012 season pretty much mirrored that of the <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span>, whether it was helmet-tossing, getting caught making bad base-running decisions on balls in front of him – famously making an out at third base in a game against the <span class="companylink">Boston Red Sox</span> that for many people summed up the sloppiness of the team, and was an incident that many read as spurring Omar Vizquel to make his comments critical of a clubhouse culture that was short on accountability – or putting himself in the type of harm's way that militates against a long career.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrie became a big deal almost by default last season, in large measure because other than slugger Jose Bautista there really wasn't much in the way of star power. In the fantastical minds of some followers, Lawrie was going to be a Canadian-born version of Bryce Harper. Not quite – although De Rosa, who was a teammate of Harper's with the <span class="companylink">Washington Nationals</span>, isn't quite so dismissive of the comparison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They have very similar personalities,” De Rosa said. “Bryce is a little more laidback than Brett is, but their passion for the game – their passion for wanting to be the best there is, for playing the game hard and wanting to play it the right way – is very similar.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">De Rosa laughed when he was asked what he thought of his new teammate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think he's an animal,” De Rosa said. “When we're out there taking infield together, it's like he has enough energy for the both of us. From what I've seen, there's nothing he can't do on the field. His talent is off the charts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But, there are times when you have to pull in the reins a bit. Hopefully, I can become a sounding board for him when he needs to talk. Maybe pass some nuggets along the way that can help him break out. He does everything you can do on the field. I guess what I'd like to do is expedite things.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gibbons has inherited a lineup full of speed – Jose Reyes, Emilio Bonifacio and Maicer Izturis – that will feature four switch-hitters. The top four is set and Lawrie could find himself hitting anywhere from fifth to seventh. But wherever he bats, Lawrie has already brought into the message that in 2013 it is about making the playoffs and winning a championship; if he needs added motivation, he can find it through the knowledge that nobody is yet talking about giving him the kind of multiyear, arbitration-covering contract that organizations give young, cornerstone players.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year was about hard-selling Lawrie to fans; this year it's apparent it will be a soft sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrie has heard loud and clear Gibbons's message that errors in the field cost pitches and errors on the basepaths cost runs. He is aware of what happened this winter, and what the overhaul means to him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You look at all the talent and the experience on this team, and really all we have to do is just do what each of us are capable of doing,” Lawrie said. “No one needs to do above and beyond what they can do. If we try to do things outside our comfort zone, and try to force the issue? That's when things can go south.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody, it seems, need tell this to Lawrie, and that is a good sign. Do not bet against Lawrie giving people something else to talk about in 2013.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week brought the relaunch of two historical curiosities: one, a leather-upholstered, disaster-prone relic from another time, and the other the Titanic. It is a particularly human trait to ignore the lessons of the past, and so we found ourselves welcoming back a ship that sank on its maiden voyage, and Silvio Berlusconi, a man who has sunk more than his share of maidens.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First to New York, where an Australian mining tycoon – a little-known law requires that rich miners always be called tycoons – announced that his heart's desire, Titanic II, would be built in a Chinese shipyard to the exact specifications of its doomed namesake. Except with a sturdier hull and more lifeboats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Otherwise, said our starry-eyed tycoon, Clive Palmer, all will be as it was when the Titanic sailed from Southampton a century ago, never to return. The new ship will be outfitted exactly like the original, down to the quaint exercise equipment, the three classes and the menus, although you have to wonder whether the 2,435 passengers may be too nervous to choke down more than a bite of roast squab and cress or salmon mousseline. Mr. Palmer said his company had already received 40,000 “expressions of interest” for Titanic II's maiden voyage, planned for 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Presumably, these are not people who worry that this is an exercise in tempting fate, sticking out a tongue at the gods or putting the “fool” in foolhardy. For Mr. Palmer, who will encourage passengers to wear period dress, the new ship represents a nostalgic dream: “Titanic comes from a time when the world was different. When there was a different culture, different ways of living, when people worked with each other more.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And women couldn't vote, and there was no penicillin … wait, sorry, where were we? Memories of a lost and better world, that's right. Let's turn the nostalgia goggles on Italy, where, against all rational notions of human progress and laws of mathematics, three-time premier and frequent occupier of the defendant's stand Silvio Berlusconi has returned to a central place in Italian politics. While his party did not actually win a majority in either the lower or upper houses of Parliament in this week's election, his right-wing faction came within a hair's breadth of success, winning about 30 per cent of the vote in the two houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That Berlusconi? I hear you saying. The one whose car was literally chased out of his official residence by angry Italians when he finally was shamed into resigning 15 months ago? The one who praised Mussolini this year on World Holocaust Day? The one who publicly taunted a woman about her sex life just days before the recent vote? The one who's in the midst of a sex and corruption trial and appealing his other conviction on tax fraud? The one who frequently changes the country's laws to protect himself from prosecution?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, that Berlusconi. If he were a boyfriend, your mother would take you aside and whisper “stalker” in your ear and the police would put posters of him around the neighbourhood and you'd buy new locks for your door – and possibly some garlic. He is Italy's stalker, unwilling to let it go and be its own country, free and independent of his wizened clutches. But, like an abused partner, unsure of its own worth, the country keeps returning to the hoary promises he's made again and again: I'll cut taxes. I'll fill your pockets. I'll keep nasty Europe off your back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're not even allowed to call him “clown” anymore, because professional clowns object to the comparison. And clowns tend to squeeze friends called Bozo into their minicars, not drive a nation's economy off a cliff. Dire figures came out of Italy on Friday: Unemployment is at 11.7 per cent, the highest rate in 21 years. Youth unemployment is nearly 40 per cent. That's hard to laugh at.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Berlusconi miracle,” read the headline the day after the elections in Il Giornale – which was probably written by Berlusconi's brother, who owns the newspaper. The family owns the main TV networks, too. For some voters, that headline must reflect reality: He's a known quantity. He represents nostalgia for a simpler time, before the world's economy hit an iceberg. When it was the captain's prerogative to cop a feel here or there, and no one screamed, “Basta!” Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to let the old goat have the wheel again?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surely there are better alternatives afloat. Mr. Berlusconi started as a cruise-ship singer, didn't he? And Mr. Palmer must need entertainers on Titanic II whose repertoire extends beyond Nearer My God to Thee. Just picture it: One historical relic aboard another, sailing into the sunset, never to be seen again.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GARMISCH-PARTENKIRCHEN, GERMANY -- Anna Fenninger of Austria upstaged the favourites to win a super G race Sunday, while overall World Cup winner Tina Maze was placed under police protection after organizers received a death threat against the Slovenian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maze finished fourth in the race and said she was not disturbed by the e-mailed threat. But she had two bodyguards close by after the race.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The death threat came in an e-mail received Saturday afternoon, after Maze had won the downhill race and broken the points record for a season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That's sad,” Maze said. “If somebody is strong and showing good performances and perfect in the thing you are doing, there are people who want to disturb you. I guess it's part of the game, but it didn't disturb me that much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It shouldn't be part of the game, but life is not perfect. It's not nice for me, it's not nice for my team. I haven't seen the e-mail … they want to ruin your day, ruin the record, but I enjoyed the day 100 per cent,” Maze said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Fischer, chief of the organizing committee, said the e-mail came from an anonymous source and that it was immediately turned over to the police.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We had to take it seriously, our job is to keep everyone safe here,” Fischer said. “Police took over the case and provided protection.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maze said she had never felt safer in her life: “I've had police in front my door all the time since yesterday.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fenninger beat hometown favourite Maria Hoefl-Riesch by 0.20 of a second on the Kandahar course for her third career victory and second of the season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Austrian also saw off Julia Mancuso of the United States in third and Maze in fourth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marie-Michèle Gagnon of Lac-Etchemin, Que., was 29th, struggling with a late start number on a deteriorating course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We knew it was going to be really difficult,” said Canadian women's coach Hugues Ansermoz. “About 15 girls went out near the end. It was getting dark on the pitch but [Gagnon] attacked so much. She took a chance and made a mistake coming into the darker part, but it's tough to be mad because she was attacking today. It was great to see.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mancuso and Maze are still in competition for the season super-G title, which will now be decided at the World Cup final in Lenzerheide, Switzerland, in two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maze is already assured of the overall title and became the first skier to collect more than 2,000 points in a season by winning Saturday's downhill on the same slope. She now has 2,074 points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mancuso said she lost the race in the middle section of the course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was not good in the turning section, I don't know what it is, maybe a question of confidence,” said the American, who was second in Friday's super G on the same slope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I am happy to be on the podium, just trying my best every day. I am enjoying it with the sun out. I wish I could have gained some more points on her [Maze], I need all the luck on my side. I need to win the [last] race and then anything can happen,” Mancuso said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maze leads Mancuso 420-365 in the super-G standings with a maximum of 100 points up for grabs in the final race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Mancuso, Maze also said she had problems with the jump in the middle section. “It was pretty difficult to find the right line, I didn't do my best but fourth is fine,” Maze said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maze won the gold medal in the super G at the world championships last month in Schladming, Austria, while Mancuso took bronze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fenninger covered the 2.37-kilometre Kandahar course in 1 minute 20.43 seconds. Hoefl-Riesch, who was hoping for her 25th World Cup win, missed it by 0.20, while Mancuso was 0.23 off the pace. Maze was 0.43 back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I deserved it, I was ready for this win and I believed in myself,” Fenninger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fenninger's previous two wins were in giant slalom.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two indicted war criminals are among the leading contenders for president and vice-president as Kenya's voters go to the polls Monday. Their leading competitor currently serves as Prime Minister in a coalition government widely regarded as corrupt.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The choices before 20 million Kenyan voters are therefore hardly what they might be in a pivotal African country. But that the electoral possibilities are so limited testifies to a major problem in much of today's Africa: a terrible shortage of responsible, committed, honest leadership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because so many sub-Saharan African countries are preinstitutional, and not yet fully nations, leaders matter immensely more than in the developed world. Leaders call the shots, as they have in most sub-Saharan African countries since independence in the 1960s. They set the ethical tone. If they are greedy, their citizens become more cynical and quality of governmental discourse suffers enormously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Africa and elsewhere, governments are expected by their subjects to provide security and safety, rule of law, open political participation, sustainable economic prospects and a large measure of human development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In states where political institutions are weak, legislatures are subordinate to executives, the media are barely free and the judiciary is subordinate rather than independent, the manner in which leaders behave as presidents and prime ministers is much more decisive than it might be in a fully-formed nation where political institutions constrain overweening executives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A majority of the countries of sub-Saharan Africa are still controlled by men who are motivated not by what they can do for their people but by what their people can do for them. Such leaders exist to prey on their own citizens, to extract from the body politic corrupt rents and other privileges that benefit the ruler and ruling class, their families, and their cliques or lineages. Presidents such as Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo in Equatorial Guinea and Isaias Afewerki in Eritrea are tyrants, but even some of the more moderate of Africa's leaders, like Yoweri Museveni in Uganda, exercise power primarily for themselves and their close ethnic associates, not for the entire nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately, middle-class voters in Kenya and other African states can look to Botswana and Mauritius for consistent good, responsible leadership examples. They can remember how Nelson Mandela led the first free South African government after 1994 and acted inclusively. They can also examine how effectively former president John A. Kufuor transformed Ghana in the earlier years of this century, after a series of corrupt and arbitrary presidents had driven the country to ruin, and how Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in war-torn Liberia and Joyce Banda in impoverished Malawi are attempting to improve the lives of all citizens – not just a favoured ethnic group or class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Botswana is the least corrupt country in Africa, according to <span class="companylink">Transparency International</span>, largely because Seretse Khama, its first president, eschewed corruption himself and rigorously refused to allow his cabinet ministers or officials to indulge. Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, the first prime minister of Mauritius, did the same. Now President Paul Kagame, Rwanda's strong president, is attempting to “cut off the head of the snake” by refusing to condone corrupt practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other African states, such as Kenya, are less fortunate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Political leadership is in a parlous state in large parts of sub-Saharan Africa. The military coup in supposedly democratic Mali a year ago made that point dramatically, especially as it led to an Islamist occupation of northern Mali and French intervention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately, the essentials of good leadership can be taught. What is needed, as the African Leadership Council advocated as long ago as 2004, is a comprehensive training program over many years to help build good leadership capacity among young African politicians. These apprentice politicians must be redirected in their aspirations and their methods before they begin to follow the oppressive and extractive model of some of their elders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs</span> and International Development and CIDA are well placed and sufficiently well-respected in Africa and internationally to sponsor such capacity-building interventions. The rewards would come slowly, but rather than devoting relatively modest sums to various otherwise worthy projects in various target countries, such as Mali, a comprehensive attempt to address Africa's biggest and most significant challenge – political leadership – would provide positive returns over time. To train the next generation of Africa's leaders would have a truly powerful payoff.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Have we already forgotten the tainted-blood tragedy – a debacle that left more than 20,000 Canadians infected with HIV and hepatitis C, and that has cost taxpayers more than $5-billion in compensation?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the many things that contributed to that public-health disaster was the use of blood from for-profit blood brokers – who purchased the products in places such as Haiti, skid row in Los Angeles, Arkansas prisons and Russian funeral homes, at the outset of the AIDS pandemic, no less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the overriding reason that Canada suffered the most damage per capita worldwide from tainted blood was a shocking lack of transparency and oversight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now we're getting another heaping tablespoon's worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That a company can hang up a shingle – beside a homeless shelter, no less – and start collecting and selling blood without prior public consultation and without informing Canadian Blood Services or provincial health authorities is evidence of a glaring legal loophole and a public-policy failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(The new company, Canadian Plasma Resources, owned by Exapharma Inc., does need to be licensed by <span class="companylink">Health Canada</span> but that is strictly a technical issue about the quality of equipment and procedures.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is one lesson we can take from our inglorious history in blood collection and distribution it is that lax regulation and bureaucratic blandishments kill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we're going to do this – allow paid blood donations on a large scale – then let's hash it publicly first, let's debate the pros and cons instead of shrugging our shoulders and assuming it doesn't matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will paid blood donations undermine the volunteer donation system? Despite all the testing, is paid blood as safe as volunteer blood? At the very minimum, those questions have to be answered before for-profit clinics are licensed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, the Canadian blood system is run by two independent agencies, Canadian Blood Services and Héma-Québec, and they collect, respectively, 850,000 and 160,000 units of blood a year, all of it from volunteer donors. (The Canadian Red Cross blood-services division carried out this role for decades but it was bankrupted, morally and financially, by the tainted-blood tragedy.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CBS said it has no plans to buy plasma from the new for-profit company and, under Quebec law, it is illegal to pay for blood. So, if there is no domestic market, why would Canadian Plasma Resources set up shop in Canada?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company did not return phone calls, but the only sensible answer to that question is because it plans to export plasma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are three principal components in blood: red cells, plasma and platelets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plasma, a thick straw-coloured part of blood, is essentially liquid gold. It can be broken down into a variety a specialized drugs such as clotting products for hemophiliacs, albumin used to treat burn victims, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IvIG), used to treat a variety of immune deficiencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But IvIG, a drug that costs a small fortune, is also showing promise in the treatment of Alzheimer's, meaning demand is set to soar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the reason that entrepreneurs want to buy plasma from homeless Canadians and students at $20 a pop. And, while you can donate blood only every 56 days, you can donate plasma weekly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we need to understand to have a reasoned debate, however, is how the market for plasma is changing. In Canada, most donors give whole blood, and plasma is extracted. In addition, there are about 6,000 plasma-only donors, most of whom give weekly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The demand for plasma has actually fallen considerably in recent years, largely because hemophiliacs now use recombinant (synthetic) clotting products. At the same time, the demand for components of plasma such as IvIG is way up. To manufacture IvIG you need to pool parts of plasma from thousands (and sometimes tens of thousands) of donors. Canada does not have the supply or the manufacturing capability to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, CBS and Héma-Québec buy these products in the United States and Europe, and they are made, in part, from paid blood donations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also a small company in Winnipeg, <span class="companylink">Cangene BioPharma Inc</span>., that has paid plasma donors for decades. However, most of its donors have a rare peculiarity, Rh-negative blood, and they produce antibodies used to create a lifesaving Rh immune globulin medication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this to say that we don't need a blanket ban on paid blood (or plasma) in Canada. But we should restrict payments to “rare circumstances,” to quote Justice Horace Krever, who headed the tainted-blood inquiry. What we do need is a blood system where decisions are made openly and rationally, one in which public safety always trumps commercial activity, lest we wish to repeat ignoble history.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We increasingly live in a world of predictions. Each day, we are confronted with an endless number of economic forecasts, statistical studies and consultants' reports telling us what the future will look like. Businesses and governments rush to adjust their policies accordingly.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, the fact that most of these predictions fail to come true does not seem to shatter our trust in forecasting. We devour the next report with the credulity of five-year-olds. We're told that the growing ability to collect and analyze huge amounts of data makes each forecast better than the last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What if the opposite is true? What if the 2.5 quintillion bytes of data that <span class="companylink">IBM</span> estimates are generated in the world each day – a number that's doubling every few years – are actually undermining the accuracy of forecasting and the effectiveness of policies that rely on it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the paradox of Big Data, the trendy term used to describe the massive datasets created in the Internet age. The sheer volume of new information at our fingertips surpasses our ability to understand it. Ever more powerful computers can store and measure all this data, but they cannot tell us what it all means. So far, only human beings can appreciate context, and we're not always very good at it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This in mind, Big Data should inspire humility. Instead, it seems to fuel hype and chutzpah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">McKinsey &amp; Company</span> predicts “a tremendous wave of innovation, productivity and growth – all driven by Big Data.” A recent Harvard Business Review article warns that “data-driven decisions tend to be better decisions. Leaders will either embrace this fact or be replaced by others who do.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Algorithms that rely on structured data (such as previous online purchases) and unstructured data (<span class="companylink">Facebook</span> posts) are now used to predict what people will buy, whom they will marry and which candidate they will vote for. But while very good at picking off the low-hanging fruit – such as the undergrad who “likes” Barack Obama – mathematical models have their limits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Great Recession should have made that clear. The forecasters and risk managers who relied on supposedly foolproof algorithms failed to see the crash coming. The historical economic data they fed into their computers didn't go back far enough. Their models weren't built to account for rare events. Yet, policy makers bought their rosy forecasts hook, line and sinker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might think that Nate Silver, the whiz-kid statistician who correctly predicted the winner of the 2012 U.S. presidential election in all 50 states, would be Big Data's biggest apologist. Instead, he warns against putting our faith in the predictive power of machines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our predictions may be more prone to failure in the era of Big Data,” The New York Times blogger writes in his recent book, The Signal and the Noise. “As there is an exponential increase in the amount of available information, there is likewise an exponential increase in the number of hypotheses to investigate … [But] most of the data is just noise, as most of the universe is filled with empty space.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the biggest risk we run in the era of Big Data is confusing correlation with causation – or rather, being duped by so-called “data scientists” who tell us one thing leads to another. The old admonition about “lies, damn lies and statistics” is more appropriate than ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thankfully, there is a recognition among some experts that Big Data has its downsides. A 2012 Pew Research Center survey of “stakeholders in the development of the Internet” found that four in 10 agreed that “Big Data will cause more problems than it solves by 2020 … and will engender false confidence in our predictive powers.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no doubt that Big Data has the awesome potential to make the world a better place. Health experts are salivating at the prospect of using huge datasets to track diseases and prevent epidemics. Physicians should be able prescribe medications more effectively. And thousands of lives could be saved by using more and better data to forecast the trajectory of hurricanes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for every step forward we take with Big Data, we may take two more back. In the wrong hands, the use and abuse of data can lead to disaster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Big Data will produce progress – eventually,” Mr. Silver says. “How quickly it does, and whether we regress in the meantime, will depend on us.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it always offensive to advise women to change something about themselves in order to ensure they can achieve their goals? To suggest the need for any self-scrutiny on women's part is a minefield; the safe ground is to urge that we remain focused only on fighting all-too-real discrimination. But sometimes it's necessary to cross the minefield.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, has done a gutsy thing. She's written a manifesto about breaking the glass ceiling, called Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, and drawn fire for arguing that women often sabotage themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics are already attacking Ms. Sandberg on the grounds that she is blaming the victim. Anne-Marie Slaughter, who wrote a much-read article about the glass ceiling last year, has sought an open debate about where the problems lie. Others, unfortunately, attack ad feminam: Ms. Sandberg is rich and powerful, so how can her advice be useful to struggling, underpaid everywomen?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Sandberg is seeking not just to raise consciousness, but to forge a social movement. She wants her “Lean In” circles – all-women spaces to be supported by corporate workplaces – to teach women negotiation, public speaking and other skills, all merged with upbeat collective support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I know that this seemingly trivial approach is actually a recipe for success. I co-founded a similar program called The Woodhull Institute; by teaching these skills and adding mutual support in an all-female space, our alumnae – whether from barrios or Ivy League universities – quickly and dramatically outpaced peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, however, they struggled to identify their own achievements in publicly making a case for themselves. That effort felt socially transgressive to them, almost painful. So the opportunity to learn and practise speaking and negotiating is hardly inconsequential for advancement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, as Ms. Sandberg rightly stresses, no one trains women in something as simple but critical as speaking in a strong, declarative voice. The range of inflections that are culturally valued in (especially young) women's voices are those that often undermine their authority in the workplace. So they often start presentations with an apology, use girlish inflections, end statements with question marks. But sounding fetchstingly unsure about what you are describing is not an effective way to pitch an idea to a potential investor, publisher or constituent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same truth also goes for body language, to which Ms. Sandberg also rightly pays attention. The talented young women I trained had great difficulty at first simply standing straight and tall; they often projected a lack of confidence physically, or simply looked as if they would rather be anywhere else than in the spotlight. Young men from elite backgrounds, by contrast, learn to project physical confidence as part of their birthright – just as they learn to speak in assertive, declarative voices and claim their achievements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So here is another tough fact: Institutional battles to redress women's underrepresentation in land ownership, politics, and so on must be coupled with individualized leadership and skills training for women, ideally in an atmosphere of mutual support in which women learn from peers how to achieve and enlarge their own goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This model shows amazing results for women, in contexts ranging from <span class="companylink">Smith College</span> to the <span class="companylink">Grameen Bank</span> to all-women job-training programs such as <span class="companylink">Nontraditional Employment for Women</span>, which trains women to break into highly skilled and high-paying, but traditionally all-male, blue-collar jobs. Likewise, Grace Belgravia, an all-female club, is attempting to rival the clout of London's elite men's clubs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The all-female peer group's emphasis on supporting women to be strong and achieve their goals is critical, as two young leaders, Courtney Martin and Katie Orenstein (both Woodhull Institute alumnae) recently noted. But, to realize Ms. Sandberg's vision of a social movement in which all-female groups support their members' efforts to make their own paths successful, we need to overcome obstacles in our own thinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The “post-feminist” view that there is no longer a need for all-women spaces needs to be challenged. There is also the question of how workplaces should respond if all-male groups wish to convene as well. My own view is that there is nothing wrong with some same-sex gatherings in a private setting, whereas in public contexts, discrimination is discrimination. Ms. Sandberg will have to explain her position on this issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more pressing obstacle, in a sense, is institutionalized feminism, which often finds it more comfortable to blame well-known villains and attack those who dare to call attention to women's need to learn for themselves the skills of securing and wielding power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's time to move on. We need both broad social analysis and leaders who'll take it upon themselves to help the next generation of women entrepreneurs and workers speak for themselves and get what they deserve.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. Liberal campaign director Mike McDonald, in his regular updates to party activists, searches for the good news to reassure his flock that the party is on track for victory.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a week like the past one, he had to dig deep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The week started with Liberal MLA Kevin Krueger calling the B.C. Conservatives “unmitigated morons” and “scum.” This didn't help efforts to bring conservatives back to the coalition party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then a leak of a breathtakingly cynical plan to woo ethnic voters revealed that the Premier's Office had worked on a plan to tap into government resources for the party's benefit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was too much for Premier Christy Clark's caucus – several MLAs publicly demanded that heads role. The Premier finally dumped a senior aide, but that act is unlikely to satisfy those in her party who continue to question whether she can lead the Liberals into the May 14 election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With all that as a backdrop, Mr. <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> recommended talking points focused on the party's latest awesome candidate nominations. He maintains that all the positive energy he sees – somehow missed by the pundits – “will manifest itself in votes, support and seats.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, increasingly, looks like wishful thinking. Some in the party still think a change of leadership could make a difference – with about six weeks until the campaign begins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the prospect of losing power after 12 years does, understandably, have the Liberals spooked. Poll analyst Eric Grenier puts the odds of the NDP winning the election at a little more than 95 per cent right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Premier's jobs plan was supposed to turn things around. Then, there was the Throne Speech and the budget last month. With the opportunities for manufacturing a “quick win” disappearing, there is one other thing the Liberals are hoping for: A big stumble by the New Democratic Party opposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It can happen. It did in the 1983 provincial election, when the governing Social Credit party started the campaign 10 points behind the NDP. On the day before the vote, the Vancouver Sun carried this headline: “It looks like an NDP win, experts say.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a fortuitous moment in front of a television camera earlier in the campaign changed the outcome for Premier Bill Bennett and his Socreds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We got off to a rocky start,” recalled Socred campaign manager Jerry Lampert in a recent interview. The premier had the flu and wasn't performing well. Their campaign was failing to connect with voters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Things were not good and our polling indicated not much was happening.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the stars aligned in his favour. The front-runner, NDP leader Dave Barrett, was at a party rally where he suggested he would tear up the Socred government's restraint package. The news barely created a ripple – at first. But the next day, Mr. Bennett was handed a unique opportunity to get in front of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It just happened at the time BCTV had purchased the first satellite truck, and it just happened to be in the same area where Bennett was campaigning,” Mr. Lampert said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his biography of the Socred premier, Tough Guy, Allen Garr recounted how BCTV's news desk managed to contact their reporter Clem Chapple in Invermere – by persuading someone at City Hall to search for him on the street. Mr. Chapple then persuaded Mr. Bennett's handlers to wake the groggy premier and get him to appear on their newscast, live, at noon. “Bennett put on his best performance of the campaign,” wrote Mr. Garr. He “poured it on with all the energy of a man who has been born again.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirty years later, Mr. Lampert still remembers watching the party's internal polling measure the results. “From that point on, the whole campaign turned around. We could see it in our daily tracking, and that was the election.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Socreds didn't just hang on to power – they ended up with more seats than before, and boosted their share of the popular vote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's B.C. Liberals can hope the NDP will trip up and will no doubt do their best to make that happen. But it's not much of a campaign strategy.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that few people believe him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speculation is rife around Ottawa that Mr. Flaherty, 63, is looking for a graceful exit after 18 years in federal and provincial politics – the past seven as Canada's Finance Minister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means the next federal budget, expected at the end of this month, may well be his last, and a final chance to cement his legacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combination of the hectic travel schedule, a high-pressure portfolio and his recent admission that he's on powerful drugs to treat a rare skin condition have apparently taken their toll. Mr. Flaherty no longer has the demeanour of a man digging in for another two years of tough deficit slogging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If he leaves this year, he won't be the guy who tamed the deficit. He missed his deficit target last year and the deficit grew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he won't be remembered as one of the transformative finance ministers of the past few decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think about Michael Wilson, who tilted the tax burden to consumers with the introduction of the goods and services tax, or Paul Martin, who spared Canada from debt default and ensured there would be a Canada Pension Plan for future generations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather, Mr. Flaherty has made his mark as a pragmatist in tough economic times – a fiscal conservative who grudgingly became a Big Government Keynesian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He has shown an important amount of flexibility,” argued <span class="companylink">McGill University</span> economist Chris Ragan, who worked for Mr. Flaherty as a visiting economist in 2009 and 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics have faulted Mr. Flaherty for being in denial as the financial crisis worsened in 2008. And then again in 2010, when he preached fiscal austerity to the <span class="companylink">Group of Seven</span> just before much of Europe slipped back into recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ragan sees it differently. He said Mr. Flaherty quickly shifted gears as facts changed, getting massive stimulus money out the door fast as the recession hit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He showed himself to be very Keynesian,” he pointed out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't his only policy flip-flop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After initially loosening mortgage rules, Mr. Flaherty switched gears and clamped down several times to cool excessive borrowing in the overheated real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also gets only partial marks for confronting the economics of an aging population. He raised the eligibility age for Old Age Security by two years. But he backed off a more ambitious plan to keep millions of retirees out of poverty by expanding the CPP, and he dumped a greater share of soaring health-care costs on the provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flaherty faces another spend-or-cut dilemma with this budget. Scott Clark, who worked for both Mr. Wilson and Mr. Martin as a top finance official in the 1990s, says Mr. Flaherty is ideologically bent on eliminating the deficit when key parts of the economy need propping up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What you have is a government that's caught in its own headlights,” said Mr. Clark, a former deputy finance minister. “The economy is struggling rather seriously . . . They are going to need to step in and provide a little support to this economy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A combination of external events and the tight grip of Prime Minister Stephen Harper means Mr. Flaherty has enjoyed far less independence than many of his predecessors, Mr. Clark said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Flaherty has had his legacy imposed on him,” Mr. Clark said. “I'm not sure he's been able to be an independent finance minister where he actually was running the budget or economic policy. Central command has basically been pulling his leash.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is still a lot left for Mr. Flaherty to do, beyond the deficit. There is the unfulfilled dream of a national securities regulator. Canada is also saddled with an inefficient and excessively complex tax regime that's too reliant on income taxes (made worse when the Conservatives slashed the GST).</p>

This is a tipping point for gay marriage in the United States, as the <span class="companylink">U.S. Supreme Court</span> prepares to hear two cases on gay marriage this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 75 Republicans have signed a friend-of-the-court brief to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Supreme Court</span> in support of gay marriage. Among these Republicans are four former state governors, former advisers to president George W. Bush and 2008 presidential candidate John McCain and two members of Congress.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At its heart, the conservative position is that gay marriage supports family and social stability. It strengthens the institution of marriage. And it is consistent with individual freedoms and limited government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why does the conservative position matter? Because it undermines one of the key justifications for excluding gay couples from civil marriage. In U.S. constitutional law, as in Canadian, there needs to be a demonstrated justification for leaving an individual or group outside of the law's usual commitment to equal protection. So what is that justification? Undermining families?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signatory Meg Whitman, a former New Jersey governor, quotes Conservative British Prime Minister David Cameron: “Conservatives believe in the ties that bind us; that society is stronger when we make vows to each other and support each other. So I don't support gay marriage despite being a conservative. I support gay marriage because I am a conservative.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, more than 200 U.S. corporations, including Apple, <span class="companylink">Johnson &amp; Johnson</span>, <span class="companylink">Walt Disney</span>, <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, have signed a brief in support of gay marriage. The brief argues that the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which bars federal benefits to gay couples, imposes large administrative costs on companies who are forced to treat gay couples under a different set of rules. Many of those companies have also said publicly that they believe all employees should be treated equally under the law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two briefs, taken together, pose a major challenge to the Republican Party, which still opposes gay marriage. “The party of Lincoln should stand with our best tradition of equality and support full marriage,” former Utah governor Jon Huntsman, a signatory to the Republican brief, wrote in an article called “Marriage Equality is a Conservative Cause.” Even more important, the briefs pose a question that the Supreme Court may have trouble answering: What is the legal justification for continuing to exclude gay couples from marriage?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday, March 05, 2013</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An editorial Monday on same-sex marriage incorrectly referred to Meg Whitman as a former New Jersey governor. In fact, she was an unsuccessful candidate for governor in California.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. position, or more accurately non-position, is a veritable case study of diplomat-speak. John Kerry, the new U.S. Secretary of State made a stop in London last week to underscore the “special relationship” between those two countries. It is not so special, however. If it were, the U.S. would approve the democratic rights of Falkland Islanders to self-determination. Said Mr. Kerry, “Our position on the Falklands has not changed. The United States recognizes de facto U.K. administration of the islands but takes no position on the question of parties' sovereignty claims thereto. We support co-operation between U.K. and Argentina on practical matters.”</p>

Canada stood alone in arguing that the Falkland Islanders should be allowed to decide their own future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inhabitants of the Falklands go to the polls on March 10-11. They will be asked, “Do you wish the Falkland Islands to retain their current political status as an Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom?” It's a clear question, and there is little doubt as to the outcome. There is no desire to see the islands ruled by Argentina. The people will have spoken. The Argentines won't accept that, but the U.S. should.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It seems like they find different ways to win. They've got good goaltending, a great defence and some guys up front that do some damage. They have depth scoring as well. Right now they seem like they have the whole package.” <span class="companylink">Detroit Red Wings</span> defenceman Niklas Kronwall said this about the <span class="companylink">Chicago Blackhawks</span> to MichiganLive.com shortly before his team blew a chance to hand them their first regulation-time loss this season.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*********</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> season heads toward the halfway mark this week, one of the biggest surprises is the <span class="companylink">Chicago Blackhawks</span>, who simply refuse to lose in regulation time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collectively and individually, the <span class="companylink">Blackhawks</span> dominate the surprise list so far this season, from their record of getting points in the first 22 games of the season to the re-emergence of forward Patrick Kane. Losing isn't in this team's vocabulary, as the <span class="companylink">Detroit Red Wings</span> found out Sunday when Kane scored a dramatic goal late in the third period to force overtime and then notched the only goal in the shootout for a 2-1 decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going back to a regulation loss on Mar. 25, 2012, it was the 28th consecutive game in which the <span class="companylink">Blackhawks</span> earned a point, which is the second-longest in <span class="companylink">NHL</span> history, matching the <span class="companylink">Montreal Canadiens</span>' run over two seasons in 1977-78. The <span class="companylink">Philadelphia Flyers</span> hold the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> record with a stretch of 35 consecutive games with at least a point in the 1979-80 season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the lockout finally ended and the 48-game season began on Jan. 20, the <span class="companylink">Blackhawks</span> did not appear on most projections for the Western Conference and Stanley Cup finals. The <span class="companylink">St. Louis Blues</span> and defending Cup champion <span class="companylink">Los Angeles Kings</span> were the darlings of the prognosticators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Blackhawks</span> were probably dismissed because general manager Stan Bowman did not make any significant changes to a lineup that finished sixth in the Western Conference last season, albeit with 101 points. But the Hawks bowed out of the playoffs in the first round in each of the last two years after winning the Stanley Cup in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bowman elected not to tinker much with the lineup and the players rewarded him and head coach Joel Quenneville. Kane managed to put aside a worrisome trend of headlines about his off-ice partying and start scoring on the ice with 26 points in 22 games, while captain Jonathan Toews and right winger Marian Hossa are also dominating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Duncan Keith, Brent Seabrook and the surprising Johnny Oduya (plus-10) lead the best defence corps in the league, which has helped Corey Crawford and Ray Emery become the best goaltending tandem in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> with a combined 1.73 goals-against average, well ahead of the second-place <span class="companylink">Anaheim Ducks</span> (2.65).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They seem to win by accident right now, they're that good,” <span class="companylink">Red Wings</span> head coach Mike Babcock told MichiganLive.com just before his team had its chance to hand the <span class="companylink">Blackhawks</span> their first regulation loss snatched away. “They're at a whole different level than anybody else in the West.” The <span class="companylink">Blackhawks</span>' defensive prowess extends to their special teams, where they were second in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> in penalty killing as of Sunday with a success rate of 89.7 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think it's the best back end in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>, by far,” Babcock said of the Chicago defence. “They've got five guys who can really skate and play and move the puck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Kane is having a much better year. Toews is always what he is. Hossa's a star. [Patrick] Sharp's a real solid guy. They got lots of quality players, as much depth as anybody.” Perhaps the best move Bowman made in the off-season was to have a chat with Kane about his extra-curricular activities. After an epic weekend in the college town of Madison, Wis., saw images of Kane all over social media last May, Bowman decided to act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I've always found the best way to motivate people is to connect with them as opposed to try to read them the riot act,” Bowman told the <span class="companylink">Chicago Tribune</span>. “We explained to him, ‘Your circumstance in Chicago is different than even a lot of your teammates. You have to accept that.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It has taken some time because since he was 12 he has been someone when he walks by, people turn and whisper. A prodigy. Sometimes it's the naiveté of youth. He has said to me, ‘I just want to be a regular guy.' I say, ‘But you're not.' I think now he's like, I know, I understand. In some ways, he has learned the hard way.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CROSBY LEADS MVP HUNT IN SHORTENED SEASON</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sidney Crosby is back in a familiar spot as the halfway mark of the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s 48-game season approaches – the leading candidate for the Hart Trophy as the league's most valuable player.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Evgeni Malkin just back to practising with his teammates on Sunday after sustaining a concussion 10 days ago, Crosby led the <span class="companylink">Pittsburgh Penguins</span> to second place in the Eastern Conference as of Sunday by scoring 34 points in 22 games. That is just ahead of another Hart contender, Steven Stamkos of the <span class="companylink">Tampa Bay Lightning</span>, who has 32 points and leads the league in goals with 15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also in the MVP hunt are Patrick Kane of the <span class="companylink">Chicago Blackhawks</span>, whose 26 points includes a lot of key goals, and goaltender Pekka Rinne of the <span class="companylink">Nashville Predators</span>. Rinne's stats are not at the top of the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> lists (his 2.10 goals-against average was eighth on Sunday) but without him the Predators and their pop-gun offence (last in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> at 2.00 goals per game) would not be eighth in the Western Conference before Sunday's games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kris Letang of the Penguins is getting notice for the James Norris Trophy as the best defenceman because he is the leading points-getter among blue-liners with 19. However, keep an eye on Niklas Kronwall of the <span class="companylink">Detroit Red Wings</span>, who has 17 points and is playing well enough to cushion the impact of Nicklas Lidstrom's retirement. Kronwall could get the nod from the voters because he is the best two-way player among the leading defencemen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Tampa Bay Lightning</span> forward Cory Conacher and his 18 points made him the runaway favourite for the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year so far but Jonathan Huberdeau of the <span class="companylink">Florida Panthers</span> is making a strong bid. Huberdeau, 19, ran up nine points in 13 games to be named the league's rookie of the month for February and he now has 13 points in 21 games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul MacLean was a finalist for the Jack Adams Trophy last season as a rookie head coach, losing the coach-of-the-year award to Ken Hitchcock of the <span class="companylink">St. Louis Blues</span>. But there is no sophomore slump for him, as MacLean has the <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span> a solid fifth in the Eastern Conference despite a long list of injuries to key players including Erik Karlsson and Jason Spezza.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also in the hunt with MacLean are Joel Quenneville of the <span class="companylink">Blackhawks</span>, Claude Julien of the <span class="companylink">Boston Bruins</span> and Bruce Boudreau of the <span class="companylink">Anaheim Ducks</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The connection between obesity and osteoarthritis – a progressive degeneration of joint cartilage that affects 10 per cent of Canadian adults – seems obvious. Every extra kilogram of body weight puts an extra load of about four kilograms on your knees, for example, so the extra wear and tear erodes the joints. Simple and straightforward.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But why, then, is osteoarthritis of the hand – containing non-load-bearing joints – also twice as common in obese people?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the riddle at the heart of a debate currently flaring up in academic journals, between researchers who hold the traditional view of osteoarthritis as a product of purely mechanical forces, and those who believe that inflammatory signals triggered by conditions like obesity can play a key role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As evidence for the latter view piles up, traditional scapegoats like running are getting a new look – and a new long-term study of 90,000 people suggests that running may actually help, not hurt, your joints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For a long time [osteoarthritis] has been believed to be primarily mechanical,” says Richard Aspden, head of the Musculoskeletal Research Program at the <span class="companylink">University of Aberdeen</span> in Scotland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“However, the biological-origin camp are gaining ground. I guess the truth is probably somewhere in between.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key to the new view is that fat tissue isn't just an inert substance that accumulates in inconvenient places in our bodies. Instead, it's metabolically active: “a rich source of pro-inflammatory endocrine factors,” as Aspden put it in a 2011 review of the topic in the journal Nature Reviews: Rheumatology, which can trigger changes throughout the body, including in joints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One example of the endocrine factors produced by fat tissue is leptin, best known as an appetite hormone. Researchers at the <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span> recently measured leptin levels in 543 middle-aged women. The results, which will appear in a forthcoming issue of Arthritis Case &amp; Research, show that subjects with higher leptin levels were more likely to develop knee osteoarthritis during the 10-year follow-up period, even after adjusting the results to control for body weight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such results have raised hopes that osteoarthritis could be treated by directly attacking some of these endocrine factors. Initial studies of this approach haven't yet been successful (though a Belgian study published last year did show potential for slowing the progression of finger osteoarthritis), possibly because so many different hormones and other substances are involved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's clear that mechanical factors also play a role in the disease. For example, one of the clearest risk factors is suffering an acute joint injury. That's why studies of soccer and hockey players invariably show an elevated risk of developing osteoarthritis in later life: When athletes who have suffered acute injuries are removed from consideration, that risk mostly disappears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, studies now show that the traditional view of cartilage as an inert substance that can't respond to extra demands is also incorrect. Regular exercise can actually lead to a thickening of the cartilage layer, whereas prolonged inactivity results in thinning cartilage – another example of the “use it or lose it” dictum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this suggests that the results of another new study, to be published in Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise, shouldn't actually be surprising. Paul Williams of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California has been following a huge cohort of runners and walkers since 1991, and his latest study analyzes osteoarthritis risk in 90,000 of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In brief, he found that those running more than 12 kilometres a week were 18.1 per cent less likely to develop osteoarthritis and 35.1 per cent less likely to need a hip replacement during the study's seven-year follow-up, compared with those running less than that amount. Even those who ran considerably more – there were 863 subjects who ran more than 96 km per week – had similarly reduced rates of osteoarthritis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previous studies have found essentially the same thing: A 2008 <span class="companylink">Stanford University</span> study, for example, followed 45 runners and 53 matched non-running controls for 18 years; 20 per cent of the runners and 32 per cent of the non-runners developed knee osteoarthritis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further analysis of Williams's results showed that the protective effect of running was almost entirely due to its role in lowering BMI in the subjects. Those who ran (or walked) more weighed less, and consequently had healthier joints. “The evidence seems to suggest [running] is good for you,” Aspden agrees. “Even when osteoarthritis has started, the suggestion is to keep exercising, albeit preferably low-impact – but gentle jogging isn't ruled out.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Williams's study can't determine whether it's the lower weight or the fat-induced inflammation that's more important; it will take years for scientists to reach any definitive conclusion in that debate. But the epidemiological evidence is already clear: Avoiding physical activity – even high-impact activities such as running – to “preserve” your joints is a losing strategy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RETHINKING KNEE PAIN</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Osteoarthritis has traditionally been viewed as a consequence of physical “wear and tear” on joint cartilage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But inflammatory signals produced elsewhere in the body – such as fat tissue – may also play a role in the disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condition can occur in any joint in the body. It most commonly affects the fingers, knees, hips and spine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INSIDE THE KNEE JOINT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Osteoarthritis affects all joints the same way. Cartilage lines the ends of bones where they meet. It acts as a shock absorber and bumper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ARTHRITIC KNEE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As cartilage wears away, the joint no longer moves smoothly because the bones can rub together. The result</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">is pain, stiffness and swelling.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians are open to blowing the whistle on bodychecking in minor hockey.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new survey conducted on behalf of the Rick Hansen Institute says that four out of five Canadian adults consider the national game an excellent activity for children, but:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• 87 per cent feel that hockey carries a “significant risk” of head, neck and brain injury, higher than football (82 per cent), skiing/snowboarding (74 per cent) or soccer (28 per cent).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• 88 per cent – including 75 per cent of hockey parents and 86 per cent of those who consider themselves fans – would support a national policy that eliminated bodychecking at the peewee level (11 and 12).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• 82 per cent – including 62 per cent of the parents and 79 per cent of fans – would support such a ban at the bantam level (13 and 14).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• 67 per cent of hockey parents know someone who has suffered a concussion or serious head, neck, back or brain injury while playing hockey, as opposed to 32 per cent aware of such an injury from football, 16 per cent from soccer and 9 per cent from mixed martial arts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That is an amazing number,” Dr. Charles Tator, founder of ThinkFirst Canada and project director of the Canadian Sports Concussion Project at the Krembil Neuroscience Centre at Toronto Western Hospital, says of the 67-per-cent statistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tator, one of the world's leading experts on concussion, points out that the number reflects the popularity of the winter game, but also the growing national conversation on safety in hockey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It reflects what I hear in my own environment from parents who are very concerned about the concussion issue in hockey,” Tator says. “It indicates we've done a pretty good job of making people aware that there is a problem with concussions in many sports, not just hockey.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute's survey was conducted online by Angus Reid Public Opinion between Feb. 22 and 26. The survey involved 2,017 Canadian adults who are Angus Reid Forum panelists and was broken down into three samples: 1,013 randomly selected adults, 502 parents of children playing on a hockey team, and 502 adults who consider themselves fans of the game. According to the pollster, the margin of error in such a survey would be plus or minus 3.1 per cent from the sample of Canadian adults, and plus or minus 4.5 per cent for each of the two smaller groupings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Barrable, chief executive officer of the Rick Hansen Institute, says the institute commissioned the survey “because spinal cord and traumatic brain injuries never completely heal. They are damage which has permanent long-term consequences and are a very significant public health and youth safety issue in this country.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian Paediatric Society and other groups have recommended that bodychecking in all hockey leagues be delayed until 15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Support for this cutoff was surprising in that 77 per cent of Canadians – including 67 per cent of hockey parents and 79 per cent of hockey fans – would back such a change. Opposition to such a proposal was relatively low, with 31 per cent of hockey parents against such a rule, and 19 per cent of fans opposing it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked what effect the elimination of bodychecking under 15 would have on the game itself, 62 per cent of adults thought “better off” while 50 per cent of hockey parents felt the same. Only 8 per cent of adults thought the game would be “worse off,” while 21 per cent of hockey parents thought it would be bad for the game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The highest level of support occurred in British Columbia (86 per cent) and lowest was found in Alberta (73 per cent). Intriguingly, these are the two provinces most recently involved in a debate over taking body contact out of peewee hockey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no bodychecking allowed at the peewee level in Quebec or in the United States. Studies have found the rate of concussions at this level of play is significantly reduced if full body contact is not allowed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Richard Stanwick, the Victoria-based president of the Canadian Paediatric Society, says there is no suggestion that children be kept out of hockey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We want to encourage,” he says. “The Canadian Paediatric Society has come out about the necessity of combatting the obesity epidemic, and hockey is an amazing sport where you not only develop skill sets and exercise, but it's something that likely will stay with you. Just look at the popularity of old-timer hockey leagues.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, he adds, the game needs to be made safer for those at such a vulnerable age: “The concern about concussion is that not only can you get concussed out of the game, you can get concussed out of life.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tator adds: “My personal view is that the scientific evidence is mounting that the young brain is more vulnerable to concussion than the older brain. The evidence is now pointing to the adolescent brain as being most vulnerable. It used to be thought that the infant brain or the toddler brain was most susceptible. But now it would seem that the older group, the adolescent brain, is the more vulnerable age.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tator says it is known that ages 13 to 15 are a “tender brain age, and it makes sense to be concerned for that age group.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stanwick says: “Brain reaches maximum size at age 12, then starts pruning and focusing on areas of special development. It's an amazing time where there's unbelievable elasticity in the brain.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He believes this is “a time when rules are really needed. The worst thing you can do is disrupt that process with a concussion.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His group would favour the elimination of bodychecking at all levels of house league and non-elite hockey. If these youngsters are going to continue playing for life – something the Paediatric Society encourages – it will be in non-contact leagues anyway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In supporting the ban proposed by the society, Barrable, CEO of the Rick Hansen Institute, says such a move could “save Canada's health-care system millions of dollars in treatment and rehab care.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We wouldn't drive our car into a wall at 25 kilometres an hour because it would cause considerable damage,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Why would we continue to support rules which have our children crashing into a wall at the same speed when we know they can often suffer long-term damage?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such a rule change, if deemed necessary, could come about in two ways, according to Paul Carson, Hockey Canada's vice-president of hockey development. The Hockey Canada board of directors could vote on a motion received from the annual general meeting – as happened when new rules on head contact came in and the organization adopted its “zero tolerance” policy on head shots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The branches also have autonomy to set their own regulations, as happened with Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hockey Canada is aware of the controversy concerning bodychecking and, so far, has left it to the branches to decide for themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the more curious findings in the poll is that 7 per cent of those hockey parents surveyed believe their child has the potential to play professional hockey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“One out of 3,000 kids makes it,” Stanwick says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other intriguing findings: have children play with their specific year group rather than in two-year spans where, at the peewee and bantam levels, vast differences in growth are found. Support for such a change includes 71 per cent of Canadians, 66 per cent of hockey parents and 71 per cent of fans, while 29 per cent of parents would oppose such a change and 4 per cent are not sure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's an important issue,” Tator says. “One kid being up to the waist of the other and yet they're only a year-and-a-half apart. You would minimize the size, height and weight discrepancies if you limited the categories to one year. If you've got the numbers, you might as well.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also support for a wider ice surface than the regulation NHL rink of 200 feet by 85 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hockey parents are particularly keen on this suggestion, with 74 per cent in favour and only 8 per cent opposed. The same number of fans would also favour the larger ice surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broken down further, 46 per cent of parents would prefer the Olympic ice surface (15 feet wider), 16 per cent widening it by 10 feet and 12 per cent in support of a rink five feet wider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We know there are fewer collisions and fewer concussions when international hockey rinks are in play,” Tator says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Stanwick's opinion, the elimination of bodychecking at the lower levels would maintain what the game is supposed to be about in the first place: fun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's still going to be a rough and tumble sport,” he says. “But it isn't a blood sport or mixed martial arts.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Gatekeepers, the Israeli documentary and Oscar nominee featuring interviews with six former heads of Shin Bet (the security service responsible for domestic security and counter-terrorism) – is startling in its candour. It questions black-and-white assumptions about “good guys” and “bad guys” and introduces the grey world inhabited by these men. It exposes Israel's super-sophisticated anti-terrorism machine, but admits failures and the limitations of power. And it demonstrates, once again, Israel's remarkably open debate on the most sensitive issues.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the film hasn't generated significant public pressure on what Shin Bet's former heads say is the most important issue of all – putting an end to Israel's continued occupation of more than two million West Bank Palestinians. Like the recent election campaign, the protracted negotiations under way to form a new coalition government also give short shrift to the issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Gatekeepers is the latest in a string of Israeli documentaries that question conventional military and political wisdom, often through conversations with people who served deep inside the system. Along with, for example, 5 Broken Cameras (also a 2012 nominee), Waltz with Bashir (a 2009 nominee) and The Law in These Parts, it fills a vacuum left by mass media increasingly populated by right-wing voices and reality shows with high ratings. (The country's largest circulation daily, Israel Hayom, is free and bankrolled by American billionaire Sheldon Adelson, a staunch supporter of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Mitt Romney's biggest financial backer.) The Law in These Parts, named last year's World Cinema Grand Jury Prize in Documentary at Sundance, is a counterpart to The Gatekeepers and presents stark interviews with former military legal officials responsible for the judicial architecture governing the Israeli occupation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What makes The Gatekeepers unique is its subjects' unmediated intimacy with Palestinians – prisoners, informants and political leaders. With one exception, all those interviewed spent decades in the Shin Bet, immersed in the minutiae of Palestinian life and politics. No Israeli, including senior politicians, knows Palestinians as well as they do. As result of this, their discussion of legal constraints and moral dilemmas, and their acknowledgment of Palestinian thinking and motivation are especially striking. Their uniform conclusion is that while fighting terror is an absolute necessity, it won't improve Israel's strategic situation absent a change in the political status quo. Coming from the heart of Israel's security establishment, their statement is loud and clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeing the film outside its Israeli context emphasizes the centrality of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict – but Israelis see it differently. Since the 2000 failed Camp David talks and subsequent rash of suicide bombings, and fuelled by Hamas attacks after the 2005 evacuation from Gaza, they've been fed a steady diet of “there's no one to talk to” by politicians across the spectrum. About 70 per cent of Israelis accept a “two states for two peoples” solution to the conflict, but at least as many distrust the current Palestinian leadership. Younger Israelis, in particular, take settlements for granted and have no idea what the “Green Line” (demarcating Israel's pre-1967 borders) means.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, coalition talks remain mired in domestic issues because the mantra of “there's no one to talk to” lets Israeli politicians off the hook. Besides, Iran and Syria loom far larger. But Ami Ayalon (Shin Bet chief from 1996 to 2000) says he and his colleagues used the film, made by Israelis for Israelis, as “a microphone” to get a different message across. He acknowledges that he doesn't know whether or when his fellow citizens will listen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four of the men spoke in a joint interview as early as 2003, after leaving the service. None of them tried to influence policy while on their watch. In the film, one intimates that this would have been beyond their mandate; another hints at the wisdom of hindsight; and a third describes Yitzhak Rabin's assassination as a crushing blow from which the process never recovered. On Iran, in contrast, there's been no such hesitation. Last year, current and past security and military chiefs succeeded in delaying – and perhaps cancelling – Israeli military action. But the Palestinian issue hits too many raw nerves of history, identity, settler power and coalition politics for officials to take on while in the service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Netanyahu hastened to announce he has no intention of seeing The Gatekeepers. Perhaps he should reconsider. The film's release coincides with renewed discussion on how to revive defunct Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. While compelling reasons on both sides may render this difficult or even impossible, the film is a stark reminder of the cost of doing nothing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Get out the knives and sharpen them. There's news on the Jay Leno front.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The word came down on the weekend. According to The Hollywood Reporter, NBC is ready to replace Jay Leno as host of The Tonight Show and put Jimmy Fallon in his place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NBC has officially denied the details in the report, but the trade magazine stands behind its story and quotes, anonymously, several NBC insiders as confirming that the network fears losing the 18-49 demographic to Jimmy Kimmel on ABC (who now competes directly with Leno) and wants Fallon in fast, to stop the bleeding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Jay Leno never goes quietly. As the Reporter says, “Anyone with even a passing sense of Leno's personality knows that the hard-working comic would be reluctant to leave his perch, especially before his rival at CBS, David Letterman, announces his retirement. Leno and Letterman are both signed through 2014.” The idea, according to the sources quoted, is that NBC will announce at the May Upfront that Leno will leave in 2014, with Fallon talking over during the summer next year and formally launching a new, invigorated Tonight Show in fall 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are two rich veins of approach to this latest possible skirmish in the ongoing late-night wars. First, there's the vastness of Leno hatred. Second, there's NBC, like all networks, desperately trying to save itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As always with Leno, negative news about him incites glee. “Time to usurp the throne from Grandpa, Jimmy!” crowed Perez Hilton. The industry's perception of Leno is now one of rock-solid loathing. It's based on this version of events in the late-night wars – Leno booted Johnny Carson to the curb early to get the Tonight Show job; he screwed Letterman, who was Carson's choice; and he undermined Conan O'Brien, who took the job after Leno, with Leno all the while scheming to return to The Tonight Show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report that Leno goes and Fallon comes in is utterly plausible. Time has caught up with Leno. Everybody involved is looking to the future and the future means retirement time. If David Letterman retires in 2014, as expected, CBS could and would lure Jimmy Fallon from the 12:35 a.m. slot on NBC to 11:35 p.m. on CBS. Just as CBS managed to attract a bitter, disillusioned Letterman from NBC to a new 11:35 show to compete with Leno in 1993.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leno does reasonably well for NBC now, but he's a codger-magnet. Younger viewers are watching The Daily Show, The Colbert Report, Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon. And Fallon, for all his fresh-faced boyishness, has heft. His recent adventures with Michelle Obama on his show went viral in a manner that Leno never does – a <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> clip of Obama dancing on Fallon's show has 14 million views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But more important perhaps for NBC is its need to avert a perceived complete slide toward oblivion. There are four major networks in the U.S. market and for the recent February sweeps period NBC slid not into fourth place but into fifth – it actually had fewer viewers than the Spanish-language Univision channel. There were more people watching the talent shows and telenovelas on Univision than watching the hyped dramas and sitcoms on NBC. It's a mortifying predicament for NBC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To put the network's failings in further perspective, it is getting murdered in the ratings by cable series. Last Wednesday, almost nine million people in the United States watched the opening episode of the third season of the laid-back redneck reverie Duck Dynasty on A&amp;E. As The Washington Post pointed out, “That's a bigger crowd than achieved by any of NBC's prime-time shows on any night last week. NBC's most-watched series, Chicago Fire, averaged 6.5 million viewers.” Ouch and double ouch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the knives are always out for Leno, this isn't just a late-night war. NBC needs a hit, any kind of hit. Pronto.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April last year, Dominic Moore, a centre with the <span class="companylink">San Jose Sharks</span>, disappeared from hockey in the final two Stanley Cup playoff games against the <span class="companylink">St. Louis Blues</span>. Fans were surprised. Only two months earlier, he had been traded from the <span class="companylink">Tampa Bay Lightning</span>. Later in June, the reason was revealed. Katie Moore, his wife of less than two years, had been diagnosed with a rare form of liver cancer.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, for the first time since his departure from the ice, the Canadian-born NHL veteran is speaking publicly about it. “Katie is an avid writer. A very reflective person,” he begins. I don't point out that he's using the present tense. She died Jan. 7, at the age of 32. It had been less than a month since her death when he reached out to speak about the shock, illness, hope and fortitude that had marked their last nine months together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“She would have wanted to share her story,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grief is its own animal. You can never know how it will act, what it will make you feel or want to do, until it has you in its grip. It's different for everyone. What spills out from Moore is the need to bring her back – the desire to, anyway – to play back what happened, to slow it down and understand it, because when you're in the midst of it, everything goes so fast, and when the end comes, it is always so final.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if this is a story about personal grief over the loss of a vivacious and spirited woman, it is also one about the hockey family and the relationships that lie behind the game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Moore family has certainly had their share of hardship. Dominic Moore is the youngest son of three, and grew up in Thornhill, Ont. Mark, Steve and Dominic all went to <span class="companylink">Harvard University</span> to play hockey, the first brother trio to play on the school's varsity hockey team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark never played in the NHL, choosing to go to law school. Steve Moore did, and tragically became a cautionary tale about the dangers of the sport. In 2004, in an infamous incident of violence, he was hit from behind by Todd Bertuzzi during a game between the <span class="companylink">Vancouver Canucks</span> and the <span class="companylink">Colorado Avalanche</span>, suffering a concussion and broken vertebrae in his neck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He has never been the same,” Dominic Moore says. A lawsuit is still pending. There has been no compensation. “He and his wife are supporting themselves. But that's a tale for another time.” He pauses momentarily. “No one has a say in what events happen to us.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moore, now an unrestricted free agent, is speaking on the phone from Boston, where he and his wife had decided to make their home. His NHL career had taken him to a new city almost every year for the previous 10 years. But they had met at Harvard and had been together ever since. Boston was the landscape of their love affair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An athlete herself, Katie had been selected in high school in a small town in Minnesota, where she grew up, for the Olympic regional soccer team; she went on to play the sport at Harvard. “She was not one of those wives to sit in the wives' room. She was always in the stands.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of how they coped with the instability of hockey life was to find a home where they could think about having children and Katie could write the novel she had started. They had bought a “dream unit” in a building in Boston in the fall of 2011. They could not have known what the future held. Last spring, while in San Jose, Katie fell ill, unable to keep food down. Scans and a biopsy confirmed the worst: fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma, a rare form of liver cancer that often afflicts younger people. It had spread to the lymph nodes and there were tumours elsewhere in her body. The morning after the diagnosis, she underwent an eight-hour “aggressive surgery” to remove her stomach, her gallbladder and all the lymph nodes in her abdomen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“She had no hesitation whatsoever. She was incredible,” Moore recalls, adding that she emulated the positive attitude of her father, who had died unexpectedly a year earlier. As it was a cancer that had no specific chemotherapy treatment, she would have to undergo experimental trials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His departure from the game was easy, he says, even during the playoffs, which he had already been in for two years in a row, with the <span class="companylink">Tampa Bay Lightning</span> in 2011 and the <span class="companylink">Montreal Canadiens</span> in 2010. “There's a sense that when you take time off, you're not pulling your weight. But at the same time, family comes first.” To him, the lockout was “a blessing” because at the least he didn't feel as though he was missing anything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By June, they had moved back to Boston, where her care continued at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. She continued to work tirelessly on the renovations for their dream home. During the month of August, when she had to be in the hospital, Moore stayed with her every night. Their condo was ready for them to move in but “I wanted to go home with her,” he explains. In early September, they did, and he videotaped their crossing of the threshold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout, they never hesitated to try anything doctors recommended. “Neither of us would ever admit defeat. It's not in our natures,” he says, as he documents the heartbreaking ups and downs of her condition over that summer and fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I ask him if any of that attitude comes from sports psychology. “I don't think it has to do with being an athlete. At the end of the day, sports is about whether you win or you lose. But none of us is getting out of here alive. It's about the character, the spirit you show. People like Lance Armstrong are called a winner because they beat cancer. But millions of people who fight, and even fight harder than most, still die from cancer.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end, he was by her side, holding her hand. In hospital since late November, she was weak, unable to speak. A few hours before she died, he made a move to get up to leave momentarily. But “she squeezed my hand. So I sat right back down,” he says. She died with her eyes open. “She was afraid that if she closed her eyes, she wouldn't wake up.” Doctors had given her drugs to help her sleep. “But they didn't work. She had this inhuman strength.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not Moore, the professional hockey player, who is talking to me. I have interviewed some over the years, and it's always a difficult exercise. They rarely speak about themselves. It's always about the team, the play, the passes, the goals, the chances, the misses. Moore is without protective gear as he speaks, simply a husband who is easing into his role as a grieving widower. “We were incredibly lucky to have the relationship we had,” he continues, eager to tell me everything about her. “We had something special … Pure unadulterated love. Every day, we were grateful to have each other.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I get a word in edgewise to ask whether he will sign with a team soon. “There have been options offered. But I'm not at this point accepting them.” He pauses. “I need to take some time.” And then he swings the conversation back to Katie. “I told her near the end that her father would be very proud of her. It was his last fatherly act to have shown her the way.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technology historian George Dyson once summed up things this way – “In the game of life and evolution, there are three players at the table: human beings, nature and machines.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone venturing to guess which one is winning might start with some of the basics. Stuff like what is happening to our reading culture, the art of conversation, the practice of writing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Machines, you might say, are faring rather well on these fronts. They've turned us all into screenheads. All those conversation avoidance devices, the texting and twittering gizmos, means we can escape the bother of talking. It was a nice pastime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too bad for reading culture, too. It's being overtaken by the watching culture – the videoization of everything. Reading books demands willed attention, whereas screenheads are conditioned to have the attention spans of grasshoppers. Heads bowed, they trundle along with their handheld devices scrolling for infotainment delights, looking up just in time to dodge telephone poles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Writing is still around but it, too, is taking a hit from modern machinery's advances. We now learn that they don't even teach cursive in schools any more. Little Johnny will have fewer things to get in trouble over. In fact, the sophistication of software is reaching the point where we won't have to write in any form. We can just talk or shout at our screens and our words will appear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not to be facetious, but with reading, speaking and writing on the decline, we may have a bit of an issue on our hands. It's not the economy, dumbo. It's the culture that's the story, our submissiveness to cyber-world dictates and wherever they choose to lead us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some parents try to limit handheld device time for themselves and their kids to half a day or so. But there are no new Luddites out there and few slow-down advocates either. Most of our politicians are mum. They take a laissez-techno-faire attitude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To suggest, as some have, that we are doubling down on dumbing down with our digital fixations is excessive. Internet technologies bring a myriad of advantages, putting all the world's libraries at our fingertips. It can't be that we are witnessing the shallowing of the modern mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the digital revolution can hardly be said to be inducing a climate of erudition either. On Saturday, Ian Brown reported in this paper on how our history is now being taught and distorted – gamed, you might say – by video games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite all the viewpoints that have become readily accessible, new technologies are being found to reinforce prejudice. Our website warriors can find a ton of material to confirm their beliefs. They find comfort in their echo chambers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, strangely enough, the opinion-saturated Internet world leaves little room for nuance. Everyone has access to a soapbox, and in the cacophonous din, only the loudest shouters are heard. There used to be filters to separate the wheat from the chaff. Now that many of the filters have been removed – for example, allowing online posters to peddle their vitriol anonymously – the way is left clear for cyberbullies. You get what John Manley has called “a culture of name, blame and shame.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exhibit A is the world's cultural trailblazer, the United States. The debate there has become more polarized and poisonous than ever before. Viewers have moved away from the more moderate-minded CNN to Fox News ranters on the right and MSNBC ranters on the left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here in Canada, there's a debate over whether the CRTC should give the staunchly conservative Sun News Network more prominent placement on the TV dial to increase its audience. Do that, some say, and provide for a Canadian equivalent of MSNBC on the left. But unless we want a media environment like the United States, we don't need that. What we need is more debate on the reckoning – where the digital revolution is taking us and what, if anything, can be done to harness it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the game of humans, nature and machines, let not machines be the winner.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was an out-of season Calgary Stampede last week when institutions to which Tom Flanagan had given important parts of his life fell over one another to distance themselves from him. This social lynching by moral panic revealed the self-righteousness and censorious eagerness to condemn that lies perpetually just below the surface of Canadian public opinion. And, of course, Prof. Flanagan is just a bit too clever, revels a bit too obviously in the public eye and takes a bit too much pleasure in tilting at the sacred cows of our politics to expect any slack.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But of what does he stand condemned? He raised an issue of principle that is at least arguably worthy of discussion, but he was heard to have endorsed behaviour that we all detest. A person of his experience might have known better, but publicly airing doubts on such issues is part of a healthy public life. Canadians swear they are looking for men and women of principle as leaders, until they meet one whose principles they do not like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prof. Flanagan's sin boils down to this: Like many academics, but unlike most conservatives, he imagined (at least in this case) that moral issues in public life turn upon abstract notions of justice and rights – fairness, philosophically construed. But, as social psychologists Jonathan Haidt and Selin Kesebir argue, such notions are only a part of moral debate. Another important part – which many to his left felt Mr. Flanagan underestimated – is concern for the suffering of others. And, say professors Haidt and Kesebir, there are other, practical considerations that move citizens: respect for authority, group loyalty and commitment to purity, sanctity and moral self-discipline. It was on the rocks of these less “reasonable” – in the sense of rationally manageable – moral dimensions that Prof. Flanagan ran aground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This country is chronically short of people prepared to put their heads above the parapet. Now, we likely have one fewer. The high-minded will rejoice at another effective policing action over freedom of debate. The many Canadians who claim to support human rights will once again have failed to understand that rights are also for the unpopular and the unwelcome. In fact, the “one less” above is likely an underestimate – anyone else with doubts about the shibboleths we use to identify the worthy will now think twice about expressing them. But we are clear, if we were not before, where the Conservative Party of Canada and the <span class="companylink">University of Calgary</span> stand on child pornography.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canada I was born into accepted social, racial and linguistic prejudices as normal. It saw certain citizens as more obviously worthy than others, not because of their accomplishments but because of their backgrounds. It was a grey, stultifying, complacent and self-satisfied society. We have now left much of that behind, but at the cost, it seems, of a new kind of conformity, based not on genetics and social stratification but on uncompromising respect for a certain type of liberal discourse. It is a kind of self-censorship that guarantees the hegemony of values now in vogue, as if language itself constitutes social justice and the values in question are immutable, beyond discussion. How much better, in the case at hand, if we had had some facts and duelling expertise before rendering judgment!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As far as we know, when Prof. Flanagan next meets his confessor, he will have but venial, not mortal, sins to confess. And Canada will have less stimulating and less intelligent public debate.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The underrepresentation of natives on Canadian juries is an issue with many dimensions. It emerges clearly from a report by Frank Iacobucci, a former justice of the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>, published last week, that the problem is the result not only of a lack of effort on the part of officials to obtain well-balanced juries but also of a reluctance by many aboriginals to take part in the court system, for which they feel a very understandable mistrust and alienation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Iacobucci's review was commissioned by the attorney-general of Ontario, but essentially the same deficiencies and difficulties are found in other parts of Canada – as also in Australia and New Zealand – where aboriginals constitute a high proportion of the population.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The practice has often been to draw names for juror from municipal property-tax rolls, but residents of reserves are not municipal taxpayers in the first place. Moreover, reserves are often far away from the towns where the courthouses are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the more insidious ways of excluding aboriginals from active participation is the ease with which lawyers – especially prosecutors, if the defendant is a native – can reject potential jurors by a “peremptory challenge,” that is, without any specific objection. Though the word “systemic” can be slippery, Mr. Iacobucci's conclusion that the justice system is systemically biased against natives is reasonable. The report does not offer quick solutions, but rather such measures as the persistent harvesting of names from a variety of government sources, including health-care cards and driver's licences, as well as continuing committees and an assistant deputy attorney-general dedicated to the issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Mr. Iacobucci's more encouraging and interesting findings is that many natives would be quite willing to take part as jurors on coroner's inquests, though they may be reluctant to do so in criminal trials; they prefer to discover and understand causes of deaths and how to prevent them, rather than to draw conclusions that will lead to punishments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials must be assiduous in making sure natives take an active part in juries, and natives should try to overcome their mistrust of the justice system.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're short on time – or like the idea of instant portion control – the convenience of a frozen entrée is appealing. With so many options crowding the frozen-food aisle – organic, vegetarian, reduced fat, low calorie, made with whole grains – it's easy to find a meal that's good for you. Right?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not really. It can be challenging to find a meal you actually like, satisfies your appetite, is easy on sodium and contains more than a smattering of vegetables. To determine if a frozen entrée is as healthy as its name – or picture on the box – implies, you need to scan the nutrition facts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make a healthier selection, choose a frozen meal with no more than three grams of saturated fat and 500 milligrams of sodium (a tough task since most companies don't skimp in the salt department). Check for fibre (at least four grams) and protein – both can help you feel satisfied. Round out a frozen meal by adding vegetables and fruit with yogurt for dessert. A low-calorie meal won't satisfy the appetite of an active person. Even people trying to losing weight need 400 to 500 calories per meal.</p>

And with only 11 grams of protein (about an ounce of chicken) per 255-gram meal, you're bound to move on to after-dinner snacks.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Phil Kessel keeps up this type of home-ice production, he'll soon catch Frazer McLaren. Maybe as early as Wednesday, when the <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span> hit the halfway mark of the abbreviated, 48-game regular season with a contest against the <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span> at the Air Canada Centre.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In what has to be a good sign for a team that plays eight of its next 12 games at home, the Leafs used a furious third-period rally Monday night for a 4-2 win over the <span class="companylink">New Jersey Devils</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Held to just 10 shots through two periods, the Leafs jumped on the Devils for the tying goal just 39 seconds into the third period, then buried the visitors with goals from Clarke MacArthur and (wait for it) Kessel, who scored his first home-ice goal of the season at 9:52 of the period, finishing off a 2-on-1 with James van Riemsdyk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until then, the narrative was easy enough: Head coach Randy Carlyle's faith in his fourth line, so often rewarded this season, was about to do him in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nazem Kadri, meanwhile, was continuing to prove that he might be something more than the flavour of the month, the flip-side being that as he and linemates Leo Komarov and MacArthur showed an ability to leave their imprimatur on a game, the Leafs' so-called first line of Kessel, van Riemsdyk and Tyler Bozak was once again posting a no-show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One goal does not a turnaround make, but considering how tightly the Devils played in their own end on Monday, there was plenty to put Carlyle's mind at rest in the third. Jay McClement, a useful addition this season, jumped on an ill-conceived attempted cross-ice pass by Patrik Elias to beat Johan Hedberg and tie the score before Kadri showed good patience in finding MacArthur in front of the goal on the power play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wins and the goals have been at a premium on home ice for the Leafs, and they looked done for when Marek Zidlicky took advantage of the Leafs' fourth line for a pair of goals, hooking up on both occasions with Ryan Carter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His third goal of 2013 came at 11:18 of the second period, when Zidlicky took advantage of a turnover just inside the Devils end and, with Colton Orr and McLaren hemmed in the offensive zone, one-timed Carter's return pass on a 2-on-1 break.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was little Leafs goalie James Reimer could do then – or five minutes earlier, when Carter won the draw against David Steckel and Zidlicky wheeled in from the left wing to flick a wrist shot past Reimer with Orr and McLaren caught flat-footed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reimer was outstanding, stopping 21 shots and sprawling to rob Elias just after MacArthur had given the Leafs their 3-2 lead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kadri's ninth goal, at 10:34 of the first period, opened the scoring and it was a fluke, albeit the product of his own diligence. He peeled away toward the net and tried to slide MacArthur's pass to Komarov, only to have the puck hit the blade of Hedberg and trickle under his legs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kadri had a hat trick in the previous game, and that led Devils head coach Pete DeBoer – who coached Kadri for two seasons with the OHL's Kitchener Rangers – to tell the Toronto Sun his former charge played with the same edge as (wait for it) Doug Gilmour. Tabloid gold!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kessel, Bozak and van Riemsdyk have a grand total of six goals through 10 home games, four of them by van Riemsdyk. Matt Frattin has as many goals at the ACC as van Riemsdyk, despite the fact that four of the 10 games he's missed with injury have been home games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McLaren, who is here for his fists, has two goals at the ACC. Yikes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The optimists will say the return of Frattin and Joffrey Lupul will restore some order and depth to the forward positions, and they are correct, but if Bozak and Kessel, in particular, continue to waste more minutes of ice time than any other first-line forwards in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>, it will not matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the Leafs' credit, they have few passengers on most nights under Carlyle. Unfortunately, when they do, it's the first-class passengers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the latest proposal for NHL realignment is shot down again by the players, the deal-breaker will be the playoff format.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That's the big thing, the evenness in making the playoffs,” <span class="companylink">New Jersey Devils</span> goaltender Johan Hedberg said Monday. Hedberg, though, doesn't like the word deal-breaker, adding he expects there will be more “tweaking” of the format before the NHL Players' Association is asked to approve it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just when that approval is expected is not clear, nor is it clear if all 740 players will vote on the matter or if it will be left up to the 30 player representatives from each team. A conference call for the player reps is planned for this week by the NHLPA and the approach will be decided then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'd like to hear some more arguments, for my personal view,” <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span> player rep Dave Steckel said of the proposed playoff format.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, there is still a good chance this proposal – or one similar to it – will fly because this time around, the NHL developed it through discussions with the NHLPA. The union was not consulted for a realignment proposal last season, which was ultimately rejected by the players.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I know the NHL worked with the union a little more on this one, which is fair because the players are the ones logging the air miles,” said Maple Leafs defenceman John-Michael Liles, who spent the first seven seasons of his career in the Western Conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the new proposal, which was unveiled last week, the NHL will go from two conferences of 15 teams and three divisions each to two conferences with two divisions each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Eastern Conference divisions will have eight teams each, while the Western Conference divisions will have seven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(The difference was created by granting the wishes of the <span class="companylink">Detroit Red Wings</span> and <span class="companylink">Columbus Blue Jackets</span> to move to divisions with Eastern time zones, while the <span class="companylink">Winnipeg Jets</span> will move to the West from the East.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eight teams in each conference will make the playoffs for a total of 16 – the same as the current format. But only the top three finishers in each division are assured a spot in the postseason. They will be seeded Nos. 1 through 3 and open the playoffs within their division. The two No. 4 seeds will be wild-card teams that finish next in points to the other six playoff teams. The wild-cards can cross over to another division for the playoffs, depending on their records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wild-card approach was an attempt by the NHL to make the playoff setup as fair as possible. Under the current system, the first-place finishers in each division are seeded Nos. 1 through 3 in the conference-based playoffs, even if there are other teams with more points – which often results in complaints as the third seed can be a weaker team than its first-round opponent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the latest proposal still cannot get around the fact it will still be easier for Western teams to make the playoffs because they will have one less team in their proposed divisions than their Eastern counterparts. It was this concern, plus a feeling the travel inequities between Eastern and Western teams were not fully addressed, that resulted in the players rejecting a similar realignment proposal last season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The travel problem is eased somewhat in the newest proposal, as teams are once again grouped by time zone. But the cross-over potential for the playoffs means there will be travel difficulties in the Western Conference if a team in the Central time zone (like the Jets) has to play a Pacific time-zone opponent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the players appear willing to put up with travel inequities as long as a wild-card system gives more teams at shot at the playoffs. And for good reason, Steckel says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“From a player standpoint, some [new] contracts are earned in the playoffs,” he said. “A lot of guys would rather be in the playoffs working for their next contract,” rather than seeing one or two less regular-season road trips.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It didn't make the headlines – when to introduce bodychecking took care of that – but there is more to the survey released this week by the Rick Hansen Institute than when 12-year-old hockey players should be allowed to hit each other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the online questions put to the 2,017 Canadian adults by pollster Angus Reid asked about the size of the ice surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If,” the question went, “it meant reducing the rate of traumatic head, neck or back injuries, would you support widening the ice surface for hockey?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 1,013 who made up the “All Canadians” sample – accurate to plus or minus 3.1 per cent – only 7 per cent were against tampering with the traditional North American (and NHL) ice surface of 200 feet by 85 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, 41 per cent were keen on moving to the Olympic/international ice surface (15 feet wider), while 13 per cent favoured widening by 10 feet, and another 13 per cent would like to see the ice five feet wider. That's two out of three Canadians in favour of bigger ice. (Roughly one quarter, 27 per cent, weren't sure.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate sample group of 502 hockey parents, 46 per cent wanted Olympic ice, 16 per cent the 10-foot expansion, and 12 per cent went for five more feet. That's three-quarters of hockey parents in favour of bigger ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sample of self-identified hockey fans were the same: three out of four in favour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, obviously, size matters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have known for a decade that there are fewer collisions on the Olympic ice than on the NHL ice. In 2004, Toronto Western Hospital neurologist Dr. Richard Wennberg published a study that analyzed video from two recent Stanley Cup finals and compared them to play at the world junior championship and Olympics on the larger ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average NHL playoff game had 264 hits; the average international game 170. The intensity of a Stanley Cup final accounts for some discrepancy, but international playoff hockey can be intense as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is undeniably a difference, as confirmed a year ago by Alexei Kovalev, who returned to Moscow to play following 18 seasons in the NHL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is more space and more room for players that can be hurt [to] get away and skate away from getting injured,” Kovalev told the CBC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Players today are much bigger, faster and stronger than they were even a generation ago,” says Bill Barrable, chief executive officer of the Rick Hansen Institute, “and the risk has increased with this trend.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current rash of injuries, including concussions, in the NHL has a great many wondering about what can be done to better protect the players. Some are blaming the shortened season – little time between games, players not in midseason shape, the desperation brought on by accelerated playoff drives – but this does not explain away the previous seasons when injuries, especially those to the head, were a constant topic of conversation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“None of this is going away until we make the ice bigger,” Detroit Red Wings coach Mike Babcock said the other day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one – certainly not Babcock – expects this to happen. The NHL had its opportunity in the 1990s, when dozens of rinks were either built or refurbished, and elected not to go to the larger ice surface. Traditionalists wanted no change; owners wanted to keep as many premium-priced seats as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditionalists are as silly as owners are greedy. The NHL regulation size pretty much mirrors the Montreal rink where the first organized game was played in 1875. Up until recent years, uniformity was not demanded, as anyone who was ever in the old Boston Garden will know</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Olympic tradition, it's worth noting that the first Olympic hockey competition, held in Antwerp in 1920, took place on a rink measuring barely 165 feet by 581/2 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where it might make good sense to expand the rink size – or, conversely, lower the number of skaters per side to four – is in responsibility for injuries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Rick Hansen Institute questionnaire dared ask if those “minor hockey associations which do not eliminate bodychecking should be held liable for health care and other related costs?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among all Canadians, 66 per cent said they should, while only 23 per cent thought the associations should not be held liable. “Not sure” accounted for 11 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The highest support was found in Quebec, which has banned bodychecking at the peewee level and below. There, 79 per cent were in agreement. Lowest support was found in Alberta (45 per cent), where bodychecking at the peewee level (11 and 12) has been a hot topic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who counted themselves hockey fans also agreed that associations should be responsible, with 60 per cent saying they should be liable, 32 per cent against it and 8 per cent not sure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hockey parents were split: 47 per cent in agreement, 46 per cent against, 8 per cent not sure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What everyone is sure of is that this debate will not go away. Professional football is already reeling from various class-action lawsuits launched by former players who feel they deserved better protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And hockey is not a law-free zone, despite so much evidence that suggests it is.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is there a better way to manage Toronto's more than 1,600 parks? Can we get communities more involved? Can we change the bureaucratic, top-down model in which an underfunded parks department merely struggles to keep the parks in a half-decent state?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dave Harvey, director of Toronto Park People, has been working hard on these questions. Now he has some big money to back him up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">W. Garfield Weston Foundation</span> is putting up $5-million over three years to “support transformational projects that enhance Toronto's green spaces and build innovative partnership models.” At a city hall committee meeting on Monday, Mr. Harvey said that, “in my opinion, it's a game changer in Toronto.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says the donors aren't just interested in paying for a few new splash pads. They want to work with his group to make parks work better. The grants, which will support projects ranging from $25,000 to $750,000, could go to new food or flower gardens. They could support a creative new park design that goes beyond green grass and park benches. Or they could help build new partnerships to fund and manage parks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There really is a new energy in the city for community involvement, for a new way of trying to do parks,” says Mr. Harvey, whose group, formed in 2011, held its third annual parks summit on the weekend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It all sounds highly promising. “Any time $5-million potentially is going to be invested in parks, that's a good thing,” Toronto Parks general manager Jim Hart told the committee. “Five million can never be a bad thing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But according to at least one city councillor, it just might be. Gord Perks says he worries that injecting private money into the parks could lead to a two-tier system, one for the rich and one for the poor. While he makes clear he sees no “malicious intent” in the grant and is only trying to raise a flag of caution, he says he is worried that city staff weren't consulted about the grant and concerned about what might happen if the donor's view of how to manage or transform a park clashes with the view of the community or the parks department. “What I don't want,” he says, is to have “any group of people, because they have means, jump the queue and get control. Every voice in Toronto has to have equal access to decision making.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What concerns him further is that, three times in his presentation, Mr. Harvey used the word “conservancy.” Park conservancies typically bring in private-sector or community partners to help manage and maintain parks. New York's Central Park has a conservancy. Mississauga and Winnipeg have them, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Perks isn't keen on them. He says they take control from the public at large and that – “granted, only from my searching of the Internet” – he knows of examples where parks have been gated and “only certain people have keys.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These fears seem overdone. Under questioning from city councillors on Monday, Mr. Harvey said he doesn't want to usurp the parks department. “The idea is not to replace what the city is doing, it's augmenting it.” If the foundation funds a project for a particular park, “nothing is going to happen in that park without approval from the city.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if more partners are brought in, “public spaces would remain public spaces.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the worry about a two-tier parks system, he acknowledges that most of the people who get involved in fixing up their local parks are in affluent downtown neighbourhoods, but his organization is working hard to reach out to poorer communities. Its goal is to have “friends-of” parks support groups in all 44 wards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Far from being a possible problem, the $5-million from the Weston foundation has the potential to modernize and generally shake up the complacent way that Toronto's precious parks are run. That can only be a good thing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't often you hear a provincial premier deliver the kind of pleading, remorseful apology that Premier Christy Clark offered on Monday. And while it sounded genuine, it was embedded with the tacit acknowledgment that she had done a poor job of handling the crisis that prompted it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A day after meeting with her cabinet in an emergency session called to deal with the consequences of a leaked memo that revealed plans behind a crass government strategy to cultivate ethnic votes, the Premier was in the legislature for the first time since the scandal erupted. It was a day likely as painful and uncomfortable as she imagined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She had to admit to her caucus that she had done a poor job of first responding to the scandal last week. She had to get up in the legislature and announce that her minister of multiculturalism, John Yap, was stepping aside pending an investigation into the genesis and scope of the ethnic-vote scheme. She had to spend the entire 30 minutes of Question Period taking questions about the affair from the NDP Opposition, time she spent apologizing repeatedly for what happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then she had to meet with the media and respond to queries about her leadership, specifically whether she planned to step down amid widespread criticism in Liberal ranks over the memo and her managing of the fallout from it. So far, she said, the answer is no – at least until the results of the review are in. Then, who knows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What was clear, however, was this was a different Christy Clark than we are used to seeing. Her trademark brass and cockiness were gone. This was a Premier who knows her leadership has suffered a serious blow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Monday, Liberal cabinet ministers and backbenchers were saying privately that for Ms. Clark to remain as Liberal head, she had to own this debacle completely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She had to confess that she had originally underestimated the seriousness of the matter and concede it was a mistake to have a cabinet minister read an apology into the record last week instead of cancelling appointments in Vancouver to return to the legislature to do it herself. She needed to do all these things in order to avoid an ugly mutiny among her ranks just six weeks out from the start of an election campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She did and so saved her job – for now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the scene in the legislature said it all about the carnage this issue has caused for the governing party, which was already trailing badly in the polls before it blew up. The entire Liberal caucus sat silently as Ms. Clark answered question after question. A few bowed their heads for extended periods of time. It was as if they knew there is little that can be done now to turn the Liberal ship of misfortune around. This latest scandal has likely cost the party tens of thousands of votes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reality is that for all the bold talk over phone lines and in hotel bars among Liberal backbenchers who want to see the Premier resign, it's not likely to happen. There is not enough time to put someone new into the job. The public would look dimly upon any talk of pushing the May 14 election date back to accommodate a leadership change. While no one is happy about where things stand, Liberals I spoke to on Monday said Ms. Clark did what she needed to do on this issue – show leadership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one in the government ranks seems to be overly worried about the investigation into the scandal being carried out by deputy premier John Dyble. While Mr. Dyble is head of what is supposed to be an independent civil service, he reports to Ms. Clark. So he is effectively investigating his boss – a problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ethnic-vote plan involves using government for political purposes. But Mr. Dyble has no authority over the Liberal Party, no powers to subpoena e-mails to see what traffic there might have been between the Premier's office and party headquarters. It's also apparent that staff in the Premier's office was using private e-mail accounts to carry on conversations about this plan. He has no power to access those either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Dyble is a respected civil servant with an impeccable reputation, he should not be leading this probe. It should have been handed to a special prosecutor or someone with powers of subpoena. There is little chance that with the limited tools of investigation he has at his disposal Mr. Dyble will find much. Perhaps that is why Mr. Clark didn't seem to be sweating the outcome too much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, she did sound like someone who finally understood how politically ruinous this entire affair has been. Damage that no amount of apologizing can completely reverse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday, March 06, 2013</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Tuesday column about Premier Christy Clark incorrectly described John Dyble as deputy premier. He is deputy minister to the Premier.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's accidental, mind you. In introducing higher costs for overdraft protection, some banks are also schooling their clients on why it's bad to spend more than you have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confession: Even personal finance columnists use overdraft from time to time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a great source of comfort to know that my wife and I will never be caught short as money flies in and out of our joint chequing account on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's a difference between needing overdraft to cover infrequent minor glitches and using it to offset serial overspending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's this latter group that some banks are penalizing with their pricing of overdraft protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're not talking here about interest rates, which are already well into double digits for overdraft balances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where banks are raising the cost of over-spending is in the fees they charge when your account goes into the red.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting April 1, <span class="companylink">Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</span> will offer clients a choice of paying a fixed $4 per month for overdraft protection or a $5 fee every business day an overdraft is created or increased. Currently, CIBC charges a flat $5 per month if you have one or more overdrafts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span> and <span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion Bank</span> already offer clients the choice of paying as they go for overdraft protection, or committing to a fixed fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The practices at these banks show something interesting: At a time of convergence in banks fees and account packages, overdraft is a real differentiator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You may not care much about overdraft protection if you're disciplined enough to always have a positive balance in your account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're not, and I'm in that group, then overdraft is essential. It covers you if your cheques, online bill payments and automatic deposits and debits don't always line up in a way that keeps you in positive balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overdraft can help you avoid the embarrassment of having a debit transaction declined, or a cheque bounce, and help you avoid any charges from the utility or other party you're trying to pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NSF cheques (stands for non-sufficient funds) may also hurt your credit rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A credit guide from the federal <span class="companylink">Financial Consumer Agency of Canada</span> says bad cheques can stay on your record for six years (read it online at bit.ly/WpDYTf).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Infrequent overdrafts in your account are no big deal. Repeated overdrafts are a problem that can't necessarily be solved by paying your bank $4 per month. If that sounds like a good value, then you need to look at whether you're chronically spending more than you should.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of overdraft depends a lot on what bank you deal with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The online bank <span class="companylink">ING</span> Direct allows you to be overdrawn by as much as $250 in its Thrive chequing accounts at no cost. <span class="companylink">ING</span>'s so-called Whoops Protection gives you 30 days to bring your balance back above zero – after that, you pay a $2.50 fee for every 30 days your account is overdrawn (higher overdrafts aren't allowed, <span class="companylink">ING</span> says).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other banks typically charge a flat $5 or so if you go into overdraft at any point during the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $5 fee is charged once during the month, even if you go into overdraft multiple times. RBC, TD and (shortly) CIBC have upped the ante on fees for serial overdrafters by requiring them to either commit to $4 per month or risk getting dinged for $5 multiple times during a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Something all banks have in common is that they make good money on overdraft, even without fees considered. Overdrawn balances are charged interest at a rate of 19 to 21 per cent on an annualized basis, which is in credit card territory. Expect to pay interest on top of any fees you're charged for overdraft protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of Montreal</span> and RBC are examples of banks where overdraft protection may be included in your chequing account package.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, your bank may do you the courtesy of transferring money from another account into your chequing account to cover a shortfall. But given how overdraft pricing is changing, it's a good time to see what you have and how much it costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CIBC said clients who use overdraft often can expect a phone call to point out the benefits of paying $4 per month instead of on a pay-as-you go basis. If you get one of those calls, consider it a lesson in the cost of overspending.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The word “silos” has become an often-used pejorative in the past two decades or so. The latest mishap of Premier Christy Clark of British Columbia, in an ill-conceived “multicultural strategic outreach program,” is a reminder that a clear, silo-like division between a government and a political party is desirable and right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kim Haakstad, Ms. Clark's deputy chief of staff for operations, who has now resigned, oversaw and sent out a foolish, ethnic-politics strategy. (So far, no claim to authorship has been asserted.) It repeatedly advocates a “breakdown” of government silos in order to harvest information – such as contact databases – for the benefit of the Liberal Party of B.C.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Haakstad is said to have been Ms. Clark's closest political confidant; her mistakes reflect on the Premier's own judgment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the inadvertently comical aspects of the memo is that it begins by saying that some ethnic communities feel “ignored between elections.” Its timing of its coming to the attention of the public – two months before the May election – makes it an implicit admission that the Liberals themselves had not paid enough attention to multicultural communities. Quite properly, the memo expresses worries about any appearance of “time-limited pandering.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That impression is fortified by the document's frequent use of the phrase “quick wins,” which suggests easy, short-term prospects of pleasing various ethnic communities. It does not help that these passages often go on to refer to historical wrongs, a term sometimes placed in quotation marks, as if to cast doubt on the seriousness of a community's past sufferings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The extent to which public money and resources were spent on this strategy may not have been great in its unlamented year-long life, but the damage to the governance of the province, if the memorandum had not come to light, could have been very grave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is nothing wrong with political parties seeking support in a whole range of communities. Indeed, major parties should be based on a broad coalition of interests. Notably, the federal Conservatives have matured and become more moderate, in part thanks to their cultivation of multicultural communities, whom their predecessor parties had sometimes neglected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the use of the civil service for such partisan purposes, if encouraged or permitted, would be corrupting.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of all the hot potatoes in Canadian health care, user fees are the hottest. That any patient should pay a fee to see a doctor or enter a hospital has long been anathema to Canadians.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Janice MacKinnon, a former finance minister in Saskatchewan, has picked up that hot potato. She argues in a recent paper for the Macdonald-Laurier Institute that user fees, properly designed, should help finance health care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. MacKinnon is right about design. If user fees – co-payments, as they're called around the world – are implemented, they should be part of the income tax act. Each time a patient used a doctor or a hospital, it would be charged as income and taxed accordingly. Low-income persons would pay little or nothing; the better-off much more, up to a certain limit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec's former Liberal government tried a version of this scheme in 2010, and it hit the proverbial fan. A tax on the sick, said some. Regressive, cried others. Against social solidarity, shouted almost everyone. The finance minister retreated, allowing that Quebec's “political culture” was not ready for such a change. He could have been referring to the whole country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is asserted, with some justice, that user fees might deter poorer people from using the health system, or delay their use of it until their ailments get serious, at which point they cost more to treat. Yes, very poor people would pay nothing, but what about the near-poor? Some of them might be deterred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cost savings? Once various categories of people are exempted from paying (disabled, children, seniors, those with chronic conditions) and a ceiling is placed on yearly payments, the amount raised by the state is actually quite small compared to overall health-care spending. User fees should not be thought of as a way of injecting large amounts into the system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps, however, such fees would deter frivolous use of the system. This is often asserted, though never proven. Yes, we all know or have heard of people who we think use the system excessively. But ask yourself: How many people get up in the morning and think that a good use of their time is to wait to see the doctor or hang out in an emergency ward? Frivolous use exists, but its incidence is easily exaggerated through the repetition of anecdote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this being said, Ms. MacKinnon does have the weight of international practice on her side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, the <span class="companylink">Commonwealth Fund</span> published a straightforward, descriptive survey of health-care systems in 15 countries, including Canada. If we remove the United States (with its very different system), Italy (seldom used for comparative purposes in public administration) and tiny Iceland, we are left with Canada and eight European countries, plus Australia, New Zealand and Japan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of these 12 countries, only three – Canada, Denmark and Britain – do not employ co-payments (in the form of either user fees or insurance deductibles) for seeing doctors or visiting hospitals. In one form or another, all the others ask the patient to pay to use the system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Sweden and Norway, for example, people pay to see a family physician or specialist or to enter a hospital. The payment to see a doctor is $20 to $30; the fee for a hospital stay is more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These countries limit or eliminate payments for children, the poor, the disabled, the elderly and those with chronic conditions. And they impose an annual limit on what patients pay, usually in the range of $250 to $300.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In France, all citizens co-pay for health services, usually in the range of 20 to 30 per cent. But some of that gap is filled by private insurance, which covers about 95 per cent of the population. There are non-reimbursable co-payments for hospital stays and visits to doctors, but these are quite low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In countries such as Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands, there are mandatory private social insurance plans that operate within the public system, and all employ deductibles – a payment to use basic doctor and hospital services. New Zealand has co-payments for seeing a doctor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are good reasons to question user fees linking payments to use. But the majority of countries with public health systems reject these reasons.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Reimer is making the most of a second chance to prove he is the <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span> goaltender of the present and future – because of his coach's obsession with not giving anyone a second chance.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ben Scrivens is also getting his first chance to show he can be a big part of that goaltending picture because of that Randy-Carlyle-no-second-chance thing. And all of us media wisenheimers who whinged all summer that first Brian Burke and then David Nonis should make that Roberto Luongo trade already can go soak our heads. (But both Reimer and Scrivens are too polite to say so.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second chances, when it comes to the Maple Leafs head coach, means building a defensive system that seeks to eliminate them for opposing players.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, keep them away from the front and sides of the net where they can get their sticks on rebounds and loose pucks. Second, make sure you block as many shots as you can so there are no rebounds and when the inevitable few pop loose, clear them as quickly as possible. Other than that, let the opposition feel free to blast away from the perimeter, where Reimer and Scrivens will get all the time they need to see the shot and stop it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since he replaced Ron Wilson as head coach 368 days ago, Carlyle has been pounding that message into his defencemen. It was not one easily absorbed by a group accustomed to Wilson's laissez-faire approach to team defence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Carlyle is not one to give up easily. He won a Stanley Cup with the <span class="companylink">Anaheim Ducks</span> in 2007 with the same approach and was going to do it in Toronto as well, even if a lot of people wondered if the Maple Leafs had the right kind of players to do it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be better to trade for an established goaltender like Luongo, the media sages (including yours truly) advised, let him make the big saves and give those young defencemen some confidence. In the meantime, either Reimer or Scrivens could learn his trade as the backup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, Carlyle sat down with his counterpart with the Toronto Marlies farm team, Dallas Eakins, and made sure they were teaching the same style. He believes in rewarding the players who play best, not the ones who negotiate the best contracts, and “we felt it was important to have that seamless transition to the NHL from the AHL” for those who earn jobs with the big club.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three of them did wind up with the Leafs – Mark Fraser, Mike Kostka and Korbinian Holzer (who signed a two-year contract extension Tuesday) – and all have a hand in the resurgence of the Leafs goaltending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last season, in which Reimer's promise from the season before was undone by a concussion and a neck injury, the Leafs finished 29th out of the NHL's 30 teams in save percentage at .898. Now, with Scrivens providing able support to Reimer, who is back after missing 18 days with a knee injury, the tandem goes into Wednesday's game against the <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span> tied for fourth at .921.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Any time you see a good goalie, you see a good team playing in front of him,” Scrivens said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Reimer and Scrivens say they never let the fascination of the fans and media with a potential Luongo trade bother them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It doesn't really matter what's said by the fans or the media, even my parents,” Scrivens said. “I still know what I can do on the ice.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(He did hasten to add his parents were not among those calling the radio shows demanding the Leafs get Luongo.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Carlyle hinted he might not have balked at a Luongo trade if Burke and Nonis had decided the <span class="companylink">Vancouver Canucks</span> were asking too much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Did we want a higher-level goalie? Well, I want the best players,” the coach said. “If it so happens you can get the best goalie in the league, I'll take the best goalie in the league, you're darn right.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That being said, Carlyle is happy with Reimer and Scrivens as long as they mesh well with the defence. And that lesson will continue, Carlyle noted, bringing up the Leafs' 3-2 loss the last time they played the Sens (Feb. 23).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We know what they did to us the last time, scored a goal with 24 seconds left to win the hockey game,” Carlyle said. “All three of their goals were basically off some form of faceoff or drive to the net and second chance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have to play to a higher level when we play the hockey club from Ottawa.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Ferreira is watching Burnaby enter its most ambitious growth spurt yet.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ferreira, who attended broadcasting school in Burnaby in 1986, recalls that year as the turning point for Burnaby as the Expo Line opened and spurred a development craze. Condos and shopping centres sprouted up near the busy Metrotown rapid transit station through the 1990s. The Millennium Line opened in 2002, giving Burnaby a further boost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A real estate expert who co-owns Urban Analytics Inc., Mr. Ferreira said Burnaby has been a trail blazer for transit-oriented development in Metro Vancouver. Students who take public transit still have to catch a bus to get to the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT), but bus connections from SkyTrain stations have generally improved over the past couple of decades, fuelling growth across Burnaby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Burnaby is an attractive market because of its central location in the Lower Mainland, with two SkyTrain routes going through it,” said Mr. Ferreira, who worked as a radio disc jockey after graduating from BCIT's broadcasting program in 1987. He remembers the popular album back in his final semester at BCIT was U2's The Joshua Tree, but he later decided that life as a DJ wasn't his calling. He returned to BCIT to take the real estate management program from 1990 to 1992, giving him the foundation for his career as a housing analyst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Metrotown neighbourhood, developers Anthem Properties and Beedie Living are starting construction on the first of five condo high-rises in their Station Square mixed-use project. Located next to the Metropolis at Metrotown mall, Station Square attracted solid interest during last fall's tepid real estate market. The first tower, with 269 units in 35 storeys, sold out in October. Construction is slated for completion by late 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Station Square, which offers service in English, Mandarin and Cantonese, estimates the vast majority of its condo buyers are currently living in Burnaby, Vancouver or Richmond. Crystal Mall, the largest Asian-themed shopping centre in Western Canada, is across the street from Station Square. Four more Station Square high-rises, with a total of 1,531 units, are planned within eight years. Retail and office complexes are also envisaged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An older district near Burrard Inlet, Burnaby Heights, has its share of fans who are fond of a stretch of shops on East Hastings Street, from Boundary Road to Gamma Avenue. Popular merchants include the Valley Bakery, Chez Meme Baguette Bistro, Anton's Pasta Bar and the Pear Tree restaurant. But most of the newcomers moving to Burnaby have been flocking to residential projects around rapid transit stations, including Metrotown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The population within 800 metres of the Metrotown station grew from 12,663 in 1991 to 19,770 in 2006, or a 56-per-cent jump, according to data compiled by Metro Vancouver. The 2011 census showed 25,321 people living in the Metrotown area, or 11 per cent of Burnaby's population. “From a housing affordability perspective, Burnaby gives buyers more value than Vancouver,” Mr. Ferreira said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob Ransford, an urban development consultant, said the two SkyTrain routes that run through Burnaby have a ripple effect. “The stations are hubs for buses. There is a diverse network of transit connections. Not everyone goes to downtown Vancouver to go to work,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burnaby has a wide range of employers, including BCIT, Simon Fraser University, <span class="companylink">Telus Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Electronic Arts Inc</span>. “There are a lot of jobs in Burnaby in different areas,” Mr. Ransford said. “Burnaby has done a great job developing density around the SkyTrains stations, more so than what Vancouver has done.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burnaby is focusing development in four “town centres” linked by SkyTrain service – Brentwood, Metrotown, Lougheed and Edmonds. “One thing that the City of Burnaby did well was rezone land around transit stations,” said Michael Geller, an urban planning consultant. Near the Brentwood SkyTrain station, five kilometres north of Metrotown, developer Shape Properties has big retail plans to expand the <span class="companylink">Brentwood Town Centre</span> shopping mall, as well as add a series of condo and office towers in an ambitious proposal that will span more than two decades. “Burnaby doesn't have a traditional downtown centre, like in Langley or Maple Ridge or Chilliwack,” Mr. Geller said. “Burnaby has a collection of shopping districts and business parks.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In today's condo craze, it's easy to forget that new projects must be spread over the long term to avoid a housing glut. “Developers have to be careful about monitoring what condos are on the market today and what's coming up,” Mr. Ferreira said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a saying that people who live beyond their means have Champagne tastes on a beer budget. Clearly the line's author was not thinking of Samuel Adams Utopias, a beer for people on a Champagne budget.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At $114.95 for 710 millilitres, a single bottle will set you back as much as three two-fours of Coors Light. And that's the “bargain” Canadian price. South of the border, the same American-made brew sells for $150 to $180 (U.S.) thanks to that country's unbridled retail markups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even at such nosebleed prices, Utopias is hardly growing stale on retail shelves. Last Friday, 400 bottles sold through the <span class="companylink">Liquor Control Board of Ontario</span>'s phone-order service in two hours and 40 minutes, with a one-bottle-per-customer limit. Expect similar fever when it rolls through British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba in coming weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Champagne luxury, yes. But some drinkers might sooner confuse Coors Light with fine French sparkling wine than they would Utopias. For one thing, Utopias is not carbonated. For another, it sports 29-per-cent alcohol. Let's just say the word refreshing does not leap to mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Complex” and “delectable” certainly would, though. Slightly sweet and syrupy, the caramel-coloured elixir, packaged in a decanter resembling a brew kettle and designed to be served in small pours, unfolds with nuan-ces that include raisin, cocoa, vanilla and spice. To me, it suggests oloroso sherry and tawny port crossed with bourbon and a dollop of maple syrup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I would have guessed port or Cognac,” said Dave Price, a 29-year-old beer enthusiast from Perth, Ont., who travelled more than three hours to Toronto Thursday to take part in a prerelease sampling attended by two dozen other Utopias groupies. “It's really aromatic, heady, boozy.” As part of his $75 tasting fee, Price got the right to purchase a bottle of Utopias ahead of the telephone scramble. He plans to mature it for a few years, next to 30 other cellar-worthy barley wines and Trappist ales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cult brew, first launched in limited quantities 10 years ago, is made by the <span class="companylink">Boston Beer Company</span>, which helped pioneer the craft-brewing movement in North America with Samuel Adams Boston Lager. As with other beers, Utopias starts life as fermented grain and water. That's where the similarity with most of its kin ends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once fermented, it takes a long detour through the land of brown spirits, maturing for years in a variety of oak barrels, in this case ones that previously contained bourbon, port and rum. The blend is assembled like Cognac or Scotch, from multiple casks spanning various years. The current 10th-anniversary edition contains a proportion of beer that had been aging since 1992. “This is one of the few beers in the world that is old enough to drink itself,” says <span class="companylink">Boston Beer</span> founder Jim Koch in a droll reference to the legal drinking age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with flavour like port and a kick like Cognac, is it beer? Absolutely, says Koch, who speaks with an infectious passion for a craft practised by his German-American family for five generations. “Go back to first principles,” he says. “Beer is fermented grain, wine is fermented fruit, and liquor is the distilled product of an earlier fermentation.” Utopias, he notes, is made from grain and not distilled. Ergo, it's a beer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until the Samuel Adams brand came along, beer was widely believed to have a natural alcohol ceiling of about 14 per cent, Koch says. Above that, yeasts choked and fermentation stopped. So, Koch set about isolating yeast strains that could tolerate boozier levels. He also refined a process for slowly administering various types of sugars that could be more easily ingested as the organisms began to tire. “We literally have brewers sleeping in the brewery and feeding yeast like a baby,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that a big beer buzz was the goal, he says. High alcohol is a byproduct of a slow fermentation that's designed to slowly tease out subtleties. Thus extreme brewing was born. It's a term he coined in the early 1990s to describe a pioneering 17.5-per-cent Triple Bock. And with extreme brewing came exorbitant prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The past five years have seen a surge of sticker-shock suds, some unusually strong, some simply unusual. Sink the Bismarck from Scottish company Brewdog, at 41-per-cent, sells for $85 for a 330-millilitre bottle, though it owes its potency to a freezing stage whereby water is artificially removed from the brew. Crown Ambassador Reserve from Australia, aged in French oak and fermented in the bottle like Champagne, costs about $90 for 750 millilitres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It gets more extreme. Tapping the gullibility keg, Carlsberg of Denmark launched Jacobsen Vintage, a barley wine aged in Swedish and French oak priced at $360 for a 375-millilitre bottle. And Sapporo Space Barley relied on grain grown from seeds that spent five months aboard the International Space Station, selling for a relatively down-to-Earth $110 for a six-pack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's only in the last three or four years that I've seen such really high prices on beers,” says Tracy Bethune, a native of Saskatchewan who owns Odonata Beer Company in Sacramento, Calif. Bethune makes a Belgian-style strong beer called Rorie's Ale, which is aged in contact with fresh cherries in used malbec wine barrels. It sells for $20 when available, but Bethune says a San Francisco store has taken to aging and reselling it for $80.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with wine, stratospheric prices are chiefly built on scarcity. Jacobsen Vintage was launched for three years in a row in quantities of about 600 bottles each, while Utopias, at the upper end of extreme-beer volume, this year accounted for slightly less than 15,000 bottles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also helps if the brew is crafted with unique methods that coax out mind-bending flavours, the sort you won't find in brands advertised during the Super Bowl. “Utopias is my way of making a statement that, yes, beer deserves to be put alongside wine and spirits in terms of quality and character and sheer beauty,” Koch says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And alongside Rolex watches and Prada purses.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mind you, it is often hard to tell the difference. “Is Justin Bieber losing it?” screams a rhetorical headline on a blog in The Guardian. There follows a meditation on this: “The fondue, the acoustic album, a washout birthday and now he has kept his fans waiting at the O2 in London. Is it all going wrong for Justin Bieber?” Fondue? Jiminy, that sounds like bad news about our boy Bieber.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Taylor Swift: ‘I'm Not a Clingy, Insane, Desperate Girlfriend'” scream multiple news outlets, picking up Swift's comments in the April issue of Vanity Fair. Fondue doesn't come into it, apparently. However, having to explain that you're definitely not clingy, insane and desperate sure sounds like bad news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In no time at all, one imagines, there will be big-time TV interviews with Oprah in which the two pop stars explain all. And Oprah's magazine will follow up with both fondue recipes and tips about how not to seem a clingy and insane girlfriend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And on the subject of news, the mind (mine, anyway) was mildly boggled by Pastor Mansbridge's simpering, multi-part interview with Canadian Cardinal Marc Ouellet, on CBC's The National, on the matter of the race-for-the-Pope-job. “Obviously you're special …” the Pastor said to the Cardinal, who looked well pleased. If there's a prize for simpering interviews at the Canadian Screen Awards (don't get me started) next year, this one's a shoo-in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In TV-racket news from L.A., it seems that Fox is renewing The Following, The Mindy Project, New Girl and Raising Hope. Good news for sure. The Following has become excellent pulp entertainment, fast-paced and original in its ceaseless twists. Kevin Bacon's been doing masterful turns as the addled agent on the trail of the coolly demonic serial killer Joe Carroll (James Purefoy). The Mindy Project, which I only see occasionally, seems to have found its feet, anchored in a gentle mockery of the clichés of romantic comedy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raising Hope remains adorable, an off-kilter sitcom rooted in dirt-poor working America. New Girl is inconsistent but can be inspired. And its renewal will be welcome news to the makers of black tights for ladies, since Zooey Deschanel doesn't wear anything else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The really big TV news also comes from Fox. It was announced Tuesday that Fox Sports Media Group in the United States will launch a new national network called Fox Sports 1, and it plans to compete head-to-head with ESPN for viewers. This is truly significant. The future of TV, in terms of profit, viewers and marketing, is in sports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new Fox channel, which will replace an existing channel, will offer live Major League Baseball, NASCAR, college football and basketball, soccer from Europe and UFC, among other events. It's an expensive but shrewdly strategic move by Fox.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the TV landscape splinters, and online and DVR viewing eats away at the business model, nothing can compete with live sports events for impact. Sure, people can watch sports online, but there is a natural impulse to watch in groups. Netflix can't offer sports events. Massive fees can be charged to advertisers around live sports because there's less danger viewers will watch later and skip the commercial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some time now, live sports have propped up the networks that have the rights. No matter how many sitcoms and dramas are launched and fail, big-time sports doesn't fail. And sports events are used as a platform to promote those other shows. CBC might not make a ton of money from Hockey Night in Canada, but the broadcast is a platform to promote everything else on CBC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The future of TV is sports. Everything else on TV depends on it. That's the news, good or bad, depending on your view of sports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airing tonight</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeland (Bravo, 10 p.m.) arrives on easily accessible cable at last. If you haven't seen its first two seasons, start now. One of the truly great series of recent years, it's a paranoid spy drama set emphatically in a world where terrorists lurk and doubt about truth is everywhere. Nuanced, smart and with electrifying performances, it's addictive. It opens in Iraq where a <span class="companylink">CIA</span> analyst, Carrie (Claire Danes), is trying to interrogate an Iraqi man who is about to be executed. He claimed to have information useful to the U.S. This is the post-Iraq War, withdrawn-from-Afghanistan world. The certainty of the terrorist threat wobbles; people are moving on. Carrie is then back in the U.S., a pill-popping wreck trying to keep her job. Along comes news that one Sergeant Brody (Damien Lewis), a U.S. sniper captured in Iraq and believed dead, has been found and is being returned to the U.S., a hero. Carrie's got a feeling that Brody might have been turned into a spy, possibly a sleeper terrorist. Nobody wants to know. Carrie's boss (Mandy Patinkin) is very uneasy. Homeland is creepy and absorbing, and it captures the truly tawdry quality of spying.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There will be no surprises this week as China's rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress, holds its annual meeting to “elect” the nation's new leaders. The die was cast at last year's Congress. Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping will be elected president (head of state), while Li Keqiang, second-ranked member of the party's politburo standing committee, will become premier (head of government).</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospect of a younger generation of Chinese leaders more in tune with domestic and international realities could mean a fresh approach for China's relations with the West, with enormous mutual benefit. For Canada, this once-in-a-decade leadership transition could have big implications. A move to rule of law, stable democratic political institutions, openness and transparency would do much to allay Canadian concerns over Chinese investment in Canada, lack of confidence for Canadian investors to enter the Chinese market, and China's poor record regarding the human rights of its citizens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But will it happen?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At his final press conference at the close of last March's Congress, outgoing premier Wen Jiabao pleaded for the implementation of democratic political reform, warning that otherwise, “such historical tragedies as the Cultural Revolution may happen again.” One would hope that his younger successors will make these sentiments a starting point in setting a new agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, this presents a problem for the Communist Party. If China adopted the rule of law and a new transparency that exposed the pervasive corruption of party officials, many of them would end up with convictions and jail time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Communist Party does not want a spotlight on its culture of getting things done with kickbacks, bribes and thuggery, or anyone looking too closely into matters such as the arbitrary arrest of rival independent businessmen, or the “disappearances” and torture of human-rights activists. Not to mention the violent suppression of Tibetans and Uyghurs, which verges into <span class="companylink">International Criminal Court</span> territory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in January, Mr. Xi acknowledged that “some” party members have become “degenerate and corrupt,” although he said in a speech a month earlier that the problem is “Westernization and bourgeois liberalization.” Regardless, Mr. Xi has implored party officials at all levels to revive their commitment to Marxist-Leninist values and not follow the former Soviet Union, whose Communist Party collapsed, he said, because “they denied Lenin, they denied Stalin. Everything was denied. It led to historical nihilism and ideological anarchy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While such a stark call to Stalinism may sound archaic to the West, it appears to be the new leadership's strategy of “circling the wagons” against any challenge from citizens emboldened by the ability of social media to rally support for democratic discourse. In its response, the government looks like the sorcerer's apprentice as it tries to delete sensitive postings on Weibo (China's version of <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>) and block access to Web pages that sprout like cyber mushrooms, jumping from server to server in order to keep one step ahead of China's Internet police.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only answer that Xi and Co. have come up with is to reinforce and strengthen the party's Leninist approach to government by using stricter controls of the Internet to inhibit freedom of expression, by suppressing political dissidence and by increasing state control of all aspects of China's society and economy. But they have been unable to stop increasing numbers of citizens from realizing the complete disconnect between the party's official ideology, the reality of Chinese politics and the social values of Chinese young people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Communist Party leadership is desperate to make Marxism seem relevant to China's contemporary circumstances. The latest national policy, “Project in Theoretical Research and Development of Marxism,” involved a state investment of a billion Chinese yuan. The net result of this massive expenditure was a new political program known as the “Three Confidences,” which states that “the whole party must have firm confidence in this path, have confidence in this theory and have confidence in this system.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To have such a weak, even pathetic outcome after so much money and effort will not inspire anybody with much confidence. That this is the best that the party's intelligentsia can come up with in these circumstances does not bode well for the party's revival during this government's 10-year term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, it appears that Mr. Xi, Brezhnev-like, is presiding over a fin-de-siècle Communist regime, devoid of new ideas and severely constrained by a stifling Leninist system that was emphatically repudiated elsewhere more than 20 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is little that Canada can do but watch and hope that China is not on a path to political and economic meltdown. But, regrettably, it is becoming more and more apparent that the new boss is not just the same as the old boss. Mr. Xi is arguably a weaker and even more ineffectual leader of a fading caretaker regime that has more past than future.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Prep time: 15 minutes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Ready in: 20 minutes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Serves: 8</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garnish:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2 tsp olive oil</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1/2 cup fresh breadcrumbs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3 Belgian endives, shredded</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 head radicchio, shredded (about 6 cups)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">11/4 cups chopped red onion</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 egg, hard-boiled</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vinaigrette:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 tsp Dijon mustard</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4 anchovies, chopped</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 tsp minced garlic</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 tbsp white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1/4 cup olive oil</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Salt and freshly ground pepper</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heat 2 tsp olive oil in a small frying pan over medium heat. Add breadcrumbs and toast, stirring until golden, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and cool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Place endive and radicchio in a medium bowl with onion. Grate egg over the salad. Whisk together mustard, anchovies, garlic, vinegar and 1/4 cup olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Toss salad with vinaigrette, then breadcrumbs. Serve immediately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Savoury Cheese Torta</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This stunning cheese pie is presented like a galette or country pie. You can make this free-form or in a baking dish. Although one is enough for eight people, I found I needed another one for seconds. Vary the cheeses for different tastes and fold in cooked baby spinach, roasted cherry tomatoes or chopped green olives for layers of flavour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Prep time: 1 hour, including chilling pastry</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Ready in: 2 hours</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Serves: 8</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crust:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2 cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1/2 tsp salt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3/4 cup unsalted cold butter, cut into cubes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1/2 cup cold water</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Filling:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 tbsp olive oil</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">16 thin slices pancetta</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2 cups mascarpone</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2 egg yolks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2 eggs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 cup grated provolone</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 cup grated Asiago</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 tbsp Dijon mustard</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2 tbsp chopped parsley</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Salt and freshly ground pepper</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 egg, beaten with 1 tbsp water</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Combine flour, Parmesan cheese and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Add butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Drizzle in enough water so that pastry starts to come together. Dump into a bowl and, using your fingertips, combine gently into a smooth ball. (This prevents overprocessing the pastry). Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preheat oven to 375 F. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry pancetta slices until crisp, about 2 minutes per side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mix together mascarpone, egg yolks and whole eggs in a bowl. Stir in provolone, Asiago, mustard and parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roll out chilled pastry to fit a 9-by-13-inch baking dish or tart pan with a removable bottom, leaving about 2 inches of overhang. Layer fried pancetta on top of crust. Spread egg and cheese mixture over top. Fold overhanging pastry over filling – it will not cover the entire top – and brush with egg wash. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until filling is firm and crust is golden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEPPI'S PICKS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The salad, enticing though it is, will be kind to no wine. Pungent mustard, sharp vinegar, egg, raw onion – that's quite the arsenal. Best to go with a very crisp, light Mediterranean white. The torta combines some of the same ingredients, but it's baked and filled with melted cheese, a wine-friendly profile. Specifically, it will be good with an aromatic white, such as gewurztraminer and pinot gris, especially from Alsace.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hugo Chavez, one of Latin America's most formidable politicians, will be remembered for his enduring political acumen and virile charm. But ultimately, the great caudillo fell short in his goal of establishing an alternative model of development for his country, and for the world. The Bolivarian revolution – named for the independence hero Simon Bolivar – did not succeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fourteen years after he came to office, Mr. Chavez leaves the Caribbean nation of 29 million with less poverty, but also with a weaker democracy, a polarized electorate, a high crime rate and a movement that cannot be sustained without its leader. His socialist policies depended on Venezuela's great oil wealth, and so did his diplomacy. He propped up Cuba with heavily subsidized oil (100,000 barrels a day) and attacked the U.S., even as Venezuela remains heavily dependent on oil exports to that country.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no doubt the 58-year-old leader, with his signature red beret and military fatigues, had an almost messianic hold on supporters. After years of being excluded from the political process, the poor could relate to his informal language and folksy style. Every week on his live television program, Alo Presidente, Mr. Chavez sang, read poems, danced and talked, sometimes for hours. He had 3.2 million followers on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>. “Chavez always loved the limelight. He was always the best talker,” said a former Canadian diplomat who served in Venezuela from 2003 to 2006. “But he also played to Venezuela's deep dictatorial roots.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His mission to spread the country's huge oil wealth more equitably did succeed in decreasing poverty and illiteracy, and in improving health outcomes. However, Mr. Chavez failed to create a political system with a meaningful system of checks and balances. Instead, control was centralized under the president, the state bureaucracy became more corrupt and unaccountable, and the judiciary less independent. The opposition and press were under constant attack. “He eroded the quality of democracy in a country with a long history of democracy,” notes Max Cameron, a Latin American specialist at the <span class="companylink">University of British Columbia</span>. “He bullied opponents and made blacklists for people who opposed him.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His foreign policy was aggressive in its support of some of the world's worst actors. He provoked diplomatic and military tensions with Colombia over his support for FARC terrorists. He insulted president George W. Bush, labelling him the “devil.” At the same time he cultivated friendly relations with the likes of Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi, Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe and Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. His subsidies for Cuba and support for the Castro brothers only delayed inevitable reforms in that country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These anti-democratic tendencies, at home and abroad, were evident early on. He joined the military with the idea of carrying out a coup, which he attempted in 1992, against the government of president Carlos Andres Perez. The coup failed, and he spent two years in a military jail before he was pardoned. He eventually came to power through the ballot box in December, 1998. In 2002, el comandante himself suffered a coup attempt, one that he blamed on the U.S. He returned to office a few days later, and went on to win by a larger margin of victory in the 2006 election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increasing authoritarianism marked his later years in office; in 2006, Mr. Chavez nationalized electricity companies and held a referendum, which changed the Constitution to allow unlimited terms in office for elected officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With his passing, the country enters a period of instability and uncertainty. Many believe there can be no Chavismo without Chavez, and that the factions within the movement will fight for power and self-destruct. His appointed successor, Nicolas Maduro, is favoured by the civilian wing within the movement, and by Cuba, while the President of the National Assembly, Diosdado Cabello, has the support of the military. Opposition leader Henrique Capriles, the Governor of Miranda state, who lost the 2012 presidential election by 11 points, is also a credible challenger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His successor will face steep economic challenges. Though Venezuela has the world's largest proven oil reserves, the sector is beset by inefficiency and the economy is too reliant on oil revenues, which account for 30 per cent of GDP. Oil output at the state-owned <span class="companylink">Petroleos de Venezuela</span> is lower than it was in 1999. There has been no foreign investment in this sector for four years. Inflation is high, and the currency overvalued. “He is leaving a huge mess behind,” said the diplomat. “There is no transparent budget, and last year the government wildly overspent because it was an election year. The deficit and the debt are out of control.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This ultimately is the Chavez legacy. It is a shame that he did not put his political gifts to a better end, and set Venezuela, a country he so loved, on a path to long-term economic growth and development and the strengthening of democratic institutions. Its neighbour, Brazil, has succeeded in doing this, as well as creating a more equitable society. In the end, perhaps that model would have served Mr. Chavez better, instead of the one he chose to follow.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It won't happen, of course, but Hugo Chavez's tombstone should have space on both sides for totally opposing perceptions of his legacy. As usual, the truth encompasses both sides and even “objective” critics, like myself, will argue about the balance.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venezuela is in many ways a shambles, and its president for the past 14 years has been rightly vilified as an incompetent manager. Inflation (at 18 per cent) is the worst in Latin America; <span class="companylink">Transparency International</span> ranks Venezuela 165th on its corruption index. Spending on imports has quadrupled in 10 years; criminal violence is soaring; infrastructure is rusting; and the oil industry, now virtually the only engine of the economy, has been so badly administered that Venezuela imports some refined petroleum products from the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president who sat on what has recently been verified as the largest oil reserves in the world contrived to have the country live beyond its abundant means. The fiscal deficit stands at close to 20 per cent. By contrast, the U.S., with its fiscal cliff, is at 7 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One part of this equation was Mr. Chavez's international philanthropy. The Cuban economy floats on Chavez oil and other subsidies. Most of the cash-strapped and oil-dry Caribbean and Central American countries are indebted to his concessional PetroCaribe program. Major recipients of generous Venezuelan support are Ecuador, Bolivia and Nicaragua. Mr. Chavez has more than filled the holes left by the withdrawal of most Western development assistance to Daniel Ortega's Sandinista government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chavez was proud of his democracy and to his credit, he installed what is probably the most tamper-proof voting system in the Americas. The opposition did not contest his 55-per-cent majority in October's presidential election, nor is there much dispute about the overwhelming success of his party in December's gubernatorial elections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, reliable results on election day do not compensate for the loss of the country's independent judiciary, the politicization of the electoral tribunal, the muzzling of much (not all) of the opposition media, the flagrant abuse of state resources for government candidates – in other words, the tilting of the electoral playing field and the removal of checks and balances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chavez zealots will claim that it was their leader who punctured the image of Uncle Sam's massive clout in the hemisphere. He had a role, certainly, but a smaller one than Brazil and Cuba.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dark side of Mr. Chavez is very dark and stands in puzzling contrast to his successes. Frequently a clown who took adolescent pleasure in America-baiting, he was also a genuine socialist reformer. Illiteracy has all but disappeared in Venezuela. Education and free health care are almost universally available. He has partially closed the huge gap between wealth and poverty. Improving the quality of life for millions at the bottom levels of society is no small achievement. He also imparted to these millions a sense of dignity about themselves and pride in their leader's often bombastic rhetoric.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does Mr. Chavez's good outrank Mr. Chavez's bad? Probably, but taken together, they make a difficult legacy. There is now a major question about whether corroded institutions and a misshapen economy, previously held intact by his extraordinary vitality, can be sustained by Nicolas Maduro, the non-charismatic designated successor. In the short term, it is likely that the transition will succeed and Mr. Maduro will win the next election. For the longer term, as they say in Caracas, Quien sabe? – “Who knows?”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flag of the Confederate States during the American Civil War has been the subject of recent controversy in two places in Ontario. Though it should not be prohibited as hate speech, Canadians should not regard the flag as a harmless cultural symbol. There would have been no such Confederacy and no such emblem if slavery had not existed in the southern United States. What some Southerners euphemistically called the “peculiar institution” was at the very core of the war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Hamilton, a two-location barbecue restaurant called Hillbilly Heaven displays the Confederate flag, giving offence to many in an area that was a leading destination for escaped slaves on the Underground Railroad. And in Sutton, Ont., on Lake Simcoe, the local high school has banned the use of the same flag on its premises; many students had adopted it by association with country and western music.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hillbilly Heaven should be allowed to use the Confederate flag, just as people should be free not to eat there. The school is another matter; a public institution should not condone an expression of racism and human bondage on its grounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The distinction between the South and the North was that in one region slavery was permitted and not in the other. The immediate cause of the secession of the Southern states was the election as president of the Republican candidate, Abraham Lincoln, who opposed the extension of slavery to new states in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apologists for the Confederacy, then and now, have argued that slavery was not the essential issue at stake; it was about states' rights, they say. In truth, Lincoln and the Republicans did not propose to alter the powers of any of the existing states.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was dissed for presuming to take on motherhood and the C-suite simultaneously, then criticized for returning to work two weeks after giving birth. Now she's taking it on the chin for deigning to ask telecommuting employees to return to the office while she figures out how to ensure <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span>'s profitable future?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, her own work-life balance is made easier as a result of an in-office daycare arrangement not available to everyone else. But no one can doubt her work ethic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And my guess is that whatever measures she undertakes to accommodate her own family issues may help pave the way for more widely available child-care solutions for others at <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> – male and female.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although some critics have argued that Ms. Mayer's cancellation of the working-from-home option is punishing “the sisterhood,” studies suggest that more men actually telecommute than women. (I suspect this is at least partly due to the fact that, for many mothers who juggle kids and domestic duties, the office offers the kind of change that's almost as good as a rest.) And anyone who's ever tried to work from home with young children knows that genuine productivity requires some form of daycare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, <span class="companylink">Bell Canada</span>, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and <span class="companylink">Google</span> (Ms. Mayer's previous employer) have all implemented restrictions on telecommuting and, although many of those affected are unhappy, no similar outrage has erupted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most days, my own commute is a yoga-togged shuffle down a short hallway. As a self-employed consultant and social entrepreneur, I've worked from home for most of my 30-year career.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I know that not everyone is cut out for such independence. Dozens of office-bound friends and colleagues have asked me over the years how I manage to avoid being distracted by daytime TV, bed or online poker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's simple: If I don't work, I don't get paid. So the time sheet I keep tracks the work I complete every quarter hour, and whether I can defensibly bill it to a client or project. This discipline is an effective deterrent against aimless surfing or two-hour lunches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one colleague I employ is on salary. But because she meets assigned deadlines and maintains a similarly detailed time sheet, I trust her to split her time between our rented office and her home, as necessary. The arrangement allows her to run her daughter from daycare to the doctor in half an hour, avoid driving in snowstorms, and be home for the cable guy without wasting a vacation day. But we meet in person at least once a week, and Skype almost every day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mayer, as president of a large international high-tech company in an enormously competitive industry driven by creative collaboration, has much more incentive to encourage her team to congregate in the same space at least some of the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if some of them show the ability to more effectively deliver innovation and productivity while also saving office space, I suspect she may be open to that.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sochi, here we come. Not me, but Canada. Mind you, why Sochi is the venue for the Winter Olympics is a bit of a mystery – a subtropical beach resort with palm trees, the Cold War-era summer getaway for Soviet bosses and nobs. Go figure.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyway, it's where the action on the ice will be. And, apart from the hockey, a vast amount of attention will be paid to the figure skating, that most bizarre and intriguing sport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The poet Al Purdy once posed the question, “Out on the ice can all these things be forgotten/ in the swift and skilled delight of speed?” Purdy was writing rhapsodically about hockey, but those two lines of poetry might well apply to the figure-skating racket. I once wrote, “Figure skating is hoser culture with a thin gloss of tacky sophistication.” And got an earful from readers. On this matter, I'm no Al Purdy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet there truly is a strangeness to it all: the judging scandals, Tonya Harding, the ritual of the kiss 'n' cry scene at the end of a performance, the sometimes incomprehensible scoring of the routines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ice, Sweat and Tears (CBC, 9 p.m. on Doc Zone) is a captivating and illuminating look inside elite figure skating and it arrives just before the World Figure Skating Championships, which begin next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're told from the start that it's harder to reach the top in figure skating than it is to get to the top in professional hockey. The top skaters, the doc says, are pushed to the limits of physical and mental endurance. The phrase “ice, sweat and tears” is used a tad too often, but we get it – it's a very demanding sport, even if one of the first vignettes we see is a conversation about lady skater's skirt. There's some fuss about whether she can wear a wee skirt or shorts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are taken inside Skate Canada's high-performance centre where the top skaters and the emerging ones are refining new routines. Patrick Chan is working on his new program. The skaters talk about the risks involved, including concussion, and the enormous demands that they put on their bodies. Kurt Browning concludes, “You don't cross the street without risk. So whaddaya gonna do, stay home?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We also spend a lot of time with Olympic champions Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir. And the most fun segment of the program (made by Michael McNamara) is watching Marina Zueva coach Virtue and Moir at a skating club in Canton, Mich. Zueva is the famous Russian ice-dancing coach and choreographer. She has worked with Virtue and Moir before, and with their great rivals, the American champions Meryl Davis and Charlie White.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zueva knows what she wants, but her English isn't always adequate to communicate it. She is terrifically charming and demanding, and eventually people understand when she says, “It's do, it's fun, see.” Or, “It is true how have to be looked.” Eventually, both Americans and Canadians figure it out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We see Chan and former coach Christy Krall playing cards backstage at the 2012 Canadian Championships. We observe Canadian pairs medalists Paige Lawrence and Rudi Swiegers training in isolation in Virden, Man., and see what happens when Lawrence suffers a concussion and is unsure if she can compete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout, the smallness of the world becomes obvious, and we get some sense of the intense competition that exists between performers who see each other all the time. There are small hints of envy and ego but, at least while the cameras are on, the camaraderie is striking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon, when the World Championships and then the Olympics unfold, we'll see a lot of figures talking about these things on TV. In many ways, figure skating is bizarre television. The skaters tend to be hopelessly self-conscious off the ice and, frankly, they dress badly. On the ice, many seem to model their outfits on what the members of ABBA wore, circa 1973. And yet the sport has enormous appeal as TV entertainment. In Canada, people young and old watch it at home and are transported to a place rarely reached. The allure of it is inside us, as Canadians – the challenge of achieving speed and grace on ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ice, Sweat and Tears doesn't provide all the answers about the allure, but it does give insight into the drive that propels the top competitors forward. Sochi, here they come.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having watched the Liberal government avert a leadership crisis that would have plunged B.C. into chaos, New Democratic Party Leader Adrian Dix knows the spotlight will now once again be trained on him.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the budget now passed and the start of an election just six weeks away, Mr. Dix will be hounded for details of the party's election platform. It will no longer be good enough for the Opposition Leader to criticize the government for its policies; he'll have to say, finally, what the NDP would do differently if it ascends to power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dix faces some miserable decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is well aware that the Liberals are trying to make this election about jobs, the economy and who's best able to manage the treasury. That is why they were so desperate to present a balance budget, even though it was mostly done on the back of Crown assets that they intend to sell. Factoring in revenue from prospective sales is not a kosher accounting practice in many jurisdictions. The $800-million the government says it will get from these properties is a best guess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, the NDP figures there is about $1.2-billion of revenue in the budget that shouldn't be there. In other words, there is $1.2-billion, or thereabouts, that the NDP will not be able to use in the budget it imagines for the current fiscal year. That's the hole from which the party begins. There are other potential revenue challenges on the horizon – like a cut in federal health transfer payments – that make the downstream picture even bleaker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's almost a certainty that when the NDP does unveil its election manifesto, it will include a budget picture for at least two years out, possibly three. And it's just as certain that the first two budgets will include mid-to-small-sized deficits. I believe the hope is that the province's resource-revenue picture would have improved enough by Year 3 that the budget would return to surplus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As difficult as the fiscal state the New Democrats would be inheriting is, it's not nearly as grim as the one bequeathed to the party in 1991 by the outgoing Social Credit government. Back then, the New Democrats discovered that it had been left with a deficit that was $2-billion greater than what the Socreds had let on – on an overall budget of $16-billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, the deficit (or the one the NDP believes it will be taking on) as a percentage of the overall budget for the current fiscal year is much less: that is, $1.2-billion on an overall budget of $44-billion. What this means is that an NDP government wouldn't be fiscally crippled for the first few years in the same way Mike Harcourt's government was back in the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean Mr. Dix isn't conjuring the difficult conversations he is going to have to have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is regularly visited in his legislative office by groups wanting to make their pitch to the man widely expected to be the province's next premier. And many are the kind of organizations that believe an NDP government will sympathize with their demands more than the centre-right Liberals. So they would be associations looking for a Quebec-style daycare program, for instance, and left-wing public-policy outfits that want to see MSP premiums abolished. One group wants him to raise income assistance rates, and another wants him to build 10,000 new social-housing units a year for the next six years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After one particular week of these types of meetings, Mr. Dix tallied up what it would cost the treasury if he acted on all of the requests. The number was between $6-billion and $7-billion. As I say, he has some difficult conversations ahead of him should his party win the May 14 vote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are some pledges Mr. Dix has made that he can't get out of, such as one around child poverty. The New Democrats have feasted on this issue for years. It would be unconscionable for them not to act on it in some meaningful way if they gain power, most likely by raising income-assistance rates. Attacking poverty is not cheap. The NDP also estimates there are five times as many 19-year-olds entering the Community Living B.C. system as there are leaving it. The costs associated with that demographic statistic are also significant, but the NDP is committed to properly funding the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It goes on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dix seems well aware, however, that if the NDP is going to design budgets for the next two years with what is deemed to be reasonable deficits, he is going to have to say no a lot. And to traditional allies that will be looking for a bone or two after years of getting nothing from the Liberals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expect to see an NDP platform in early April. It will reveal just how well Mr. Dix has done with some of those miserable choices.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there's one TV genre in which Canadian content rules are redundant, it's the home renovation category. Canadian shows are so dominant that the U.S. HGTV network would be reduced to running endless House Hunters reruns without its popular northern imports. And that would upset Hillary Clinton; Love It or List It is her favourite program.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty should investigate whether all these taxpayer-supported reno shows have fuelled Canada's lofty house prices. If so, he might have to send the Property Brothers into exile. He and Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney have tried almost everything else to tame Canadians' obsession with buying homes. Now, another mortgage “rate war” threatens to undo their hard work, as “bubble fatigue” sends consumers on a springtime buying spree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices are ultimately a function of income and population growth. After a 15-year run – a marathon by historical standards – prices in Canada are out of whack with both of these fundamentals. The Economist thinks Canadian housing is overvalued by a third relative to income. The Fitch ratings agency pegs the overvaluation at 20 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, Mr. Carney no longer sounds as worried about a housing bubble as he did last year. On Wednesday, he indicated that repeated warnings by him and Mr. Flaherty may be scaring Canadians straight, curbing their appetite for debt. But both men are up against history. When property prices get this frothy, pendulum swings are more likely than soft landings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such is the pickle in which Mr. Flaherty and Mr. Carney (at least until the latter's departure for the Bank of England) find themselves. Their risky experiment in guiding Canada through the recession by stoking housing demand is threatening to come undone. Household debt (largely the result of ever bigger mortgages) remains much higher in Canada than it was in the U.S. just before the 2008 crash. It wouldn't take much to turn a vulnerability into a calamity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even as Mr. Carney predicts a salutary stabilization of household debt levels this year, he knows that only creates other problems. If house-crazy consumers hibernate, where will economic growth come from?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even a mild retrenchment in housing would expose Canada's recent overreliance on consumer debt-fuelled expansion. And it would leave the economy with little to run on, as the only other recent driver of growth hits a soft patch. Investment in the mining sector (including the oil industry) is expected to decline by 2.7 per cent this year, while what the central bank calls “ongoing competitiveness challenges” depresses manufacturing exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of this would be nearly as threatening had it not been for fundamental policy errors made in 2006, when the previously staid <span class="companylink">Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp</span>., the Crown-owned mortgage insurer, underwent an extreme makeover. U.S.-style no-down-payment mortgages, 40-year amortization periods and other supply-side “innovations” were introduced. With low interest rates, the new rules slashed the cost of carrying a mortgage. Any 25-year-old with two pay stubs could enter a bidding war on a condo with all the upgrades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the 2008 U.S. crash, Ottawa ordered CMHC to tighten the mortgage rules somewhat. But, desperate for growth, it continued to encourage house hunters. CMHC bought $125-billion in mortgages from the banks, providing them with liquidity to dole out even more home loans. It was an understandable move, given the crisis. But it did not end there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After that, CMHC dramatically grew its portfolio of so-called high-ratio insurance, covering homebuyers who make a down payment of less than 20 per cent. What's more, it more than doubled – to $238-billion – the amount of insurance that banks have voluntarily purchased to cover their other mortgages. Fears of a bubble are undoubtedly one reason banks have sought the added protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CMHC now has $575-billion worth of mortgage insurance in force, a 67-per-cent increase since 2007. Ottawa further tightened mortgage rules last year. But the fact remains that even a mild economic shock would trigger rising defaults, leaving Mr. Carney's successor to pick up the pieces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's hope it won't come to that. Let's hope that, unlike Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke – who, in mid-2007, predicted that the U.S. housing market would “stabilize” – Mr. Carney won't have to eat his words. And we can all go back to watching Love It or List It without worrying.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article in an upcoming issue of the magazine Inside Policy is getting attention in political circles for its critique of the government's budget process and for the fact it was written by two former Finance Department officials. But MPs on both sides of the aisle have been airing similar complaints for a long time. The article doesn't offer much new insight into Ottawa's desultory and secretive budget planning; what it does do is make it clear that, in spite of the honest desire of many to reform the system, Parliament continues to move in the wrong direction.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The article was written by Scott Clark and Peter DeVries, both of whom had senior roles in the Finance Department under Liberal governments but are seen by most to be non-partisan. But they say, “It is now recognized by most observers of the federal budget process, that the integrity and credibility of the process has been seriously eroded in recent years.” Define “recent years,” please. The erosion of Parliament's “power of the purse” has been going on for 40 years, to the point that the solutions are now rote knowledge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To wit, the House of Commons standing committee on government operations and estimates studied the scrutiny of estimates and supply last year, and rounded up the usual suspects: eliminate or modify the deeming rule, which dates back to 1968 and means that a committee that fails to meet its deadline to report on the budget will have been deemed to do so; release the estimates in a more timely fashion so they better reflect what's in the actual budget; use the same budgetary methods in the estimates and budgets; give MPs adequate time to study realistic numbers; and prevent governments from transferring funds between programs that have been allocated in the same vote. All of these obvious solutions to a serious set of well-identified problems have been known for decades, and many MPs are frustrated by their impotence in budgetary matters, but successive governments of all stripes have ignored the issue and continued to consolidate power in the Prime Minister's Office and the cabinet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Harper government was elected on a promise to make Parliament more accountable, but has moved in the opposite direction, passing omnibus budget bills that announce programs without revealing spending details. Budgets are even more impenetrable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The great frustration for all Canadians is that successive governments continue to ignore the well-known prescriptions for fixing the process. No party can hold its head high when it comes to defending Parliament's power of the purse.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Up close, you can see the bruising around Sheldon Souray's right eye finally starting to fade. There is still a mouse there, plus the remnants of the three stitches needed to close a cut just under his eyebrow.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Souray had a close call in last week's game against the <span class="companylink">Los Angeles Kings</span> – a puck deflecting up and into his face so quickly he couldn't react in time to get out of the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it had been half-an-inch closer, Souray acknowledged: “I could have been Marc Staal.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marc Staal is the <span class="companylink">New York Rangers</span>' defencemen, who was a little less lucky than Souray during Tuesday night's game against the <span class="companylink">Philadelphia Flyers</span>. Staal had a puck deflected by Jakub Voracek carom up and into his eye, sending him sprawling to the ice, writhing in pain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't pretty to watch and it once again raised an age-old issue about the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> and player safety. Why wasn't eye protection mandated eons ago? There is a steady list of players, from one era to the next – Henry Boucha to Bryan Berard to Manny Malhotra – who've had careers threatened or ended because they took a puck or a stick in the eye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1979, the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> made helmet use mandatory, but grandfathered the rule so that it remained optional for any players already in the league.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be a simple matter to introduce a comparable rule for visors – simpler actually because every player who comes into the league nowadays has been wearing facial protection from the moment they began playing minor hockey.“There's no logical reason why not to do it – to grandfather it in,” said Souray on Wednesday, a day when the visor debate was reignited around the league. “As a player who's been around for a while, I wouldn't want someone telling me I had to do it. But the game has also changed in the last seven or eight years. There's less fighting. You even see some of the tough guys wearing visors – and they have no problem taking their helmets off so no one gets hurt [in a fight].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“To be honest, I really don't see any logical reason why we wouldn't want to protect the investment of the teams. When you see a player like Marc Staal get injured, you wonder why we haven't done that already.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Staal was examined in New York Wednesday by Mark Fromer, an ophthalmologist, and Mendel Markowitz, a maxillofacial surgeon. Afterward, the team said that Staal's injury had “improved significantly” and said “both doctors are optimistic that Marc will make a full recovery.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Staal will be sidelined indefinitely and to replace him in the lineup, th e Rangers picked up defenceman Roman Hamrlik on waivers from the <span class="companylink">Washington Capitals</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, a lingering, ongoing, controversial discussion needs a tipping point to finally galvanize movement – and perhaps Staal's injury will represent that moment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">NHL</span> has been trying to get visors made mandatory for years, but the <span class="companylink">NHL Players' Association</span> has generally resisted, at the request of its rank-and-file, who are surveyed every year about the matter and steadfastly want to retain the status quo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Visor use has crept up in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>, year over year, and according to NHLPA figures, it is at 73 per cent this year, up from 69 per cent last year. Officially, the NHLPA position hasn't changed, according to Mathieu Schneider, the former player and special assistant to executive director Donald Fehr. In a statement released Wednesday, Schneider reiterated: “While the players support visor use being a matter of individual choice, we continue to regularly educate the players on the benefits of wearing a visor, so each player can make an informed decision.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schneider said the issue, plus other equipment-related matter, would be further explored at the NHLPA's annual summer player meetings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coyotes captain Shane Doan wears a visor now after playing some 900 games without one, and says he is conflicted by the issue. On the one hand, he believes players should have the right to make that choice individually and thus opposes the call for mandatory visors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But as a dad of an 11-year-old boy, I would like him to wear one because he's used to,” Doan said. “It definitely alters your vision. There is no way that anyone can argue that it doesn't.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doan finally relented and donned a visor after getting hit in the nose by a puck on consecutive nights, the second one causing his nose “to explode pretty badly. There was no skin left, so the doctors said I had to have something covering it because if you don't, the next step was going to a skin graft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I had to wear it for a month and a half. I was going to take it off, but the game before I did, I hit Martin Havlat or he hit me and his skate came down across my visor and cut right through it. I had to replace my visor and I was like, ‘Okay, that would have sucked.' ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2000, when he was coaching in the minors, Coyotes assistant coach Jim Playfair, whose career ended because of a detached retina, said he asked his team – the Saint John Flames – to try wearing visors for a week, at practice, and promised them there would be no repercussions from missed plays because of vision errors. Altogether, about seven or eight stuck with them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think we work hard so hard to create safety throughout minor hockey that it's crazy we don't do something more to protect our eyes,” Playfair said. “Doctors protect their eyes in surgery. Welders protect their eyes. People working in construction are always protecting their eyes. Yet we play in a high-paced game and we don't. But I think if we make it mandatory, the players are all going to gravitate towards that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Common sense just tells you, put one on everybody and let's go.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Intervention may eventually come from an interested third party – the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s insurance companies, who could eventually decide not to insure against an eye injury for any player who doesn't don a visor. That would make it cut-and-dried – the financial risks would be too great for any player or team to take.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some will argue that visors do not offer a perfect protective solution and they would be correct. A stick blade can get up under a visor and do some damage. A player can get his face mushed into the boards and cut himself on his visor. But the rewards far outweigh the risks and you only need to shudder at the footage of Staal to realize that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Souray is an old-school, throwback-type of player – physical and steeped in the ethic of the game. He will freely tell you that he came into the league – in the mid-1990s – there was a stigma of sorts attached to wearing a visor. Even his mind is pondering a shift in thinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I came into the league and didn't have to wear a visor, it was almost like a badge of honour,” Souray said. “It was an ‘I'm a man' sort of thing. But so many other things have changed since then. Something as common sense as having a visor or a mouth guard – I chipped my teeth the other day – these are two things, why wouldn't we all be wearing them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm a little stubborn, but after getting this and that,” he said, pointing to his black eye and his chipped tooth, “I don't know anymore. [Wearing a visor], it doesn't make you any less masculine.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a frigid morning in January of 1999, I sat with more than 100 others in Ottawa and listened in fascination to president-elect Hugo Chavez as he warmed a stiff crowd with his own cocktail of business acumen, military bravado, Bolivarian quotes and a few lines of his own poetry.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He laid out his plans to open key sectors such as oil and gas, telecommunications and banking to Canadian investors. He promised to guard the rule of law, maintain a strong and independent judiciary, nurture a free press and defend investor rights. On that day, Brent crude sold for $13 a barrel, the lowest point in real terms since the 1960s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within months, oil prices began to climb and Mr. Chavez quickly realized he needed neither foreign capital nor foreign approval to run his country. As he began to articulate his Bolivarian vision, Venezuela's already divided classes grew further apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The poor were enthralled by the mestizo strongman who began to deliver on many of the promises previous presidents had made as administrators of the world's fourth-largest oil-reserve country. The wealthy grew worried and began to move their assets (and themselves) abroad. But oil revenue was climbing even faster than capital was fleeing and, for nearly a decade, until the global financial crisis hit, Mr. Chavez could make the case that his brand of 21st-century socialism was working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before strong resource prices began to lift Latin America in 2003, the region suffered a “lost half-decade” (1997-2002) and lurched to the left, inspired by the success of Mr. Chavez. Venezuela fostered his new friendships with cash, becoming the largest bilateral lender in Latin America. He single-handedly rescued Cuba's economy and gave relief to the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and others through a beefed-up PetroCaribe program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 1999 to 2008, annual oil revenues captured by state-owned <span class="companylink">Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) </span>grew from $20-billion to $80-billion. Gradually, Mr. Chavez took full control of these moneys by dismantling the checks and balances of government and buying out or firing anyone who stood in his way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To guarantee subsidized food pricing, he nationalized food companies. He took over private media enterprises that challenged his policies. He trumped up murder conspiracy charges against a dozen of the country's leading bank owners to control capital flows. He fired <span class="companylink">PDVSA</span> managers and engineers who stood up against his politicization of a once highly efficient energy giant. He created a militia of 125,000 who reported directly to him and helped to implement many of his social programs, thus bypassing democratically elected state and municipal leaders. He showered the military with money, contracts and power, then inserted Cuban spies to help prevent a coup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the money flowed, many of Mr. Chavez's abuses of power were forgiven by the underclass, which relished the sight of struggling upper and middle classes. In return, they re-elected him three times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chavez's Robin Hood policies delivered political success and facilitated a power grab unequalled in Latin America since the dictatorships of the 1970s and 1980s. More important, he squandered an economic gift of almost $700-billion in additional oil revenue that his 14 years in power received versus the preceding 14 years (1985-1999).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The divide between the poor and the rich has shrunk, but only because the rich and middle classes became poorer. The murder rate has doubled and, in Caracas, has quadrupled since 1999. When measured at the official rate of exchange, GDP per capita in dollars has doubled, but that's a false reality. When measured by the grey market rate where most imports are purchased, GDP per capita is below where it stood in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buoyed by comparatively less dramatic boosts to their economies, Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Chile have all surged ahead of Venezuela. Unlike Venezuela, the populist policies in those countries that helped lift millions out of poverty were accompanied by the rule of law, strong political opposition, respect for investor rights and a vigorous, independent press. May those countries and their lessons learned be a source of inspiration for Venezuela's next chapter.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show is over. Hugo Chavez made Venezuela a talking point for the world, baiting U.S. presidents, firing officials on live TV, playing footsie with Iran and promising to spread Bolivarian socialism across the region. When he died Tuesday, his name was known around the globe.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one else can be like El Comandante. Venezuelan rule was built around his personality. His erratic charisma made him an occasional disturbance for Canada in its relations with Latin America. But for all his autocratic tendencies at home and his promises to spread revolution, he was always more a distraction than a threat. His death is an opportunity to move on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Baird, the Foreign Affairs Minister, was taking a gamble on that when he planned to visit with Vice-President Nicolas Maduro two weeks ago, a trip that was called off when the ailing Mr. Chavez returned to Venezuela for his last days. For Canada, there's a potential for larger trade if Mr. Maduro, or whomever replaces him, decides to open the economy wider. And there's the possibility that with the lightning rod gone, relations will move forward – or at least stop being a distraction from the bigger business of expanding trade and ties in Latin America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The early signs are not promising. Venezuela's deputy foreign minister, Claudia Salerno, sent a letter blasting Stephen Harper's condolence statement – which hoped for a future Venezuela based on “democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights” – as “insensitive and impertinent.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, if anything can be predicted now about Venezuela's future leadership, it's that it won't be quite like Hugo Chavez.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was an elected autocrat, who used state levers and blacklists to repress opponents. On the world stage, he attacked “imperialists,” but still exported oil to the United States. He sent subsidized oil to Cuba, and attracted allies like Bolivia's Evo Morales in lambasting the United States. But he never really built regional power. “He was entertaining, but that masked the fact that he didn't really have that much influence in the world,” a former Canadian diplomat said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of his innovations was Alo Presidente, the Sunday television talk show he hosted, where he rattled off his largely unscripted thoughts, visited social-welfare projects, quizzed government ministers, attacked American imperialists and, on one occasion, ordered a general to send battalions of troops to the Colombian border. “George W. Bush,” he said on a 2006 instalment, broadcast from a farm, “you are a donkey.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His TV charisma was a form of government. Officials would parrot his lines from the show as operating principles for governing, one former Canadian diplomat said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American politicians loved to rise to Mr. Chavez's bait, attacking the “dictator” as a global threat. The reaction seemed to be just what Mr. Chavez wanted, and fuelled the populist strongman image his supporters embraced. Occasionally, Mr. Harper and his government fired at him, too, and the Chavistas would label them right-wing imperialists. Mr. Harper's disdain for him was clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Canada's increasing interest in emerging markets has the Harper government trying to expand trade and ties in Latin America. They focused mostly on countries such as Colombia and Chile that don't care for Chavismo, but now, as they seek to broaden efforts with countries such as Brazil, spats with Venezuela are a distraction in hemispheric relations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the most part, Mr. Chavez's policies never did have much impact on Canada's hard interests. The more fanciful policies that did raise concerns, like forging ties with Iran, might just die with him. Now that he's gone, the Chavistas might revert to a period of imperialist baiting – but without his personal adulation, they may soon be forced to focus on domestic problems such as inflation, corruption and crime. Ottawa would be wise to ignore the bait and hope to move forward, because none of his successors will ever take the global stage like Hugo Chavez.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's general election in Kenya was always going to be complex.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first vote since the proclamation of a new constitution in August of 2010, Kenyans went to the polls to choose a new president, members of the legislative assembly and 47 county governors and county councillors. The hope was that the election could be conducted without the violence that marred the last one, in December of 2007, when disputed results sparked long-standing tensions among tribes and led to the deaths of more than 1,000 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results announced late Thursday gave the lead to Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta and his Kikuyu-dominated coalition but pushed him below the 50-per-cent threshold he would need to avoid a runoff in April or May. A close race and a troubled vote count can't help but spark fears of post-election violence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other main contender, Prime Minister Raila Odinga, is already alleging vote-rigging. There's also the issue of a large number of spoiled ballots – this needs to be explained, either by the electoral commission or, ultimately, by the courts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenya is by no means out of the woods yet, but none of this was to be unexpected: In either case, the loser would cry foul. One of the realities of Kenyan politics, and life, is that too much remains divided along tribal lines. The Kikuyu (party of the father of Kenya, Jomo Kenyatta, the father of Uhuru) consider themselves the natural governing people of Kenya. The Prime Minister's tribe, the Luo, is half the size of the Kikuyu and can gain electoral success only by forming coalitions with other, smaller tribes. While many Western supporters of Kenya have been arguing for a “one Kenya” approach leading up to this election, it's hard to break traditional tribal and familty loyalties in what remains a largely rural nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other elephant in the room is that both Uhuru Kenyatta and his vice-presidential running mate, William Ruto, have been indicted by the <span class="companylink">International Criminal Court</span> for offences that occurred in the violence that followed the 2007 vote. It's entirely possible that these two men facing serious criminal charges could be the new president and vice-president of Kenya.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given this possibility, both the United States and the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> have suggested that Kenya will face “consequences” if Mr. Kenyatta and Mr. Ruto are elected. And if they are, it will certainly make governance in Kenya difficult at a time when there will be appeals to the courts regarding the electoral outcome. An extended period of uncertainty will cripple investment and cast a pall over what are now being seen as sunnier times for Africa in general and Kenya in particular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the result is close, Mr. Odinga, the Prime Minister, and his supporters will claim that the election was stolen from them. This will increase agitation up to the runoff and intensify lobbying to gain the votes of the third contender, Deputy Prime Minister Musalia Mudavadi. This will not augur well for a peaceful conclusion to the electoral process in Kenya.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Seuss, who died in 1991, would have turned 109 this week. I'm still not ready to say good-bye to him, but my kids are. My Grade 4 boy, now far from Mulberry Street, sneaks night reads with Roald Dahl and Amulet. My Grade 2 girl is good friends with rabble-rouser heroines Ramona and Clementine.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That they read at all is because of school and bookish parents, but that they might become readers for life is because of Dr. Seuss. Many kids' books have passed through our house, and a lot of them were fine but safe, following the adage that children's books should be comforting; stuffies made of paper. Good night-ing moons and bunny-tracking moms spun a safe cocoon that had its place in the early years. But Dr. Seuss was something else, a bridge between reading for security and reading because it matters, as Fran Lebowitz wrote: “Think before you speak. Read before you think.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone with kids has noticed how many picture books lack those uniquely Seussian gusts of imagination. Granted, some contemporary children's lit is pretty funny: There's Olivia the pig girl, precocious in her New York apartment as her parents roll their eyes at her outfit changes and bedroom-wall vandalism (she was channelling Pollock). But the humour is sitcom schematic, with set-up and punch line, and not much story. Enjoyable, but not edifying, and never uncanny. For the bubble-wrapped generation, Seuss is a parent-free zone and an imperative flirtation with strangeness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beneath the pop-bright pictures, Seuss's stories are subversive and weird, even scary. Flying beasts are crippled by tail-feather envy; shy elephants are mocked; children are abandoned to domestic terrorist cats. The language is rhythmic and lush, a first taste of poetry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Seuss was neither doctor nor Seuss, born Theodor Geisel in Springfield, Mass., in 1904. He had been writing children's books for 20 years when a publisher at <span class="companylink">Houghton Mifflin</span> connected faltering American literacy rates to the dullness of Dick and Jane-type readers, and commissioned Geisel to come up with a book that would help kids read phonetically, rather than through repetition. Drawing from lists of simple words, Geisel produced The Cat in the Hat in 1957 – 1,702 words long but built from only 220 different words in rhymed anapestic dimeter. That clean, simple rhythm bores into kids' brains, though it can, on occasion, bore into adults' brains, too, in a bad way (never attempt the old turn-two-pages-at-once trick with Green Eggs and Ham; truth will out).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, the behatted Cat is a cat, but in Seuss, verisimilitude doesn't have dominion: What exactly is Sam-I-Am, hero of Green Eggs and Ham? He's furry, but he isn't an animal projection; no stereotyped shucking and jiving zebra from Madagascar. And what about Sneetches, Grinches and Whos? We now know these creatures so well that it's easy to forget how weird they are, citizens of worlds that hover between the real and the unreal – surrealist, by definition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seuss's least compelling works are also his least strange, and his most political, as in The Lorax, a preachy environmental allegory that verges on sermon. His social-justice agenda was more powerfully served through lovable oddities: Horton Hatches the Egg is surely the first book on same-sex adoption, but it's also about Horton, an outcast elephant doing his thing, convention be damned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, the real-world proxy pig Olivia is part of a slew of contemporary children's books in which parents are tired and kids rule the roost (or pen). Well, of course: Parenting has become an industry of books and TV shows and $2,500 strollers and bloggers charting gluten-free anxieties. And so we get Olivia, and Pinkalicious, a girly-girl brat who eats so many cupcakes she turns pink while her mom stands by helplessly. In one of Mo Willems's charming Knuffle Bunny series, a toddler's screams dictate that a beleaguered dad run back to a Park Slope laundromat in the middle of the night to retrieve a missing stuffed rabbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As many sociologists have noted, this (okay, my) generation of parents is inserting itself into their kids' narratives, standing by the slide shouting “Good job!” and then a few years later, accompanying their twentysomething to job interviews. Parents are mostly absent in Seuss, thank God: In The Cat in the Hat, the mom's mysterious leaving triggers the chaos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kids love chaos, and Seuss brims with it. He shows children how to be disarmed and step into a character's skin, which defines good reading. Reading means surrendering to the abnormal, bearing witness, getting lost – kid stuff. For all our exhausting parental effort, we can't protect our children from cruelty and mess. They discover that truth while they're young and apart from us, and, if they're lucky, in the wild spaces of a good book, when they should be sleeping.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the last federal election, Jack Layton courted Quebec voters with a number of intemperate promises, including extending Quebec language legislation into areas of federal jurisdiction, and advocating more seats for Quebec in any riding redistribution, even though its population does not justify them. The NDP's strategy worked wonders in the election, when they won 59 out of 75 seats in the province, and the prize of official opposition in Ottawa. It should have been enough of a good thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sooner or later, playing footsie with separatists in Quebec was going to harm a federalist party, and it has. Thomas Mulcair, the current leader, took the bait in the form of a mischievous Bloc Québécois motion to change the rules for Quebec secession by pledging to repeal the Clarity Act.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bloc motion was handily defeated on Wednesday, but that wasn't the point. It was a strategic win, because they succeeded in weakening the NDP nationally by exposing the unacceptable NDP position, which is that a bare majority of 50 per cent plus one in a referendum vote should be enough to trigger negotiations on Quebec secession. “The side that wins wins,” Mr. Mulcair declared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the NDP plan, it would be easier to trigger negotiations over the breakup of the country than it would be to amend the New Democrats' own party constitution, which requires a two-thirds majority. With the party so clearly catering to Quebec nationalist and soft-sovereigntist sentiments, the defection last week of Claude Patry, the MP for Jonquière-Alma, to sit with the Bloc rump, must have been a stinging blow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he announced his defection, Mr. Patry made it clear that he is a longstanding supporter of separatism: “I voted for Quebec sovereignty in the last two referendums. I hoped that Quebec should become a country and I still hope for that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remarkably, the MP said he decided to change parties as a result of Mr. Mulcair's position, which is widely seen as too weak outside Quebec but too strong for people like Mr. Patry, who rejected the idea that any referendum question should be deemed satisfactory by the federal government. He said this “demonstrates unequivocally that the party favours Canada's interest over those of the Quebec nation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is astonishing that someone in the New Democrats' Quebec caucus could have been led to believe otherwise. Clearly, Mr. Mulcair needs to stand up for more than social-democratic values.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A very close, dear friend of mine has chosen other people for her wedding party. We've had our ups and downs, but I've always stood by her. She's selected her family, and confusingly two other seemingly random people. I always thought we were peas in a pod, so this totally caught me off guard and hurt my feelings, and caused me to wonder how good a friendship we actually have. She takes no interest in my life now, and only plans “couple's nights” out. She's told me she didn't want to have to pick between me and another friend, but has also hinted she's unimpressed with my singledom, weight and smaller income level. She has gone on about the importance of me being there, but I can't help but feel slighted. I'm starting to wonder if I should go to the wedding. How should I deal with this?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ANSWER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By sucking it up, getting over yourself, going to the wedding, and having fun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who cares what your status within the hierarchy of the event is? Weddings are a ball, and soon enough you'll be older and you won't be invited to so many and you'll miss them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyway, you're being a bit of a Friendzilla. In my opinion, it's rude not to go to a wedding you've been invited to, for any reason other than you can't make it (asterisk: or it's one of these “destination weddings” and you can't afford it), but especially if your poopy-diaper reason is you weren't asked to be part of the wedding party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've said this before, but I guess it bears repeating (I'm going for a Lao Tzu-like aphoristic feel here, though I'm aware it might come off as Yoda-ish): “One's spiritual development may be measured by the extent to which one realizes that unless one is the bride or groom, the wedding really isn't about … one.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Okay. Lao Tzu I'm not, but the point is: This isn't about you! It's about her and him trying to make a go of a lifetime together, and you are there to witness and support their solemn vows, scarf some coconut shrimp and lamb lollipops, washed down with the beverage of your choice, then shake it like a Polaroid picture on the dance floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, and maybe meet some dude. Weddings are a great place for that, as everyone knows, and by your own testimonial you're single, so why not go simply for selfish reasons? Dirty-dance some inebriated groomsman then push him into a broom closet. Could be the start of a beautiful relationship!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having said all that, I think you're quite right to wonder if the bride-to-be is as “close” and “dear” a friend as you think. My guess is she does have her reasons for not including you in her wedding party, and just doesn't want to come out and tell you what they are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If I peer even more closely at the tea leaves I feel like I, Yodalicious Swami Dave, can even sense the shadowy contours of her possible problem with you. I mean, I look at a statement like, “I've always stood by her even when she wasn't at her best,” and see classic passive-aggressive frenemy sophistry. I can almost see you “defending” her to her other frenemies while gleefully sticking pins in the voodoo doll of her character.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course it'd be a shame if you were right, if she were “unimpressed,” as you eloquently put it, by your singledom, weight and poorness. In that case, obviously, she's not much of a friend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Far more likely, though, is one of the “downs” of your “ups and downs” rankled and stuck with her and she had a hard time getting over it and now you're cooling your skate-heels in her personal penalty box.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that is the case, I would approach her, way down the road, long after the Champagne bubbles have popped, the rental tuxes been returned and the honeymoon tans have faded, and ask her what you've done to be demoted from Most Favoured BFF status to merely part of her social life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When faced with a humble, heartfelt plea like that, my bet is she tells you, straight up. It might sting at first, but if you swallow your pride and listen to what she says then you can begin the process of reparations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, show her, by taking the high road, going to the wedding and cheering her on in you-go-girl type fashion, what a good, unselfish friend you can be. Do all this, and maybe she'll make you a bridesmaid at her next wedding.</p>
