<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In most buildings, there is no 13th floor, because 13 is considered an unlucky number in many cultures. Why the lingering prejudice against such a noble number? It's time to end the superstition, and the year 2013 is the perfect time to do it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the most bizarre current case of triskaidekaphobia, as the fear of 13 is known to people who like their phobias to have names, is Ireland's decision to change the way it numbers its licence plates in 2013. Where in the normal course of events the first two digits on an Irish licence plate represent the last two digits of the year a car was registered, this year the plates will begin with 131 if they are registered in the first six months of the year, and 132 for all the rest. This decision was made by the government with the collaboration of the auto industry, which feared Irish people might be less likely to buy new cars in 2013 if it meant their plates would begin with the number 13.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fear of 13 goes back to less sophisticated times, and is mostly due, it seems, to the world's love of the number 12. There are 12 months in a year, 12 Zodiac signs, 12 apostles, 12 days of Christmas, 12 inches in a foot, 12 cookies in a dozen, and so on. Hence, 13 seemed unlucky, and it didn't help that Judas was considered to be the 13th guest at the Last Supper. Many people in many countries still think it bad luck to set the table for more than 12 and less than 14.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we're past that, aren't we? The 2012 doomsday prophecy was based on the Mayan date 13.0.0.0.0, and we all saw how that worked out. In fact, in many ways 13 deserves to be celebrated. In math, it's the first “emirp” – a prime number that gives a different prime when its digits are reversed. It's also a “happy number” and a “Fibonacci number” (we don't pretend to know what all this means, but it's important). None of these things can be said of 12. In sports, 13 was sewn onto the jerseys of Wilt Chamberlain, Mats Sundin, Steve Nash, Alex Rodriguez and numerous other greats. And you can't benefit from the generosity of a baker's dozen without the number 13, can you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now 2013 is here. If years were an elevator, we might have gone straight past it to 2014, but we didn't. It's time to embrace lucky, happy 13 once and for all.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A popular rebellion against impunity manifested itself in 2012, after a series of grotesque crimes against the vulnerable. In other years, people rose up against the impunity of the state and its officials – a theme of the Arab Spring. In the year just ended, tens of thousands of protesters against a Taliban shooting in Pakistan and a gang rape in India signalled a broad movement against the cultural norms and state policies that promote impunity for crimes against girls and women. In Canada, the norms of a free and open Internet that bullies hide behind came under sustained attack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three girls and women victimized in brutal and callous ways provided touchstones of universal power. Just as more people understand the Holocaust through Anne Frank's diary than perhaps any other source, the emergence in 2012 of three individuals whose lives of promise were cut short, in two cases, and nearly ended in a third, moved large numbers of people to action.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amanda Todd, 15, of Port Coquitlam, B.C., spoke in plaintive handheld signs on an Internet video about the pain of cyberbullying and ostracism, before taking her life. Malala Yousafzai, 14, of Pakistan's Swat Valley, was targeted for assassination by the Taliban because she spoke out for girls' right to go to school. An unnamed 23-year-old trying to escape rural poverty and her low-caste status by studying physiotherapy in New Delhi died from injuries suffered in a gang rape on a moving bus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resisting impunity meant pushing government and less visible targets – the social foundations of impunity. In Canada, reaching those who join in ostracism is a complex task; laws holding bystanders to account are on the way. In India, all parties have fielded candidates charged with crimes against women, a measure of the crimes' acceptance. In Pakistan, religious schools spread oppressive attitudes toward women and girls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As in the Arab Spring, victory is far from assured. And there is a battleground in its early days – a battle against the United States' gun culture, and the laws (or lack therof) that support it. The massacre of 20 children and six educators at a Connecticut elementary school, like the crimes against Malala, Amanda and the unnamed student, was so outrageous it made silence seem like complicity. But impunity was on the defensive, and our wish for the New Year is that the resistance to it makes concrete gains.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is an old Spanish proverb: “It is not the same to talk of bulls as to be in the bull ring.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And let's face it, folks: A lot of the resolutions we make on this day will prove, in the fullness of time, to be “talk of bulls.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent study following 3,000 people found that by the end of the year, 88 per cent had failed to stick to their resolution. And according to a recent survey by Virgin Mobile Canada, more than half of us say “uncle” and throw in the towel by the end of January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So how to stick to your guns? Me, I look to my childhood hero and the man I consider the patron saint of trying hard and never, ever giving up: tennis great Jimmy Connors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be clear: I never gave a crap about tennis, or any sports, really, as a kid. I was a bookworm, a nerd. But I found the spectacle of Jimmy Connors playing tennis electrifying. His opponent would drop some dinky little drop shot over the net and Jimmy Connors would be way over on the other side and you'd be sitting there thinking: “Oh, well, good point, too bad, Jimmy, can't win 'em all.” His opponent would practically be sauntering to the sidelines for a swig of water…. And then you'd notice that Jimmy was going for it! This impossible shot! And you'd be thinking: “No, no, Jimmy, please, you're embarrassing yourself, sometimes you just have to accept when you've lost the point.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then, to your amazement, he'd get it! And win the point! And that's when a look of doubt would start to cross his opponent's face. … And the tennis commentators, as tennis commentators will, would immediately begin to switch from talking about how “troubled” his career had been lately to how “on fire” it was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So that's how I'm going to be this year. Two quotes attributed to Jimmy Connors are my twin mottos: 1) “People don't seem to understand it's a damn war out there,” and 2) “Rather than viewing a brief relapse back to inactivity as a failure, treat it as a challenge and try to get back on track as soon as possible.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And those are my twin resolutions: 1) To remember “it's a damn war out there,” and 2) To go after everything, no matter how sad and tragic the spectacle might be to various pundits and commentators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Okay, no more “talking of bulls.” Time for all of us to get into the ring, take our vices, demons, shortcomings and setbacks by the horns, and hang on for dear life. Toro! Onwards!</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite all its frustrations and inconveniences, flying remains a miracle. Tons of metal and fuel, floating above the clouds, whisking us across continents and oceans in the space of hours. Outside the windows, it is minus 10 bazillion, but inside, we're warm, watching the latest Hollywood movies while being served fruit juice, coffee and tea.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a luxury that would have been utterly unimaginable to kings and emperors just a century ago, but today it is so common that we take the wonder of it all for granted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My mother, born before the widespread onset of civil aviation, enthusiastically recalls her first flight, a transatlantic odyssey from Toronto to London at the age of 19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In those days, everyone dressed up for such occasions; hats, gloves, high heels, tuxedos. Flight was a marvel worthy of celebrating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What a far cry from today, when the indignities of modern air travel (the sorry-nothing-but-a-middle-seat, the electronic check-in machines, the all-pervasive sense of being herded like cattle, the unspoken-armrest-elbow-jostling, the three-bucks-for-headphones-thank-you-very-much) have grown so gnawing and so prevalent that they threaten to define the entire experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all airline passengers make one resolution this New Year's Day, it should be to never forget the miracle of modern flight and refuse to be dragged down by the frustration and impatience that now grip our airports and planes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I flew to Toronto in the days before Christmas, when bulging carry-ons, winter coats and bags of presents – coupled with the widespread refusal to check anything at all – meant overhead space was at a premium. Passengers were twitchy long before boarding started, and a mini-stampede broke out as the flight was called.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few fliers waited for their row to be called, some boarded regardless and most hovered so close to the ticket agents that no one knew who was getting on or where the lineup was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the overhead space was jammed almost instantly, and the aisle clogged with frustrated and confused patrons. The purser called for remaining bags to be brought forward and checked, but no one could move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time the shemozzle was sorted and the plane pushed back from the gate – more than 45 minutes late – the cabin was full of grumpy folks. It went downhill from there, with malfunctioning entertainment systems, crying kids, exasperated flight attendants and spilled drinks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disembarking was a joke, some folks literally climbing over seat backs to get ahead. For what? To get off the plane five seconds earlier?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My neighbour, a pilot with decades of experience, confirms such chaos is the new norm. But it doesn't have to be this way. We can fight back. We have the power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, our lives and schedules are tighter than ever, meaning even a five-minute delay can be stressful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, slow security lines and overcrowded terminals would test even a monk's patience. But pause for a moment to consider the alternative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter how delayed your flight, you'd never travel from Vancouver to Toronto (or St. John's or Montreal or Winnipeg) faster by car, train, bicycle, foot or horse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two generations ago, crossing the country demanded a week-long commitment. Two centuries ago, the effort required was monumental. Lewis and Clark endured 18 gruelling months of travel before reaching the Pacific.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, we cover their route in the time it takes to watch the latest Batman movie. And we get bent out of shape when the person in front of us is a bit slow getting off the plane?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How do we return civility and humanity to flying? Simple. Lead by example. Don't point fingers. Behave the way your mother taught you. And, above all, remember it is a miracle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A TRAVELLER'S CREED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If enough people take these New Year's travel resolutions to heart, we might just change the flying world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't stand inches from the gate during boarding, waiting to leap in the moment your row is called. This leaves everyone confused. It's not a race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Board when your row number is called. Not before. Simple.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you have more carry-on luggage than permitted, check it. (Airlines could go a long way toward easing carry-on tensions by enforcing size rules. Better yet, eliminate all uncertainty by dividing overhead compartments into small spaces and assigning one to each seat.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Have patience with those who may not fly as often as you do – the young and old, the bumblers, the lost. They need your help, not your anger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greet the person who sits down beside you (without engaging them in an unwanted multi-hour conversation).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When disembarking, don't squeeze ahead of passengers trying to retrieve baggage from overhead bins. You may have saved five seconds, but for what? It's rude. Wait your turn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you have a tight connection, speak up. And if someone behind you explains they have such a dilemma, let them go by with a smile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't stand inches away from the baggage carousel. If everyone stood back until their bag appeared, the process would be much easier.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- As Washington insiders raced to designate the winners and losers in a “fiscal cliff” deal winding its tortuous way through Congress, a very different assessment of the political players was being made in the diners of the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are all losers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voter disgust with a Congress that had already earned the distinction of being the least productive in decades was outdone only by bewilderment about the politicians' inability to deal with the country's problems, fiscal or otherwise, like regular adults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Something has gone terribly wrong when the biggest threat to our American economy is the American Congress,” West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin mused as the White House and congressional leaders scrambled to avert more than $500-billion (U.S.) in recession-inducing tax increases and spending cuts that were set to kick in on Jan. 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It should be embarrassing to all of us that it took until the last hours of the last day of the year to address an issue we should have dealt with months ago,” said Arizona Republican Senator John McCain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such self-flagellation cannot make up for the fact that the “deal” that passed the Senate in the early hours of New Year's Day, and passed the House of Representatives late Tuesday night, is a sorry excuse of a solution to a problem that requires bigger answers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Provided a bill actually makes it through Congress, it will merely buy the politicians a couple more months to procrastinate about the country's fiscal time bomb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, the same nerve-racking uncertainty and brinksmanship will be repeated all over again in February or March when President Barack Obama formally asks Congress to raise the government's $16.4-trillion debt ceiling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best-case scenario may be another short-term bill that tides the <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> over until the next quick fix. Just don't expect Congress to pass it a second before it has to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama and the Republican House Speaker John Boehner keep saying they want to reach a “grand bargain” that fixes the long-term fiscal mess for at least a decade. But after two miserable failures, no one is really expecting them to be third time lucky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans rightly get most of the blame for this gridlock. But Mr. Obama is also complicit in this dysfunction. He has shown disdain for the sausage-making process and tried to float above it. But the most effective presidents have been up to their elbows in it, knowing when to flatter or bribe opposition members of Congress to get bills passed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiously, Mr. Obama sought to rub House Republican faces in the fiscal-cliff deal that Vice-President Joe Biden and GOP Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell negotiated on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For the first time in 20 years, Congress will have acted on a bipartisan basis to vote for significant new revenues,” the White House said in a “fact sheet” touting the tax increases on the wealthy Mr. Obama snagged as part of the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration might have waited until the House had actually passed the deal before pointing that out. Doing so beforehand made it harder for many House Republicans to vote for it. That led to hours of additional uncertainty on Tuesday as Republicans considered amending the deal, a development that could have led to its demise. They wisely dropped that idea, knowing they were risking a bloody reaction on financial markets on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is this any way to run a country, much less the world's most important one?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a long time, Americans – and Canadians for that matter – viewed the free agency in Congress as an almost admirable quirk of a political system forged out of a revolutionary mentality and deep distrust of government. But if the founders wanted to make legislating hard, they did not likely intend for it to be self-destructive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, that is what it has become. To wit, the Senate Chaplain's opening prayer on Sunday, asking God to “save us from self-inflicted wounds.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new Congress takes over on Thursday. But nothing will change. A new round of extreme gerrymandering after the 2010 census ensured that the politicians elected last fall will worry more about losing a primary challenge, from the right or left, than their next general election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result will be even greater polarization in Congress and an endless series of unproductive confrontations. Actual governing will continue to take a back seat to drawing ideological lines in the sand. And the consequences will only grow more dire.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Syrian civil war has reached a point at which the international community – that is to say, the world's responsible powers – needs to take a more active hand, still with caution, favouring carefully selected insurgent groups that are not Salafist, and have no affinities to al-Qaeda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The greatest danger in the medium term is that Syria will be fragmented into an unstable patchwork of warlords and militias, comparable to Somalia, Lebanon or the former Yugoslavia in their civil-war periods.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In such chaos, a group such as Jabhat al-Nusra, a Syrian group affiliated to the Iraqi factions that are in turn aligned with al-Qaeda, could well find and keep a foothold. On Dec. 11, the United States designated Jabhat al-Nusra as a terrorist organization. The U.S. was right to do so, marking an important differentiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the United States and other Western countries should be prepared to consider supplying equipment, such as surface-to-air missiles, to certain opposition groups. The Muslim Brotherhood was savagely repressed by Hafez al-Assad, the father of President Bashar al-Assad, but it is probably the one large opposition movement with longstanding roots in the country. Of course, the Brotherhood has many flaws – as Egypt and indeed Turkey show – but the West would be ill-advised to treat members of a likely future Syrian government simply as carriers of ideological plague. For one thing, these Sunni Islamists would release Syria from its status as a client-state of Iran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The opposition to Mr. al-Assad has now had so much success in so many parts of the country that it is most unlikely that his Baathist regime can survive for very long. The families of much of the ruling elite are already being moved to an enclave dominated by the Alawite sect, to which the Assad family and most of the high ranks of the Baathist Party belong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. al-Assad and his colleagues resort to chemical weapons, foreign intervention would become almost inevitable and indeed morally desirable. For the present, the Western world ought to apply a range of incentives and pressures to encourage pragmatism and tolerance among the rising factions of Syria.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everything about him – teeth, skin, shock of hair, percolating grin – says “adolescent,” when usually 17-year-olds who play in world championships have been described as “already men.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world junior hockey championship, after all, is for under-20s and is commonly referred to as a tournament for 19-year-olds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even that other 17-year-old Canadian, Nathan MacKinnon – the precocious young forward from Sidney Crosby's hometown of Cole Harbour, N.S. – looks like a “compact man” with his square jaw and soldier's stare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not Jonathan Drouin. If Team Canada ever awards him the Cape of the Game he'll probably ask for the mask and plastic sword that goes with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He gets a little giddy talking about himself. He talks so fast, in both official languages, that his mouth seems a full time zone in front of his thoughts, which may well be because he's afraid to think about what's happening to him and has chosen, instead, to cover up with such a solid stream of clichés that it makes the attending media, well … giddy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we will have to speak for him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seventeen-year-olds aren't even supposed to make these teams. It happens, but rarely. You can easily identify them on the ice, as <span class="companylink">International Ice Hockey Federation</span> rules require under-18s wear the full mask/cage rather than the half visor the older under-20s choose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evgeni Malkin, the scoring leader and MVP the last time the NHL had a season, played in the WJC at 17, but Malkin already towered over most of his teammates and opponents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also the case of John Tavares, a natural goal scorer who was chosen for the team at 17 in 2008, played a small role, but gained enough experience that the following year, Ottawa in 2009, he led Team Canada to its last gold medal and was chosen tournament MVP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And finally, there is Wayne Gretzky, who was Wayne Gretzky. He hadn't quite turned 17 when the tournament was held in Montreal in 1978 but led all tournament scorers in points with 17 in only six games. The following year he might have again played at 17 but for the fact he had already turned professional with the World Hockey Association's Indianapolis Racers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What, then, to make of this young man from Ste-Agathe, Que., who talks almost as fast as he skates?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is already one great surprise of the 2013 world juniors, it is clearly Jonathan Drouin of Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, head coach Steve Spott made the surprise announcement that Drouin would be moved to the top line and take the spot that had previously gone to Jonathan Huberdeau. Drouin would join team captain Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and Mark Scheifele, two much older juniors who are also NHL “veterans.” (Well, Scheifele had a handful of games last year with the <span class="companylink">Winnipeg Jets</span> and “RNH” would likely have been chosen NHL rookie of the year had it not been for injury.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spott called it a different “look” but the fact is he knew, as all who follow these junior championships know, that if Canada has one weakness that has kept them away from the gold medal since Tavares's year in Ottawa, it is scoring punch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I got to the rink I saw the board with the lineup,” Drouin says, “I was pretty happy about that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, too, was Spott. The effect was magical: Scheifele and Drouin both scored as Canada defeated co-favourite Russia 4-1. Drouin was chosen Canadian player of the game when it was over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drouin's play, right from training camp, has been so mature, so solid that he is the talk of the scouts gathering here in increasing numbers. There were said to be three candidates in Ufa for No.1 pick overall in the next NHL draft: MacKinnon and Drouin for Canada and Seth Jones for the United States. While none has faltered, Drouin has cleared soared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The draft is in June,” Drouin says, “But right not we're not here to think about it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others are, however, and he has to be acutely aware of this no matter what his motor mouth is claiming: “I don't think about stuff like that. The goal helped the team. It didn't help my stats or anything. We're here to win a gold medal.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is hard to believe that not much more than a year ago this kid, who used to dream of playing with Joe Sakic and Peter Forsberg of the <span class="companylink">Colorado Avalanche</span>, was playing midget hockey for the Lac <span class="companylink">St. Louis Lions</span>. He jumped from AAA competition straight into the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, joining the Halifax Mooseheads where he was soon on a line with the gifted MacKinnon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few saw him coming. He wasn't even on Team Canada's radar last summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one, it seemed, predicted that he would command a look from Team Canada by averaging two points a game near the halfway point of the current season. When Spott flew to Halifax to get a look at MacKinnon and Drouin he was able only to watch MacKinnon, as Drouin – a rather fearless little player who seems to prefer traffic to open ice – was too banged up to play. Still, Spott heard so much about the youngster – his quick feet, his creative hands, his ability to shield the puck from checkers – that he agreed with those who insisted Drouin be invited to the Calgary camp. The youngster was so dominant in a couple of exhibition games the coaches felt they had no option but to give him a spot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None, however, saw that spot as on Canada's top line.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a traumatic year for Quebeckers, who were successively subjected to a four-month, often violent student revolt, then to an election that resulted in a gaffe-prone minority government and finally to a nauseating outpouring of corruption scandals.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year started with polls predicting the demise of the Parti Québécois after some party militants had launched a series of public, vicious attacks against their leader, Pauline Marois. But she bravely stood her ground and eventually won the nickname of Concrete Lady – a reference to Margaret Thatcher's iron-like determination. After this episode, though, Ms. Marois returned to her usual impulsive and rather soft style of leadership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By midwinter, the tables had turned. The Coalition Avenir Québec, the third party that had soared in the polls during the previous year, began to lose steam, and the PQ was enjoying a small lead in voters' intentions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then came the student revolt – a huge turmoil over a small matter (a modest hike of university tuition fees) that, incredibly, turned out to be even more divisive than the two referendums on sovereignty. The atmosphere, especially in the Montreal area, became so emotional that lifelong friends stopped talking to each other and families were fractured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revolt had a larger dimension, as a coalition of trade unions, the PQ and a host of leftist groups used the student conflict to wage war against the Liberal government of Jean Charest. Ms. Marois, who had often called for a rise in tuition, made a spectacular flip-flop and turned herself into an unconditional supporter of the student rebels, happily sporting their “red square” emblem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This probably cost the PQ the majority it could have won in the election because, on this issue, two-thirds of Quebeckers were on the side of the government. Many were disgusted to see the Official Opposition take the side of the “street” against a duly elected government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By September, Ms. Marois had fulfilled her dream of becoming Quebec's first female premier. This achievement, though, was marred by what appeared to be an assassination attempt on the very night of the election and also by the fact that her victory is hardly a first for women in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PQ minority government's first steps were pathetic. Its half-baked initiatives (most notably a retroactive tax on higher revenues and investment income that the PQ had never mentioned during the election campaign) met a barrage of fury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Péquistes quickly backed away from their most controversial plans, but they never enjoyed the honeymoon usually bestowed on newly elected governments. Others took comfort in the thought that things would be much worse if the PQ had won a majority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, according to the latest opinion polls, the PQ is ahead of the opposition by a small lead, thanks in part to the disorganization of the Quebec Liberal Party, which is both leaderless and badly tainted by allegations of illegal financing. The Liberals will choose a new leader in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year ended with a flurry of devastating revelations on corruption, as the Charbonneau commission unveiled a system of kickbacks in public works contracts. Until now, the public has mostly heard about corrupt contractors and corrupted civil servants at the municipal level, but it's expected that the next round of hearings, in January, will target former provincial politicians. Who knows what consequences this will have on the next election?</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crime seems incomprehensible. A 23-year-old physiotherapy student is dead, 12 days after having been raped for more than an hour by six men in a bus travelling on main roads in the Indian capital. Her internal injuries from the iron rod that her attackers used were so severe that doctors had to remove her intestines in their effort to save her life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indians, it seems, have had enough. Dozens of large and increasingly angry demonstrations have been held to demand that the government ensure women's security and stop treating rapists with impunity. While the authorities have sought to quell the protests – cordoning off central New Delhi and subjecting the rest of the city to traffic restrictions – violence has escalated. After a policeman died, live ammunition was fired into the crowds – killing a journalist, Bwizamani Singh, and provoking a rebuke from <span class="companylink">Reporters without Borders</span>.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not simply the high rate of rape in India that's driving the protests' virulence. In a passionate speech, Kavita Krishnan, secretary of the All India Progressive Women's Association, spoke to the deeper issue behind the protests: the “blame the victim” culture in India around sex crimes. She notes that government and police officials recently insisted that most rapists can't be prosecuted in India because, as one official put it, they are known to the women attacked. Other officials have publicly suggested that victims themselves are “asking for it” by their use of freedom of movement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This return to pre-feminist discourse is not confined to India. Italy is having a similar debate about whether women's clothes and behaviour invite rape. Even in Sweden, activists complain, rapes in which the women know their assailants go unprosecuted because the victims are not seen as “good girls.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Krishnan assailed the fact that the conviction rate for rape prosecutions in India has fallen from 46 per cent in 1971 to just 26 per cent today (which, it should be noted, is higher than the conviction rates in the United Kingdom, Sweden and the United States). Indeed, the fact that most rapes are committed by men who are known to the victim should “only make it easier to apprehend the rapist.” Instead, women who go to the police are urged not to file a complaint. “Strange people will begin to assemble at the station out of nowhere to ‘explain' to you” why that advice is correct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem, Ms. Krishnan points out, starts at the top. In the midst of the protests, Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar sparked further outrage by suggesting that women carry chili powder to deter would-be rapists. And at a press conference, he said women shouldn't roam around without male escorts. Otherwise, whatever happens to them is their own fault.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with the protests continuing in the aftermath of the victim's death, officials are emphasizing the need for measures to guarantee the “safety and security” of women. But, as Ms. Krishnan notes, “the word ‘safety' with regard to women has been used far too much.” Indian women have heard it all their lives. “It means,” she says, “you behave yourself. You get back into the house. You don't dress in a particular way. Do not live by your freedom. … A whole range of patriarchal laws and institutions tell us what to do in the guise of keeping us ‘safe.' ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The six men accused of the bus attack have been arrested and charged with murder, and the government has ordered an inquiry into how rape cases are handled. But the government's critics remain skeptical of official intentions, noting that only 600 rapes a year are reported in the capital, despite the thousands that are estimated to occur annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deeper truth underlying the protests can be found on blogs, where young Indian men and women bemoan the fact that travel guidebooks routinely warn women about pervasive sexual harassment in India and advise them to move around in groups. Movies, religion, music and women themselves are all blamed for male sexual violence against women, but rapists are not held responsible. A “male-cosseting culture,” as one blogger put it, in turn supports a rape culture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The connection between rape, male privilege and female sexual vilification was one of the key insights of feminists in the 1970s – an insight they thought had been successfully applied to cultural debate about rape, and to law. In India – as in Italy, Sweden and elsewhere – women and men who support freedom of movement and safety from sex crimes are being forced to refight that battle. One hopes that the protests in India will inspire the West to emulate the protesters' lack of complacency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the developing world, women are in special jeopardy. Their embrace of autonomy and mobility risks putting them in conflict with a law-enforcement establishment and media that still view women through a pre-feminist lens: “Good girls” who stay at home should not be raped, while “bad girls” who stake a claim to public space are fair game.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eating an easy, comfortable meal after so much luxurious holiday foods is good for both body and soul. As I was growing up in Scotland, shepherd's pie was a weekly family meal, often extended with leftovers. Mince (ground meat) was a staple in Scottish households and it could be stretched in many different ways, including adding leftover cooked vegetables, beans and oatmeal. I still love a good shepherd's pie, although the simple and traditional carrot, onions and ground meat filling has morphed into something a little more interesting.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MUSHROOMS ON TOAST</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing tastes better to me than a sauté of garlicky mushrooms piled on good bread. Use as many different types of mushrooms as you can find and tear them up. The presentation looks great, but for a more sophisticated take use a puff-pastry base. Replace the whipping cream with Greek yogurt, if desired, but do not bring to a boil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Prep time: 20 minutes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Ready in: 35 minutes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Serves: 4</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4 slices pancetta</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHEPHERD'S PIE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shepherd's pie was originally a Scottish dish made with ground lamb, but I prefer the beef version. Although it can be made with leftover roast beef, it never has the same body or taste. When you're chopping the vegetables, try to make them all the same size (about ¼- to ½-inch dice) for even cooking and attractive appearance. Although the ingredient list looks long, this is a simple dish to make – and flavourful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Prep Time: 20 minutes</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comfort is the cue here, and that means just about any hearty red wine you love, because most would suit the mushroom-topped toasts as well as the shepherd's pie admirably. Top choices include gutsy Côtes du Rhône and fuller-bodied merlot or cabernet sauvignon. If you're on a tight budget to keep you off the post-holiday-spending fiscal cliff, try Italian Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, a steal at often less than $10.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's tempting to describe Lot No. 40 as one of the best Canadian whiskies I have ever tried. But I know what some of my wisecracking Scotch- and bourbon-obsessed friends would retort: “Best Canadian whisky, sure. But is it any good?”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such is the image our storied domestic spirit enjoys with many die-hard fans of single-malt and craft American spirits. Relatively light in body and designed with mixability in mind, Canadian whisky – most of it, anyway – is about as fashionable as Stephen Harper's haircut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, perhaps I should say it this way: Lot No. 40, priced at $39.90 in Ontario, is among the best new whiskies I tried in 2012, period. Launched by Corby in Ontario late last year and now rolling out to other provinces except Quebec, it's robust and multilayered, with bracing spice set against vanilla and toffee richness as well as chewy, raisin-like fruit. “This is a stunning whisky,” says Davin de Kergommeaux, author of the recently released Canadian Whisky: The Portable Expert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, save the Canada Dry for Silk Tassel or Canadian Mist; this is complex sipping whisky for a cozy winter's eve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be precise, it's not entirely new. The all-rye-grain spirit – a robust contrast to the sweet and mellow corn-heavy recipe favoured by Canadian whisky drinkers – was introduced about a decade ago. A limited supply was crafted by Corby's then master blender Mike Booth, who worked from a formula dating back seven generations to his Ontario ancestor Joshua Booth, a mill-owner and distiller. (The name is a tribute to the lot number near Kingston where Joshua kept his still.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guess what happened? The product flopped, buried in the dust of a consumer stampede toward high-end Scotch. Though it spawned some devotees, this writer among them, Corby pulled the plug.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was different from what the public was used to,” says Don Livermore, Corby's current master blender. “There is a bit of a rye renaissance going on, and the timing seems to be better for it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Canadian whisky has come to be synonymous with rye, most domestic offerings contain little, if any quantity, of that grain. We often refer to domestic brands as rye simply because the spicy ingredient was traditionally used as a minor flavouring, lending a piquant, dry character to the creamy, sweet essence of corn – like a dusting of pepper to a buttery cob.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But rye is in ascent, driven mainly by American distillers who are reviving, if in a small way, an ingredient that dominated U.S. whisky production in the 19th century. Back then, many U.S. distilleries were based in the Northeast, where hardy rye was plentiful. Sadly, Prohibition dealt a death blow to that industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also prompted a change in tastes, thanks in no small part to bootleg Canadian corn whisky that poured over the border into highball glasses filled with ginger ale and Coke. Following the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, Kentucky bourbon, also based on corn, became the go-to American spirit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I love rye. It's not only spicier than corn but also drier. And it's a nice alternative when I want a change, not just from bourbon and premium Canadian products like Gibson's Finest Rare 18-year-old, but from barley-based single-malt Scotches, with their nutty, smoky, cereal-like character.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fairness, rye has not been entirely absent in Canada. Alberta Distillers is the leading North American producer of 100-per-cent rye-grain whisky, far exceeding the total U.S. output. And its Alberta Premium 30-Year-Old and new Dark Horse are laudable examples. In Ontario, pioneering independent producer Forty Creek mixes a high proportion of rye with corn and barley to make a fabulous range of three-grain products, including the new Forty Creek Copper Pot Reserve. And Corby, which owns the Wiser's brand, recently introduced one of my other all-time favourite Canadian whiskies, Wiser's Legacy, a barley-heavy elixir containing 33-per-cent rye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Lot No. 40 has more going for it than rye. Unlike most Canadian whiskies, which are aged mainly in older, used barrels that have shed most of their oak essence, it's matured in a high proportion of new wood. That imparts a rich vanilla and toffee underpinning, sumptuously balancing the rye. Also in contrast to most Canadian whiskies, it's made one batch at a time in a copper-pot still, as with single-malt Scotch, rather than in a so-called continuous still. That technique helps preserve the fruity, floral notes generated by yeast during fermentation, which tend to be stripped out in continuous stills.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asking the TV critic to predict the new year is risky. We know the players, know their strengths and flaws, but so much is yet to be determined, so much is out of the hands of the players and the predictors.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In television, an auteur's show on premium cable might sink in self-indulgence. A strong new network show might get an awful time slot and be defeated by a competing series, same time, different network.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mind you, some patterns are clearly emerging, even as we look at mere lists of shows, the synopses, and their creators and stars. If we corral cable and network content together, what we see coming is a ton of toxic variations on the American nightmare of guns, killing and craziness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banshee, from the HBO-owned Cinemax (starts Jan. 11, HBO Canada) is set in a hallucinatory hell of corruption, crime, guns, death and sex. The fact that its producer is Alan Ball (Six Feet Under, True Blood) gave it advance notoriety, and it does deliver. It stars Antony Starr as Lucas Hood, an ex-con who assumes the identity of the sheriff of Banshee, Pa. Naturally, he becomes the king of the local criminals, while enemies from his distant past move in on him (and his ex, now a local married mom, played by former Bond girl Ivana Milicevic). “How can one town have so many scumbags?” is the line to remember from the first episode. Everything nasty happens in a heightened setting that is by turns cartoonish and menacingly real.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new, as-yet-unnamed Phil Spector biopic (HBO, date TBA) is obviously a big deal. David Mamet wrote it and Al Pacino stars as Spector, the legendary music producer and songwriter who was convicted of murder in 2009. It is mainly about that murder and the trial, and Spector's relationship with his lawyer, played by Helen Mirren.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bates Motel (A&amp;E, date TBA) is promoted as both a prequel to the events in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho and a “reimagining” of the characters. Certainly it's about the young Norman Bates (Freddie Highmore) and his relationship with his mom (Vera Farmiga, adding movie-star power to the series). At the same time, it appears to be set in a contemporary small town, not the era just before the story told in Psycho. What's available to see in advance is nicely creepy. All one has to hear is Norman saying “I love you, Mom” for the shivers to start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behind the Candelabra (HBO, date TBA) promises to be a blunt, adults-only treatment of the tempestuous relationship between Liberace (Michael Douglas) and his much younger lover, Scott Thorson (Matt Damon). Directed by Steven Soderbergh, it has compelled Damon to warn Liberace fans that the production will surely shock then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parade's End (HBO, date TBA) is an HBO/BBC production derived from the quartet of novels by Ford Madox Ford. A bittersweet, sometimes achingly painful story, it's really about a love triangle. A conservative English aristocrat (Benedict Cumberbatch, best known as Holmes on PBS's Sherlock) is torn between his brittle wife and a young suffragette.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Da Vinci's Demons (Starz, a Canadian channel TBA, spring 2013) is “the secret history of Leonardo da Vinci's tantalizing life.” We're told as well that da Vinci “throws himself into his genius and emerges as an unstoppable force that lifts an entire era out of darkness and propels it into light.” The show comes from David S. Goyer, co-writer of the Dark Knight Rises trilogy. Da Vinci the superhero is played by English actor Tom Riley and the series looks like The Borgias with less sex and more mysticism. Note that in its short life, Starz has already given us the great Boss and the very good Magic City series.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among returning series, Girls starts its second season Jan. 13 (HBO Canada). Season 2 of HBO's Enlightened – starring Laura Dern in her Golden Globe-winning role as a corporate exec who breaks down, only to become a guru of goodness – returns the same night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW AND NOTABLE ON THE NETWORKS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Following (Jan. 21, 9 p.m. Fox and CTV) is the hottest of the hot midseason series. Created by Kevin Williamson (The Scream movies, Dawson's Creek) it also has the potential to be the most controversial. A grim, gory psychological thriller, it stars Kevin Bacon as a deeply damaged ex-<span class="companylink">FBI</span> agent in a battle of wills with a charismatic serial killer (James Purefoy) who, it turns out, has legions of disciples who follow his orders. For network TV, it's unusually disturbing, graphic and bleak. Thematically, it's linked to Banshee and Bates Motel as part of an operatic obsession with violence and a barbarous undertow in U.S. culture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do No Harm (Jan. 31, NBC) is a twist on the Jekyll-and-Hyde story. The main character, a neurosurgeon named Jason Cole (Steven Pasquale) suffers from dissociative identity disorder, and the drug that suppresses his dark side is wearing off. His alter ego, Ian, is a nasty, unrepentant jerk. The theme of underlying, violent craziness continues here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hannibal (NBC, date TBA) goes back to Thomas Harris's novels about serial killer Hannibal Lecter (played here by Mads Mikkelsen) to finesse the drama of the killer's mind and methods. An <span class="companylink">FBI</span> criminal profiler (Hugh Dancy) feels he can learn from Lecter, who is also screwing with the mind of a therapist (Gillian Anderson from X-Files). Thematically: ditto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cracked (Jan. 8, CBC) stars David Sutcliffe (Gilmore Girls, Private Practice) as Detective Aidan Black, a tough Toronto cop dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder, often poorly, while assigned to a unit dealing mainly with mental illnesses. He's got a psychiatrist/cop (Stefanie von Pfetten) as a partner. On the early evidence, Cracked is so deeply conventional and well-meaning, its only perversity is its blandness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Motive (Feb. 3, CTV) is the other Canadian crime drama, but this one has buzz. Set in Vancouver, it promises a twist on the conventional procedural, with the viewer knowing way more than the characters. The lead cop – described by CTV as “a feisty female Vancouver homicide detective” – is played by Kristin Lehman.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year ended with an unforgivable brain-cramp mistake. User fees were indeed implemented in Saskatchewan three years after the introduction of medicare in 1962 – but by the Liberal government of Ross Thatcher, not by the CCF. The CCF paid for medicare, in part, with premiums but not user fees. Those fees were subsequently abolished by an NDP government, never to return to Saskatchewan nor to appear anywhere else in Canada. And, by the way, an admirer of former Saskatchewan premier T.C. Douglas wrote to say that the philatelic service had indeed issued a stamp honouring him, in contrast to what was written here. Good on Canada Post.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apologies, too, to the Harper government. In 2008, its platform promised to develop a “North American-wide cap-and-trade system.” It never pledged to implement a Canada-only system for greenhouse-gas emissions, and thus wasn't as hypocritical as was suggested in deriding the NDP's commitment to implement one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking of the Harper Conservatives, it was said here that, last summer, the Prime Minister would shake up his cabinet. Wrong. He left things intact in 2012. We'll see if he plays with a pat hand in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last June, these words appeared: “Canada is about to be spurned in its efforts to join the emerging trade bloc, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.” These words were spectacularly wrong. Canada did join the TPP talks, albeit belatedly and largely because the United States wanted Canada present (to get some things out of this country) and steamrollered the opposition of New Zealand and Australia. Now that Canada's in the TPP, how does it also find the resources and commitment to negotiate deals with India, South Korea and Thailand while considering China's grand offer to negotiate a free-trade deal?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A column about the federal budget in March, written as these things are in the budget lockup, was wrong in saying the “Conservatives essentially left the entire structure of the government intact,” evidence of a tendency of conservatives in North America to talk more about reducing the size of government than doing it. In fact, the Harper government is cutting $4-billion to $5-billion in Ottawa's own spending, eliminating programs, reducing others and ending the jobs of thousands of civil servants. These cuts are dressed up in Harperspeak as “administrative efficiencies,” whereas they're very real reductions in programs and jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shawn Atleo, national chief of the <span class="companylink">Assembly of First Nations</span>, wasn't “seriously challenged” at his organization's convention in July, as prophesied here. He won re-election easily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The erroneous prediction about Mr. Atleo's future came some months after another goof: that Bob Rae was so obviously the best qualified candidate to become the federal Liberal leader that “frankly, there is no one else. If there were, Mr. Rae could leave.” Well, there wasn't and there isn't. Yet, Mr. Rae still announced he wouldn't seek the leadership. The next sentence compounded the error: “Liberals can dream of Justin Trudeau, except that he has ruled out a leadership bid.” That's what Mr. Trudeau said, but obviously circumstances changed. So did his mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A column in February drew attention to the munificence of Alberta government spending, propped up by a staggering $15.9-billion in non-renewable energy revenues. A few weeks ago, the provincial treasurer warned of tough times ahead and pushed back his target for a balanced budget because non-renewable energy revenues were weak. How things change within a year, even for the country's wealthiest province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When will Alberta's political culture realize that the province needs a sales tax, which provides much steadier revenue to finance its expensive public services and would allow it to put much more of its non-renewable resources into the Heritage Fund? Answer to this rhetorical question: not any time soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A column in June waxed eloquent about New Brunswick's plan, negotiated with provincial unions, to eliminate fixed indexing and bring about other changes to make it sustainable. On reflection, those changes likely didn't go far enough, or at least don't provide the right template for other public institutions facing obligations they can't meet without higher contribution rates from employees.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years the perceived dominance of Ontario in Canadian federalism – along with Quebec's quest for sovereignty – was a recipe for Western alienation. But a new study suggests that Albertans now feel their province is getting the respect it deserves. The shift is dramatic, and it is a welcome recognition that the economic power of Alberta is being embraced by the creaky institutions of Canadian federalism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hand-in-hand with this, of course, is a growth of dissatisfaction elsewhere, particularly Quebec and the Maritimes, as they register a decline in their influence.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most interesting finding relates to Alberta. In the last provincial election, the opposition Wildrose Party tried to stoke the culture of grievance. It is a strategy that might well have worked before, but this time it failed to connect with voters. The plaintive cry of the past, ‘The West Wants In,” has a lot less resonance with people when the West is in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It makes sense: As Alberta's political and economic influence has grown, its sense of grievance has diminished. The study found that 61 per cent of Albertans feel their province is treated with the respect it deserves, compared with 38 per cent in 2003. What has changed in the interim? An Albertan-led Conservative government in Ottawa, for one thing. But it likely is more than politics alone. It's a lot more difficult to quantify, but there has been an attitudinal change toward Alberta elsewhere in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond Alberta, the findings portray a quite different picture. Sixty-eight per cent of Ontarians say their province is treated respectfully, down from 74 per cent in 2003, reflecting a decline in the province's economic dominance. In Quebec, just 35 per cent feel the province is treated respectfully, and in the Maritimes, 37 per cent. The Quebec result, especially, should concern the federal government as it could serve to feed the governing PQ's agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Provinces are so diverse in their geography, population and resources, and any effort to effect redistribution will likely create some degree of dissatisfaction,” notes Jack Jedwab, executive director of the Association for Canadian Studies. Leger Marketing conducted the poll of 2,200 Canadians last month on behalf of the ACS; the margin of error is 2.9 per cent 19 times out of 20.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No region in Canada is ever wholly content. That may not be a bad thing. Most people still prefer a federalist model to any other.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're talking about resolutions all this week, and since it's “food” day here in the Life section, let's talk about food and its beloved companion, booze.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Booze first: L. Rust Hills, in his classic tome of curmudgeonliness, How to Do Things Right, says, “the problem with most advice you get about … drinking is it comes from the wrong people…. People who couldn't handle booze at all are always trying to tell you you have to give it up entirely.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, as the long-time Esquire fiction editor says, “their solution is worse than your problem.” I tend to agree. For me, moderation is key – mostly because I never want to have to quit. Sit with the wife at the end of a long day and sip cranberry juice – or double Scotch on the rocks? Have to say I prefer the latter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, I understand there are those for whom moderation is simply not an option. I recall seeing CNN's Piers Morgan interview Rob Lowe, who's been clean and sober for more than 20 years, ever since blowing out on booze and coke and whatever else he could get his hands on as a teen movie star. At one point, Morgan says: “Don't you miss – what I would miss would be just having a nice glass of wine with a bowl of pasta.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Lowe says: “Why would anyone have a [single] glass of wine? Why bother? That's how you know … you're one of us. If I have a glass of wine, inevitably it's two glasses … and it's like: It just begins.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I definitely have that gene. I'm like Lowe (except without the looks, fame, cash or sobriety). One glass of wine just makes me thirsty. That's why I have to keep it in a box (my thirst, not the wine). So this year, I reaffirm my commitment to moderation: Just have one or two, and instead of “it begins,” it ends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's funny Morgan should have mentioned pasta. Food-wise, that's my biggest bête noire. This last year I've tried a couple of “low-carb” diets, including the “paleo” diet (eat like a pre-agrarian caveman, no grains, no gluten), and that was fun for a while, and I definitely felt the benefits….</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then a heaping, steaming plate of spaghetti carbonara (which even has “carb” in its name) will float into my imagination, I'll head to the stove (I always have the simple ingredients required for a carbonara – pasta, pancetta, egg, cheese – on hand) and that'll be that: total diet derailment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this year, I'm going to view these lapses as merely temporary, and after scarfing my carbonara, return virtuously to my palm-sized protein and heaping helping of steamed veggies the next day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I have to have a carbonara once in a while, otherwise, in the words of Rob Lowe: “Why bother?”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington's epic battle over the “fiscal cliff” would be tragic if it weren't so pathetic. It reminds me of a cartoon in which the duelling combatants hurl themselves off the precipice and keep fighting until they look down and go splat.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Republicans and Democrats are desperately hoping that cartoon physics applies to them, too. So long as they deny reality, they won't go splat – or so they hope. This week's alleged “deal” simply postponed the inevitable day of reckoning. And it confirmed that the American people's vast contempt for their legislators is richly deserved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is the U.S. finished? It's awfully tempting to think so. Political dysfunction, crushing debt, a bad economy and a sinking middle class are not exactly signs of vigour. Two failed wars have dealt huge blows to its reputation and prestige. Not to mention the gun culture and the junk food and the [fill in your favourite example of American pathology here].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the U.S. were a stock, I'd buy it. Despite the gloomy news, its future is looking brighter than it has in years. One reason is the new energy revolution, a phenomenal reversal of fortune that nobody foresaw. The country is awash in cheap new supplies of unconventional oil and gas that are being unlocked with new technologies. This unexpected bonanza is rocket fuel for the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also creating millions of new jobs – not McJobs but the kind of well-paid industrial ones that are supposed to have disappeared forever. “These jobs include people working on rigs in Pennsylvania or North Dakota, manufacturing equipment in Ohio or Illinois, and providing information-technology services in California or legal services to royalty owners nationwide,” energy expert Daniel Yergin wrote in The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The energy jobs of the future were supposed to be green. But it turns out they're brown. In case you think that's a bad thing, here's good news: Greenhouse-gas emissions have plummeted as clean natural gas replaces dirty coal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheap, reliable, abundant energy is helping to fuel another big trend – reshoring, the opposite of offshoring. The China advantage is disappearing fast, and the U.S. is on the verge of a manufacturing renaissance. A recent report by the <span class="companylink">Boston Consulting Group</span> (Made in America, Again) concludes: “Within five years, rising Chinese wages, higher U.S. productivity, a weaker dollar, and other factors will virtually close the cost gap between the U.S. and China for many goods consumed in North America.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dozens of leading U.S. companies have already set up new operations back home. It's even possible that your next computer will be made in America. Last month, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company will start making one of its new computer lines in California. “There are skills associated with manufacturing which have left the U.S.,” he told NBC, and he wants to see “a concerted effort” to get them back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conventional wisdom says the sun is setting on America's reign as the world's only superpower. Maybe so. But this sun will be setting for a long, long time. U.S. economic and military power remain unparalleled. It has the most inventive, entrepreneurial and open culture the world has ever seen, with the greatest concentrations of research and brainpower. It has the ability to recruit the best talent from around the globe. Sure, it has problems. But who doesn't? Would you rather put your bet on Europe? Or China, whose ruling class of kleptocrats and their spoiled Ferrari-driving offspring are facing a combustible mix of labour and peasant revolts on top of a demographic crisis? No thanks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the U.S. National Intelligence Council painted a picture of the global mega-trends that will shape the world between now and 2030. These include food, resource and water shortages, and wrenching technological change. But the answer to the question “Is America finished?” is a resounding No. Although the U.S. will have to share the power, it will remain “first among equals” for years to come. “No other power would be likely to achieve the same panoply of power in this time frame under any plausible scenario.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">America is much more than the sum of its cartoonish politics – luckily for Americans, and for us.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, unsatisfactory as it is to all concerned, is nonetheless a genuine compromise between the Obama administration and the Republicans in Congress. A policy-induced recession may have been avoided, but there has been little or no progress toward greater responsibility on the spending front. Worse, the possibility of a default by the United States government in March persists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the temporary tax reductions enacted by the George W. Bush administration have now been made permanent, but the Republicans did not obtain much of the expenditure cuts they had demanded, especially on “entitlements,” that is, on certain health-care, retirement and social programs.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relative lack of attention to the payroll tax, both from the White House and the Republicans, is notable. The Republicans fought to prevent income-tax increases for earners of high incomes, with considerable success. There was much less interest in the reversal of one stimulative measure; Congress let payroll tax rise back from 4.2 per cent to 6.2 per cent. That will tend to reduce aggregate demand, at a time of slow growth, and diminish the after-tax income of earners of salaries and wages: most of the middle class, in any realistic sense of that term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration, for its part, was evidently content to add back in that two-percentage-point difference, in order to protect the solvency of the Social Security Trust Fund – though that entitlement-providing fund exists only notionally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the sound and fury, and the partisan bitterness, lurks some degree of consensus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the only redeeming element of this episode is that the Senate has shown itself capable of arriving at a broad-based agreement. The House of Representatives was not quite willing to fly in the face of a large majority of the Senate. It remains to be seen whether the American political system can handle the next such crisis, in March, on the so-called debt ceiling.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a time, growing up, when I suggested to my mother I might want to be a priest.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This no doubt made her smile. My mother believed there wasn't a problem in the world that a Hail Mary couldn't solve. Our family never set out on a road trip without everyone in the car being forced to say the Act of Contrition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christ looked down on me and my four siblings from crosses that hung throughout our house. Our baptisms were as big a deal as bar mitzvahs. For years while attending St. Joseph's Catholic Elementary in Sarnia, I'd get up early so I could help our local priest celebrate mass. I wasn't the greatest altar boy in the world, but I was dependable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once when the priest was reciting Latin while washing his hands from a bowl I was holding, I thought he was mumbling instructions in English to me instead. “I'm sorry, Father,” I kept repeating. “But I don't understand what you're saying.” I'm lucky I wasn't fired on the spot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, I gave up the altar boy gig. Once I got to our Catholic high school, I wasn't attending Sunday mass regularly, either. By university, I'd pretty much stopped going altogether. Over the next few years, I'd make an exception around Christmas, but, in due course, I didn't even go then. Many of the friends I grew up with would fade away from the church in much the same manner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the church wants us back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Archdiocese of Vancouver has become the first in Canada to participate in a controversial campaign to get lost members of the flock to return home. Catholics Come Home, Inc. is an American-based organization that began the crusade to convince lapsed churchgoers that the pews they once filled waited for them without judgment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Vancouver, the archdiocese has been running Catholics Come Home television ads at a cost of about $500,000. There are three of them: one that promotes the many good things the church has been responsible for (hospitals, orphanages, schools); one that amounts to a testimonial by those who have returned to the church and found happiness; and one, if I might sum it up, that suggests people who have led a life of sin may want to reconcile with their maker just in case their checkout date arrives unexpectedly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's this ad, in particular, I could see enjoying some success in exploiting that sense of guilt and fear that Catholics, lapsed or otherwise, carry with them a lifetime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I would estimate one-quarter million baptized Catholics among us [in the archdiocese] are no longer practising their faith with any regularity,” Vancouver Archbishop Michael Miller was quoted in The Vancouver Sun as saying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if the archbishop could get even 10 per cent of those who have abandoned the church to return, that's nearly 25,000 new(ish) parishioners and a far heavier collection plate. And you'd certainly have to think that declining revenue is playing some sort of role in this membership drive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fact is, it's not just numbers in the Catholic Church that are down but those in most organized religions, even ones with a far more liberal-minded orthodoxy than the comparably strict tenets overseen by the Pope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We live in a far more secularized world than we once did, particularly in North America. British Columbia is especially notorious for the great numbers of resident non-believers. For years, the Vatican has tried to put a finger on why people who were baptized in the church have left. There's no simple answer. But there are plenty of reasons that Rome has stubbornly refused to acknowledge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many people, the church is simply not relevant to their lives. They find Catholicism, and its teachings, desperately out of sync with the times. The church's uncompromising stand on abortion, homosexuality, contraception and divorce, among other issues, has alienated millions of churchgoers. The rise of busy dual-income families has also eroded church attendance. And we haven't even mentioned the incalculable damage abuse scandals have done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wish the Vancouver archdiocese well in its recruitment efforts. But I also sympathize with those who have left their Catholic past behind because they've become more spiritual than religious and because they can no longer align themselves with an institution whose ideology, on many fronts, is in such conflict with their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All these years later, I think of my Catholic upbringing and imagine a priest speaking a language I don't understand.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One good idea for a home-based resolution for me would definitely be: Get more organized. Especially if you saw my closet – I have to dig through piles of shirts to find shoes, and vice versa – you might agree that'd be the place to start.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another one could be: Start a modest garden. Just some herbs and stuff. When you buy herbs, you use some, the rest turn black; whereas if you grow them, you snip a few off, and they grow back. Surely even I, the least agriculturally inclined person on the planet, could keep a little, say, rosemary bush alive for a while. (Though if you saw the forlorn state of our lone potted plant, an aloe vera – which as a form of cactus thrives on neglect, but not the level of neglect it receives around our house – you might be forgiven if you pronounced this little venture doomed.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But my true New Year's resolution with respect to home is: Make sure my house truly is one, by spending more time with my family, especially my three boys. (I already do spend a fair amount of time sitting around chatting with my wife; I'm not sure she could take any more, to be honest, and might even be wishing for a bit less.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I need to make a point of tearing myself away from my computer, and them from their various electronic devices, sitting them down in (say) the living room, in front of (ideally) a nice crackling fire, and performing some shared, non-digital, analog activity with them. Nothing says fun like a rousing round of crokinole or pinochle, right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">True, the boys might squawk at first being dragged up from their basement dungeon where they play endless rounds of “first-person shooter” games, Mindcraft (which should be called Mindbend from what I've seen), and watching Family Guy on Netflix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it'll be good for them, and for me, and they'll have fun in the end. They always do. I didn't do that enough last year. Chasing my career so single-mindedly, trying to (help) make sure those mortgage payments got made, I think I forgot a bit about what a house really is: a place to spend time with family and friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How will I remember to do this as the year unfolds? Maybe a few simple mnemonics, like: Every time I look my oldest son in the eye – he's almost as tall as I am now – recall how quickly time has passed since he was a baby, and how quickly it's going. Then glance at the tattoo on my arm (of a strawberry milkshake) that says “seize the day,” and make sure I always do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You too, dear readers. I'm not saying get a tattoo. But bear in mind: Time munches on, gnashing our lives in its masticating mandibles. This year, let's all remember to try to seize every day and hang on tight.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unsurprising statistics from the United States: The number of self-published books published in that country annually, both print and e-books, has grown 287 per cent since 2006. That makes close to 250,000 self-published titles a year out there. These statistics were gathered by the company that oversees ISBNs (international standard book numbers) in the U.S.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I haven't found equivalent stats for Canada, but common sense says the trend is true for all countries. Never before in history has there been more available to read. That idea makes some people excited – for surely somewhere swirling in this frothy swelling surf is revolutionary insight that may not have ever taken shape in more hierarchical systems – and left others feeling strangely uneasy about the rising flood of words, most of them banal, far too many to ever be read or even adequately curated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One would think that the vast majority of these new titles are e-books, but that isn't the case. Print books still make up 63 per cent of these self-published titles, although the e-book percentage is mounting dramatically every year. The majority of all self-published books, both print and electronic, are created with the help of large companies (<span class="companylink">Smashwords</span>, CreateSpace, <span class="companylink">Author Solutions</span>) that sell publishing services to authors. In other words, the market for these books is not you or me, the general public; the market is the authors themselves. Once the book is in existence, virtual or otherwise, it's up to the author to distribute and promote it, and that's exactly where most of these projects stall and languish – in that great silent forest of falling trees, cyberspace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course all the companies involved in this business like to point out how many self-published books have somehow attracted mass audiences and made it to The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> bestseller lists. The Joy of Cooking, Chicken Soup for the Soul, The Celestine Prophecy, Fifty Shades of Grey … these are the great flashing beacons of hope for every net-forum fan-fiction writer in the world. Of course those cases are so rare as to be statistically negligible, but hope in art is a kind of religion; it survives through irrational faith alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What effect does this massive outpouring of expression and opinion have on literary culture, and on the world of ideas generally? The moderns are thrilled at the new democracy of ideas and the loosening of restraints on what is considered literature. They love the idea that the strictly formulaic sub-genres of fantasy fiction are pleasing a mass audience as pleasing a mass audience is exactly what the best art should do. They love the fact that teenagers have cultivated their own online free publishing networks for the kinds of stories that teenagers like. They point to popular music and the great word-of-mouth successes of bands without major labels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also point to the great thinkers of history and what subversive methods they have had to use to release radical or unpopular ideas into conservative atmospheres. Here's just one of many famous examples: An American statistician called Edward Tufte revolutionized the new field of information design with a book called The Visual Display of Quantitative Information – a book that was turned down by major presses and self-published by Tufte in 1982. He took out a second mortgage on his home to do so. The book is now the bible of the discipline. How many Edward Tuftes were silenced by cautious publishers in that era, and how many more original ideas will be buoyed to the surface by the instantaneously international word-of-mouth that the Internet now provides? We can only benefit from more, from more of everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ancients are simply weary of self-expression, suffering from ennui perhaps, queasy at the notion of more of everything, especially more of the mundane – more books that are extended status updates, more fantasy genres with codified rules, more pseudo-Buddhist self-help – and queasy at the notion of yet more teenager influence on the culture at large. And they are skeptical of the economic benefits of a giant self-publishing industry with no readers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a jaded stance: One does not have to read or even see anything one doesn't want to.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's start this year with a rant.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason for the rant is this: Sometimes it's not television that can drive you around the bend and up the wall, it's the people who deliver it to you. Oh sure, some people get disgusted by such things as the preponderance of American rednecks behaving badly on reality TV. (There's more coming tonight, just stick with me here for details to enliven your disgust.) So disgusted, actually, that I reckon there will soon be angry protests in the streets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rednecks and rambunctious people – that's nothing. At least you can turn them off. There are worse experiences. Allow me to explain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Christmas morning I arose with a face that would stop a clock. Or, as my dear mother would call it, a face like the Antichrist. The previous evening the on-screen guide had disappeared from my TV service, which is provided by the brigands known as Rogers. No guide. No information. “No data available,” it said for every show and every channel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not a tragedy. I know that. Nobody starved to death. But it's a major problem. When this happens, as it had a couple of weeks before on a Friday at midnight, you have no idea what's on TV. You can't program the PVR to watch anything because there's no information. You're clueless. And, before you start that e-mail telling me how to live without cable TV, stop and remember that I need this service to do my job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What was especially aggravating on this occasion was that on the same day the on-screen guide disappeared, there arrived in the mail a notice from Rogers about upcoming increases in charges for various channels and services. Now, my cable-TV bill is already enormous. And here's Rogers telling me it will cost more. Simultaneously, Rogers removes the on-screen guide. On Christmas Eve, no less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time passed and eventually I was able to speak to someone at Rogers. The gist of the lady's explanation was, “Oh jeez, I dunno how that happened. That's strange.” She offered to send a new guide directly to the digital box. When I turned on the TV again, it would be there. No, it wasn't. Then she transferred me to the technical department, the one that would surely help. Time passed. While on hold, I heard a notice to customers – Rogers was having problems with the on-screen guide and we should all be aware of this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More time passed and when the smell of my burning dinner began emanating from the stove, I gave up. Christmas ruined. For days, the on-screen guide returned and disappeared. Returned and disappeared. I spent more time turning the damn digital box thing on and off than I did doing Christmasy things. And these people have the nerve to announce higher fees. If you want expert knowledge of ways to create a special kind of hell, Rogers are the people to consult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the subject of special kinds of hell, say hello to Buckwild (MTV Canada, 10 p.m.), which is set in Sissonville, W.V. It's “a place founded on freedom,” we are informed. By that, the speaker, a 19-year-old, means the freedom to party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sissonville is hill country, apparently. There's only one way in and one route out. As a youth astutely informs us, “Law ain't gonna come up here and get us.” And he continues, “We're young, free and buck wild.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeedy. The series, MTV's screw-you replacement for Jersey Shore, furthers the trend of seeking spectacle and authentic sass among hillbillies and rednecks. The gaggle of youths featured here are Honey Boo Boo's crazy cousins. They are kin to the people on Duck Dynasty, who would shake their heads and pronounce that y'all need to drink less when y'all get in your trucks and go splashing in the mud yelling “yee-haw!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First we meet Ashley, age 19, and, as she says, “known for trouble.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm a good kid, don't get me wrong,” Ashley says plaintively. Then we see footage of Ashley while she's mud-wrestling, her ample and escaping bosom being gripped by some guy's feet. Ah, youth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among her pals is Anna, who declares, “I'm a really chill girl but I've been known to get into fights.” As it turns out, Anna is famous for launching herself at another girl's hair. Joey, another 19-year-old, also has hair issues. He's pretty certain the ladies love his hair. Joey also informs viewers of a core truth about life in Sissonville: “Around here, man's only as good as his truck.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The profundity continues. A gal tells some guy who has said she looks “real good” to quit hitting on her. He denies it: “I ain't hitting on ya. If I was hitting on ya, I'd have a bottle of liquor in my hand.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buckwild is just another MTV show about footloose, obnoxious youths frolicking. Annoyance at it is redundant. It didn't ruin my Christmas. Me, I like the style and attitude of these kids. I'd like to sic them on the people at Rogers Cable for a day.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gun rights have been trumping free speech and open inquiry in the United States. Florida went so far as to pass a law barring family doctors from discussing gun safety in many situations with their patients – the type of discussion that might have prevented the massacre of 20 children and six adults at a Connecticut elementary school last month. And Congress has put limits on the funding of gun-related injury research, effectively discouraging the <span class="companylink">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</span> and the <span class="companylink">National Institutes of Health</span>, the country's key agency for delivering grants to researchers, from paying for these much-needed studies.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should be no surprise, then, that gun controls have become looser, that the National Rifle Association's influence has steadily grown and that some bizarre and dangerous pro-gun laws have been passed in a majority of states. In Vermont, 16-year-olds may carry a hidden handgun without a permit or parental permission. In 35 states, people may carry guns openly, and without a permit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the public outpouring about children's safety at school, after the Connecticut massacre, the issue of child safety at home and in the streets may be obscured. In 2009, 114 children and teens were killed in accidents with guns, according to the <span class="companylink">American Academy of Pediatrics</span>. A national survey in 2011 reported that 8.6 per cent of high-school boys – one in every 12 – said they had carried a gun in the previous month. Guns are one of the top three causes of death in youth in the United States – a national shame about which the U.S. has grown complacent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so many children and teens dying unnecessarily, the state is knowingly contributing to the risk of death by imposing silence on doctors, as it did in Florida, at least until a judge barred its enforcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's a much bigger battle to be waged, according to two doctors writing in the latest issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. In 1997, Congress told the CDC that “none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control” could be used “to advocate or promote gun control.” Research stopped. In 2009, after federally funded research was published on whether carrying a gun increases or decreases the risk of being assaulted by a firearm, Congress extended its restrictions from the CDC to all federal health-related agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Second Amendment (the right to bear arms) trumps the First Amendment (freedom of speech), and when the notion of “gun owners' privacy rights” is more important than child safety, one can conclude only that logic and good sense are being turned upside down.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians are taking the federal government's warning about possible economic storm clouds in 2013 to heart, as a new poll shows growing uncertainty over whether Canada is still on the right track.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The poll by Nanos Research, in collaboration with the Institute for Research on Public Policy, shows a worrying leap in the number of Canadians who answered “unsure” when asked whether “Canada, as a country, is moving in the right direction or the wrong direction.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It speaks to a potential malaise,” pollster Nik Nanos warned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When people were asked the same question a year ago, 64 per cent were convinced Canada was heading in the right direction, and 28 per cent were certain it was heading in the wrong direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, while the wrong-direction number was virtually unchanged at 27 per cent, the right-direction number had plummeted to 48 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who were “not sure” in which direction the country was heading had correspondingly increased from 9 per cent in 2011 to 25 per cent in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When the Minister of Finance repeatedly sends out warnings to Canadians about household debt, and when people hear the news around the world, it has an impact,” Mr. Nanos said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Finance Minister Jim Flaherty, along with Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney, have been repeatedly warning Canadians that their level of personal debt is too high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harper was at it again in an interview that aired just before Christmas on Global Television.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Many households are well within a comfort level but some have been pushing the envelope and we obviously urge them to be cautious,” he told interviewer Dawna Friesen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Because eventually, interest rates will go up. You should be asking yourself, ‘If interest rates were a couple of points higher, can I really afford the debt load I'm taking on now?' ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nanos believes that Canadians are taking these warnings to heart. But there is the danger that expectations could influence reality. If people become sufficiently worried about looming interest-rate hikes, or that Canada will be dragged into another recession, then they may save money so aggressively that they produce the very economic downturn they fear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nanos believes the government should consider the poll “a bit of warning. If you keep talking up caution, at some point it becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conservatives appear prepared to take that risk. Better a gradual slowdown in growth as consumers de-leverage, Mr. Flaherty believes, than rafts of foreclosed mortgages and plunging property values as interest rates rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most economists believe the government is generally balancing risks in its messages. As TD Economics head Craig Alexander told The Globe recently, the balance of probabilities continues to favour moderate growth, low interest rates and low inflation throughout 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may reassure the many Canadians who are increasingly unsure where this country is headed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">************</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Golf watchers can be certain the new <span class="companylink">PGA</span> Tour season that starts Friday with the Hyundai Tournament of Champions in Kapalua, Hawaii, will be full of controversy and intrigue. Above all, there's the delicate matter of anchoring a putter against one's chest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">United States Golf Association</span> and the Royal &amp; Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews announced in late November that as of Jan. 1, 2016, it will be illegal to anchor a putter that way. On Wednesday, Carl Pettersson referred to the movement against the long putter as a “witch hunt,” saying that golf's governing bodies are overreacting to three of the last five major champions having employed one.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It seems silly to ban something that's been around for 40 years,” said Pettersson, who qualified for Kapalua by winning at Hilton Head. “It's unfortunate. I feel like I'm 16 years behind because I haven't putted with anything else for 16 years. … They keep harping on the younger generation using them, but I think they're going to ban it because it looks bad. But you have strong arguments from other players, too.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tiger Woods, Steve Stricker and Graeme McDowell are among those who have spoken against the anchored stroke, in the belief that it takes the skill out of putting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keegan Bradley, who used a long putter to win the 2011 <span class="companylink">PGA</span> Championship, said he will do everything he can to protect himself and his fellow players, though he stopped short of threatening legal action. Ernie Els anchored his putter when he won the British Open in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Webb Simpson, the 2012 U.S. Open champion, anchors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">PGA</span> Tour could ban the long putter prior to 2016, and has said it will address the issue during a player meeting Jan. 22 at the <span class="companylink">Farmers Insurance</span> Open in La Jolla, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I know it's a touchy subject,” said Bradley, who's playing this weekend. “I would prefer for it to go three years so we aren't rushed into it. I think that would be the fair way to do it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the R&amp;A, itself a men-only club, will be in the spotlight when the British Open returns in July to the men-only Muirfield Golf Club in Gullane, Scotland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The issue will be on the front burner because Augusta National Golf Club, which long restricted its membership to men only, invited former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice and South Carolina businesswoman Darla Moore to join the club.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also the issue of how far players are hitting the ball, and the USGA's and R&amp;A's reluctance to deal with it. So many classic courses have been rendered obsolete for modern tournament golf because they're too short.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The USGA will be in the hot seat when players return to the Merion Golf Club in June for the U.S. Open. The U.S. Open hasn't been played there since 1971, when the course was about 6,500 yards. It will play less than 7,000 yards, short by today's standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's concern already that the USGA has altered the course via fairway contouring and other means to make Merion look and play in strange ways.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bitter debate over the Northern <span class="companylink">Gateway</span> oil pipeline project shows Canadian policy-making at its worst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A piece of nationally significant infrastructure, the project is currently mired in a toxic mess, assailed by environmentalists, targeted by vote-hungry B.C. politicians and publicly challenged by many first nations. You could be forgiven for feeling a dreadful sense of déjà vu.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1970s, an ambitious plan was mooted for a natural gas pipeline down the Mackenzie Valley. Aboriginal people and environmentalists protested. Justice Thomas Berger was named to head an inquiry that galvanized opposition to the pipeline, recommending that it be delayed until aboriginal people were ready to participate fully.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, companies created new aboriginal partnership models. Aboriginal communities and governments grew more familiar with the project and innovated by becoming equity partners. While some opposition remained, most in the region supported a pipeline that promised jobs for the North and revenue for aboriginal governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in an object lesson in the perishable nature of opportunity, by the time the project was finally approved, northern gas was no longer competitive with low-cost shale gas closer to markets. The opportunity now appears lost for a generation. If we don't want the same to happen in our efforts to get Canadian oil to the West Coast, we need to learn the lessons of the Mackenzie Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Inuvialuit (Inuit of the Western Arctic) and the first nations of the Mackenzie Valley, the pipeline was an unprecedented opportunity. The combination of the pipeline, modern treaties and self-government held out the prospect of overcoming generations of paternalism and poverty. Equity investment in the pipeline, secure revenue and local jobs were precisely the solutions aboriginal people sought to their problems. Delay put paid to those opportunities for decades to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar situation is unfolding along the Northern <span class="companylink">Gateway</span> route. The opportunity is huge. As Justice Berger said in his inquiry's final report, location is a natural resource. Northern British Columbia's location matters because our oil is more valuable if we can get it to energy-hungry Asian markets. And Northern B.C. is the logical route to tidewater. But unless we respect and build on aboriginal aspirations, the fate of the Mackenzie Valley beckons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Numerous options are being floated: rail to the West Coast, a new railway through Yukon to Alaska, the reversal of existing pipelines to Eastern Canada and more. None are as timely, efficient or market sensitive as the Northern B.C. route. For those not viscerally opposed to oil and pipelines, Northern <span class="companylink">Gateway</span> is the best answer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without first nations' willing participation, however, it's extremely unlikely to succeed. That's not a bad thing. First nations are deeply concerned about environmental risks; their engagement will help ensure the highest standards of safety, security and emergency responsiveness. They also know only too well that properly managed resource developments, including pipelines, offer the best solution to the employment and governance challenges they face. First nations have a judicially and politically recognized voice now in resource development, and they're using it with increasing effectiveness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent indication by the Haisla, on whose traditional territory the pipeline terminus would be built, that they're open to discussions is emblematic of the cautiously entrepreneurial yet environmentally sensitive approach that first nations are now taking. Enbridge and governments are facing tough bargainers all along the <span class="companylink">Gateway</span> route, as they should. But what's needed now is to find the right way to make aboriginal people full participants in development from the outset, not an interest group to be placated once plans have been made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The way to break the logjam on <span class="companylink">Gateway</span>, therefore, is to turn it from an outsiders' project resented by mistrustful first nations along the route into a full partnership between an industry with expertise and capital and newly empowered aboriginal people and governments. An aboriginal energy corridor across Northern B.C., for example, could be the conduit for all forms of energy seeking to flow across B.C. to Asian markets, and majority aboriginal ownership would give first nations the confidence, authority and incentives to embrace responsible development. Best of all, such a powerful equity position removes the seller's remorse that too often afflicts aboriginal agreement to resource development: As owners, they would participate fully in all the value created by their involvement and consent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mackenzie Valley pipeline's proponents had the right model: aboriginal equity and full participation by indigenous groups along the corridor. That project was delayed too long, and a vital opportunity was lost. Pipelines vital to Canada's ambition of being a world energy superpower are a fitting place to recognize that aboriginal people have arrived as a natural resource superpower in their own right within Canada. This is the shape of the resource industry in Canada's future.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sober second thought is always the first casualty whenever Canada suffers what, at first blush, appears to be a mortal wound on the international hockey stage, something that happened Thursday in faraway Ufa, Russia. After a nifty 4-0 run through the preliminary round, Canada's world juniors were resoundly defeated 5-1 by the United States in the semi-final and eliminated from gold-medal contention.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Immediately, the temptation was to turn that single result into a referendum on the state of hockey in Canada. It can't be that. It should never be that. One game – won or lost – does not a program make. Any team in any sport can lose a single game because that is the nature of competition. Teams that win Stanley Cup champions always lose multiple games en route to a championship. The whole point of playing a two-month tournament for the top prize in professional hockey is to eliminate the chance of coming up dead flat in a single game, the way Canada did against the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, a few thoughts on the specifics: If the Americans did one thing better than the Canadians, it was in the way they had their defencemen pinch up at every turn. In the first meeting between the teams, Canada did a good job of getting in on the fore-check, and forcing the Americans to retreat back into their own ends and play a 200-foot game. Not so this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. defenders, in particular the <span class="companylink">Buffalo Sabres</span>' draft choice Jake McCabe, were constantly up on the play. Remember how John Carlson scored the winner in OT against Canada three years ago, on the four-on-four rush? The sort of activation, you saw all game against the Canadians. It created all sorts of turnovers by the Canadians – in the defensive zone, or just outside the defensive zone – and pretty soon, all that pressure resulted in pucks past goaltender Malcolm Subban.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the matter of the tournament format, which keeps getting tweaked every so often and will get tweaked again next year when the bye into the semi-final is eliminated and every team will need to play in a quarter-final match. Once upon a time, the general rule of thumb was that an extra day's rest, which Canada earned by going undefeated early, was valuable because it permitted you to play a potentially tired team to open the medal round.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That theory has been proved wrong on multiple fronts, including the last great Canadian international victory – in Vancouver, at the Olympics – when playing an extra game because they finished second in the preliminary round (behind the United States) actually gave the Canadians more time to get their act together. It was the same with the Americans at this junior tournament, where they were a modest 1-2 out of the gate and couldn't buy a goal. But they managed to get it going against the Slovaks by scoring nine goals to qualify for the second round and once their offence got started, it just kept rolling – 21 goals in all during the last three games, seven of them by John Gaudreau, the <span class="companylink">Calgary Flames</span>' prospect who bears more than just a little resemblance to Joey Mullen, another pint-sized American who thrived in the pros.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No, on this day, in this venue, at that precise moment in time, the Americans were the better team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you want to speak rationally about player development, however, a better approach is to analyze the world junior tournaments held in NHL lockout years because that is the only time every country gets its best under-20 players together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada had Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, Mark Scheifele, Ryan Strome, Dougie Hamilton and others who wouldn't have been available this year if NHL play had started on time, in the same way it had Patrice Bergeron, Ryan Getzlaf, Corey Perry and Shea Weber in North Dakota (2005) and Jason Allison, Ryan Smyth and others in Red Deer (1995). Those three tournaments span three generations of players and until they lost to the Americans, Canada had been 18-0 in the years when its best available talent was actually at its disposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every year, there's someone new to get excited about and the creative and talented 17-year-old Jonathan Drouin was that player this year, even if he – like the rest of his teammates – came out flat in the semi-final. It was disappointing, yes. It was hard to see coming, yes. But it isn't the end of the world either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada won gold at this event in years past by benefiting from a little bit of puck luck. Other times, Canada lost gold when its opponents were a luckier. It's not much of a consolation maybe, but luck wasn't a factor in the equation this time. The Americans had the better game plan and they had the better execution as well. It happens in hockey and – news flash – as long as hockey continues to matter in the United States, Russia and Sweden, it'll happen again.</p>

Now a young Icelandic girl is challenging the state for the right to use her off-list given name. Sometimes it's hard to know which side to come down on.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 15-year-old girl in question was baptized Blaer by a priest who thought the name, which after all means “light breeze” in Icelandic, was an approved one. However, it's not on the list of 1,712 male names and 1,853 female names at the country's Personal Names Register; consequently, Blaer is referred to on all official documents as “Stulka,” which means “girl.” A panel that oversees the register has rejected the name on the grounds the noun it comes from takes a masculine article. It issued this decision in spite of the fact Blaer is the name of a female character in a novel by one of Iceland's most revered authors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ruling was made by the same panel that has approved Elvis as a child's name in Iceland. The girl and her mother are prepared to go to the country's supreme court in their fight. “It seems like a basic human right to be able to name your child what you want, especially if it doesn't harm your child in any way,” the mother is reported to have told the local media. That's all that needs to be said in this case. Blaer should be Blaer. Meanwhile, young Pilot Inspektor can take heart in the fact that, in countries that don't enforce government-approved monikers, changing one's name is a relatively simple matter.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Somewhat to my surprise, I find Public Safety Minister Vic Toews's adamancy that prisoners should be prohibited from occasionally ordering in pizzas or KFC dinners very disturbing. It brings to mind Ebenezer Scrooge and feels especially mean-spirited at this celebratory time of year. So what insights might we gain by focusing an ethics lens on this situation?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I studied criminology many years ago, we were taught there were three goals of sentencing: punishment, deterrence and rehabilitation.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The convicted offender is considered to deserve punishment, the major element of which is loss of freedom. Could Mr. Toews view ordering in pizza as the attribution of too much liberty?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Punishment of the offender is also meant to provide the victims and others hurt by the crime with some healing. This is mediated through a person in authority – the sentencing judge – recognizing on behalf of society the wrong done to the victims and imposing punishment. This also elicits the sense for victims and society as a whole that justice is being done. In looking at the wider role of punishment, keep in mind that the criminal justice system replaced individual revenge and was a development toward a more civilized society and, in some respects, a more humane one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some victims and others would passionately support Mr. Toews's anti-pizza stand, but then some of them would also support corporal and capital punishment, which doesn't justify these interventions. And we should remember that how we treat the most despised people in our society says much more about our ethics than theirs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ordering in pizza and enjoying it in a social setting is something many of us do from time to time. It brings to mind warm human contact, laughter, sharing and conversation. Might these associations disturb the “them” and “us” dichotomy used to stigmatize, depersonalize and dehumanize prisoners? Make it less easy for us to believe they're not us – and we're not them?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second goal of imprisonment is deterrence. Specific deterrence is directed at stopping that offender from offending again; general deterrence is aimed at convincing others that crime doesn't pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the occasional pizza, KFC or barbecue chicken, prison is not a resort, so it's difficult to see how either form of deterrence could be negatively affected by very limited and warden-approved access to these commodities, unless it's believed that deterrence requires the maximum of deprivation that's within the bounds of not inflicting cruel or unusual punishment, as prohibited by the Charter of Rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rehabilitation of the offender is the third goal of sentencing – and the one many people believe should take priority when there's conflict among achieving all of the goals. This choice of priority is not “going soft” on crime; rather, it's “going hard” on protecting society – precisely the goal of Mr. Toews's portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's been reported that, sometimes, the pizzas are for family visits, which are allowed in an effort to keep families intact. Creating settings in which prisoners can experience love and joy with their families or companionship with their fellow inmates is more likely than not to assist in their rehabilitation, and it's very difficult to imagine how this would do harm in this regard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, without turning privileges into rights, ethically and humanely, the balance is in favour of bringing in the occasional pizza and KFC meal.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either Canada has great hockey fans or people in this country aren't sleeping properly. Despite starting times in the middle of the night, TSN still saw respectable ratings from the round robin of the world junior championship in Ufa, Russia. Canada's game with Russia on New Year's Eve attracted 1.6 million for its 9 a.m. Eastern start (6 a.m. Pacific). A total of 2.5 million saw the game either live or in replay later.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Sunday game against the United States, which started at 4:30 a.m. EST, 561,000 watched live on TSN. A further 901,000 caught the encore at noon Eastern. Even the Boxing Day opener against Germany garnered 372,000 for a 4:30 a.m. EST start. Hello, Five-Hour Energy!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Healthy numbers, yes. But a far cry from the 2011 world juniors final in Buffalo between Canada and Russia. Canada lost to Russia 5-3, but TSN had an audience of 6.2 million viewers. RDS scored its second-highest audience for a world junior match with 652,000 viewers, despite Canada surrendering five goals in the third period to lose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 2012 tournament in Alberta, several round-robin games drew live audiences between 2.2 million and almost three million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The semi-final between Canada and Russia (won 6-5 by Russia) drew a robust 2.9 million. As a result, TSN won the ratings battle in Canada every night the whole week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brand loyalty</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So do TSN's modest numbers this year spell a weakening of the world juniors brand or are they simply a reflection of the time-zone crunch? “Think it's pure time zone,” says Brian Cooper, president and CEO of S&amp;E Sponsorship Group, which handles many Hockey Canada sponsors. “I'm a big hockey fan, but I'm not getting up at 4:30 to watch. The numbers are very respectable. When you average them over five years it is still a bargain.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While ratings are down and the tournament goes to Sweden next year, Cooper says that Hockey Canada's control of signage even in foreign countries is a plus for Canadian sponsors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For sponsors, you buy the branding through replays and highlight packs on TV, because Hockey Canada controls them. That gives you a chance to block out your competitor and get branding even at reduced viewership.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cooper also says the gold-medal drought is not a problem to sponsors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's a feeling Canada should win all the time. That used to happen. I thought that hurt the brand more than going a few years without winning.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cherry picking</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TV viewers have been seeing commercials for the latest iteration of Don Cherry's video dedicated to the manly arts in hockey. Let's just say Roger Ebert ain't reviewing this one either. That led some to ask us how CBC can countenance paying Cherry for nothing during the lockout or giving him free video for his commercial venture with Rock 'Em Sock 'Em. To clarify: Cherry is a HNIC contractor, not a CBC staffer. So he, like Glenn Healy and others, is not being paid his usual salary until the NHL games resume. He's free to do limited outside work so long as it doesn't conflict with his HNIC role. As for the NHL action featured on Cherry's video, his company pays the league for the rights. Which tells you how profitable the videos have been for him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plucking the peacock</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've documented how corporate Canada and United States have soured on the NHL during its self-indulgent labour fight. Now, more evidence why NBC is simmering over the extended battle for a contract. NBC Sports Network (formerly Versus) was counting on NHL games as their principal live content, delivering the network from its former outdoor life and fishing focus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that hasn't happened. Despite importing the popular Dan Patrick radio program and Bob Costas's interview show, NBCSN ratings are still just friends-and-family. Only a partial NFL game and a boxing card drew more than 200,000 viewers in December. Advertisers looking for a sports network are instead seeing the same-old from NBCSN. Hunting and fishing shows delivered 14 of the top 20 highest-rated time slots in December. In short, the lack of NHL games has been a disaster at a time when virtually all sports programing is raking in big money. Leading industry insiders to wonder just how Gary Bettman survives his phyrric victory over his players.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In rainy Vancouver, where I grew up, the rare snowfall became an event. Swaddled in borrowed ski clothes, we hiked to the local hill high above the beach, and lay stomach-down on our toboggans, feeling what it is to fly.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That memory resurfaced this week as I peered down the well-worn hill at our local park in Toronto, littered with discarded garbage bag-sleds, the trail a muddy brown. And then a little kid – the size of a large teddy bear, really – zipped down on her red toboggan, squealing happily. I had a kill-joy thought: Would it be weird if I ran after her with a helmet?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a cyclist with scars, I'm a helmet evangelist, but I'm not so proud of this – it puts me in league with the dreaded “bubble-wrap” parents who strap knee-pads on crawling babies and think they can prevent all harm. To me, the helmet symbolizes a loss: This generation of sledding kids will never know that losing their toque is a sign of a great run, or feel the wind in their hair as they speed away on a bicycle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So much of parenting is a refraction of our own childhoods. The decisions we make are often a nostalgic act, for better or worse. A recent book called Parent-Babble: How Parents Can Recover From Fifty Years of Bad Expert Parenting, by syndicated American columnist John Rosemond, asserts that we should all return to parenting the way our folks did back in the old days when young people never committed suicide, self-mutilated or talked back, and winged pigs circled overhead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rosemond blames decades of psychologists exalting self-esteem over “proper social decorum” and suggests parents take their lead from “elders” and community leaders. Well, okay – who isn't in favour of stronger communities and inter-generational wisdom?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Rosemond comes down absurdly hard on today's parents, furnishing a particularly conservative strain of sky-is-falling panic with his romantic idealization of his 1950s childhood (my parents were kids in the forties and pepper their tales of jazz bands and proms with memories of peers whose lives had fallen into sadness and neglect). Rosemond's ye olde childhood is fantasy; like all nostalgia, it's an ache for something that never was. Similarly, I'm projecting my own childhood onto my kids when I mourn the helmet-free bike ride or lament the fact that their favourite toy is my smartphone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's kids live in a very different world, one in constant motion, a blur of computers, cellphones, blended families, ADHD diagnoses – a world with Psy in it. Some of grandpa's wisdom is relevant now; some useless. As Lisa Belkin wrote on The Huffington Post in an excellent critique of Rosemond's book: “We cannot wish the social changes away. We shouldn't want to, because so many of them – gender equality comes to mind – are hard-won victories. But while we have probably overshot in our response to this new, unsettling world, and while it is certainly time to rethink and ratchet back our parenting, nostalgia for the good old days will just set us turning in circles.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wondered if I was turning in circles when our kids started to walk to school this year. This old-school act involved much 2012-style preparation: mapping the route, talking and stranger-proofing, and a few trial runs with some parental skulking behind trees and fences, Scooby-Doo style.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, when Lenore Skenazy wrote a column for The New York Sun about letting her then nine-year-old son ride the subway in New York, several media outlets dubbed her “the worst mom in America.” But as she points out in her book Free-Range Kids, kids are actually safer than they've ever been. In the United States, the <span class="companylink">FBI</span> estimates that a child is 25 times more likely to be killed in a car accident than by a predator. Crime is down in both the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But where kids are concerned, the extreme and the tragic are the stories that make the news and feed the fear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty, lunged for some easy points after the terrible Newtown killings, promising to lock schools province-wide, at a cost of $10-million (this during a tumultuous labour dispute with teachers' unions). Schools are one of the last public gathering places that aren't trying to sell us stuff. They should be more open to their neighbourhoods, not less. Maybe buzzers aren't a big deal, but the idea of constant fortification and viewing the community closest to our kids as threatening is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the best way to assuage the fear is to parent with balance, acknowledging the realities of contemporary life and invoking the more intelligent habits of the past. Walking to school is healthier; they arrive home with a swagger of accomplishment and independence. Turns out that particular parenting decision wasn't about my nostalgia but their freedom – no helmets required.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those of us imbued with high levels of self-loathing, New Year's Resolution Week (yes, I'm stretching it out, like retailers with Boxing Day – I need a whole week to confront my problems) is our highest holiday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's our Yom Kippur, a chance to look back on the past 12 months – and squirm and groan with shame, regret and self-recrimination, to ask ourselves “why, why, why?” and to bring our fists down on the table and swear that this year everything's going to be different, including and especially everything about us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To put it in perspective: My wife, Pam, who (quite rightly, I think) feels pretty good about the shape she's in, the state of her career, and how she conducted herself in 2012, has made a New Year's resolution to roll up her sleeves and organize her pictures and videos. She's a little ticked at herself, quite frankly, because that was also her New Year's Resolution last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disorganized pictures and videos: That's her biggest regret from 2012! Whereas I, simmering in a jambalaya of self-loathing like a fat capon, think back on the tragicomic festival of foolish faux pas, moronic missteps and richly deserved comeuppances that characterized 2012 for me – culminating in a bizarre “exploding fondue” incident on New Year's Eve. (I became impatient with how slowly the cheese was melting, and transferred what I thought was a heat-proof casserole dish from its bain-marie right onto the element.) I hang my head in shame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But see, this is the beauty of this time of year. That was “Old Dave.” He's got nothing to do with me! I hereby announce a completely revamped, vastly improved Nuevo Dave-o for 2013!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nuevo Dave-o 2013 will eat less, drink less, weigh less, exercise more, earn more – generally make hair-raising improvements to every aspect and facet of Old Dave's character.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For starters, Nuevo Dave-o will be nice to mother at all times. Everyone agrees: My mother is a true delight and great humanitarian. So why would anyone be such an ungrateful wretch as to be testy with her? (Maybe because mothers have a way of pushing buttons. Actually, they don't even need buttons. They have a special remote.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I recently had a bit of an eye scare and wound up in the emergency room, my vision all blurry. I was levitating with fear I might be going blind. Anyway, it was nothing, but when I tell my mother, a former nurse who has a bee in her bonnet about the connection between (Old Dave's) high blood pressure and macular degeneration, she slyly asks: “When you were at the hospital, did they take your blood pressure?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I actually brought the palm of my hand down on the kitchen island: “Mom! It wasn't macular degeneration! I can't believe you'd bring that up! Again!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that's classic “Old Dave.” No more of that. Faced with a similar set of circumstances, Nuevo Dave-o 2013 will smile quietly to himself and reflect that his mother is just looking out for him, as she always has.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking of remaining calm, Nuevo Dave-o 2013 will do so at all times. As I write this, we're on a family vacation in a (rented) cottage in the middle of nowhere, and on our way in it got a little dark, we got a little lost, we were a little low on gas and, I confess, I got a little panicky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Old Dave: What a coward. Pam had to be the one with the “cool head that prevailed,” I'm ashamed to say. From now on it's going to be Nuevo Dave-o with the cool head that prevails. My dome's going to be so frosty, I'll have to brush off the snow before putting on a hat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nuevo Dave-o will also keep in better touch with far-flung friends and siblings; honour my father, not to mention my father-in-law and mother-in-law; pontificate less and listen more to my kids, remember that they have at least as much to teach me as I do them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In business matters, I plan to take my cue from this real-estate agent who showed up at my door one day, cold-calling. I hate people who roll up and knock on the door, interrupting my work flow – but she was so nice and friendly, I wound up showing her around the house. And she's been e-mailing me ever since, even though I've told her the only way Pam and I are leaving this house is in a pine box, or escorted by bailiffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The point is: “incredibly friendly yet unbelievably persistent” – my watchwords for business affairs in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor do I forget my relationship with you, gentle readers (“and still gentler purchasers,” as Byron would say). I love you all. Whatever your resolutions are, let's all stick to them together, friends. As Bane says in The Dark Knight Rises (under somewhat sinister circumstances, I admit): “It doesn't matter who we are. What matters is our plan.” Truer words have never been spoken – at least, not by a guy wearing a mask that pumps painkillers into his face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So join me, people, in making a plan, and executing it with the will, conviction, and energy of a super-villain in 2013. I can feel it. This could be it – the year everything changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What am I supposed to do now?</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Portrait in Shame</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One day in 1912, the Viennese painter Egon Schiele painted a portrait of his lover. Nothing unusual about that: Schiele, a contemporary of Gustav Klimt, frequently painted his many lovers, and usually in a fiercely defiant style that graphically depicted their erotic allure.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this painting, which would come to be called Portrait of Wally, was different: The subject is fully clothed, and her blue eyes gaze at the viewer with gravity and confidence that suggests an attraction to the painter that transcends the purely carnal. Clearly, at the time of the painting, Valerie Neuzil, known to the painter as ‘Wally,' had a powerful hold on Schiele. As she would over many people for the next century, for reasons that have as much to do with the lingering historical stain of Nazism as it does Wally's inherent allure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Shea's Portrait of Wally, screening next Wednesday and Thursday at the Bloor Hot Docs Cinema in Toronto as part of its monthly Doc Soup program, is an account of greed, betrayal, culpability and self-serving moral relativism. It does dark justice to that other famed account of postwar Viennese murk and intrigue, Carol Reed's 1949 film noir The Third Man. But where that fictional movie, written by Grahame Greene, contained its story of Nazism's long shadow to the city itself, Shea's non-fiction movie finds its most menacing intrigue in the high-stakes, multimillion-dollar art world of New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For it was there, on the walls of <span class="companylink">the Museum of Modern Art</span> in 1997, that Schiele's painting, now worth millions of dollars, was spotted by a family member of the late Lea Bondi, a Jewish gallery owner – and friend of Schiele's. The painting was stolen, by a Nazi art collector, from Bondi's apartment during the process of ‘aryanization' that took place after Hitler's annexation of Austria in 1938.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus began one of the more outrageously protracted and shameful episodes in contemporary art world history, as the surviving family of Bondi attempted to prevent the painting from returning to Austria – from where it had been loaned by a private Schiele collector and gallery owner who'd secured the painting for his own collection after Bondi had gone to him for help retrieving it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Claiming that holding the painting in the U.S. until proper provenance could be determined would threaten the livelihood of major art institutions such as MOMA, the New York art institutional establishment did everything – including, it is suggested, get one of the film's co-producers fired from his reporting stint on National Public Radio – to block the process whereby legitimate ownership of the painting could be determined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the case eventually wound up with a settlement that paid the family $19-million (U.S.) for the painting's return to the Leopold Museum in Vienna, Shea's film leaves you with a clinging sense of unfinished dirty business. It's not just the sheer amount of expense and effort Bondi's family were compelled to invest to acquire what evidence suggested was so clearly theirs, it's the truly troubling collusion of so many influential art world players in blocking and delaying that outcome. That it took nearly 70 years for this particular Nazi crime to be even so unsatisfactorily resolved – the settlement assured that nobody was ever made to admit any wrongdoing – suggests that the pain and havoc is still being felt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Amour</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another kind of legacy is being honoured by the retrospective titled A Man and A Woman at the TIFF Bell Lightbox in Toronto starting next week (Jan. 11 to Feb. 4). Inspired by the release next Friday of Michael Haneke's internationally heralded, Palme d'Or winning Amour, which stars the French screen stalwarts Jean-Louis Trintignant (now 82) and Emmanuelle Riva (85) as an elderly couple facing mortality and an unthinkable separation, the program offers a parallel tracking of two of the European cinema's most remarkable, varied and consistently adventurous careers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you consider that together, Riva and Trintignant have appeared in works by Alain Resnais, Eric Rohmer, Krzysztof Kieslowski, Georges Franju, Jean-Pierre Melville and now Haneke, their long careers amount to a virtual tour of some of the finest European movies of the past 50 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">See Amour, then see what came before.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the holidays, my child's school held a series of fundraisers – book sales, bake sales, pizza lunches and so on – and they asked for parent volunteers for each activity. I felt overwhelmed by the requests as my partner and I both work, and it was difficult to participate. I expect to have a bit more time in the new year, however, and would like to do something to help my child's school. How do I decide which volunteer activities I should sign up for?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just when you thought you had enough piled on your plate, there is pressure to help out at your child's school. Don't despair. The tasks can be enjoyable – and it's a great way to learn more about the learning environment your child is in for five days a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anelia Coppes, a mother of four and school council chair in Parry Sound, Ont., provides this advice: “I have always chosen the volunteer activity at the school depending on my kid's activity. If my daughter's class was involved with the book sale, then that's where I would be.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Older children, on the other hand, don't necessarily want their parents lingering around them when they are with their friends, so ask before you show up to supervise the school dance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many school councils have sign-up sheets, or, better yet, you can ask the school's principal or vice-principal what activities need volunteers. Full-time working parents may not be able to show up during the school day to help struggling readers, for example. But perhaps if you have a talent for sewing or crafts, you could put it to use for the latest school play or concert. There is always plenty of behind-the-scenes work that takes place, so ask the parent council chair how you can help outside the work day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ontario, where teachers have withdrawn voluntary activities as a result of job action, it could be useful to check in with the principal on what extra help you can provide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't discount the benefits to you and your partner. Helping out at school is a great way to get to know neighbours and other parents and to become part of a community. And seeing parents involved in their school tells kids that you care about their education and care about giving back.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First we strike the Royal Commission.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then we launch the 32-part newspaper series on “Whither Canadian Hockey?” Then Peter Mansbridge and The National go on location and report directly from every backyard rink and driveway and child's imagination in the country. Then we arrange summits and symposia and present learned academic papers on where this country has to pick up its game in every area from stick taping to skate sharpening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But first we deal with the culprits. Dare we do, as Sweden's top daily did following Team Sweden's humiliating meltdown at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, when the Swedes were beaten by Belarus, run mug shots of every one of these acne-battling kids on the front page with a single headline: “Guilty!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take a pill, Canada. A very good team got beaten by a better team on this ice-cold day in Ufa, a team that on another day – say, just last Sunday – the team that lost on this day could just as easily have been the winner. As a disheartened Canadian head coach Steve Spott put it following Canada's 5-1 defeat at the hands of the Americans, “When you get down to one game, anything can happen in junior hockey.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in this case it most certainly did. The Canadians, so fleet through the four games of the opening round, were suddenly slow and uncertain on the ice. So skilled and smart for four games, in one game they became awkward and thoughtless. So patient and determined had they been in successfully coming back against Slovakia, in this game they became impatient and lost resolve and never did mount a counterchallenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One game, one disaster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is, of course, no such thing. At its worst, it is simply a loss in a game children play – and in this case a game actually played by children, all of them teenagers, some of them yet to shave. At its best, it remains an opportunity for a medal in a world-class event, the one sport in the hundreds of athletic competitions where Canadians rather naively and increasingly foolishly say nothing will do but gold. Canada will now play for bronze, and a bronze medal is not, as so many would have it, an insult to the national psyche.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surely it cannot be that frail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A bronze medal's a medal,” said freewheeling Canadian defenceman Ryan Murphy when it was over. “It's third in the world. It's not a crappy award.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet, and yet. … already the navel-gazing and head-scratching and tipsy talk-radio calls have begun. What went wrong?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, a great deal went wrong. Spott, in retrospect, thought maybe he and his assistants might have slammed the dressing room door shut before the game and set a verbal fire under them. But surely a pep talk was unnecessary. It was, after all, a game they had to win to reach their goal, a game against the archrival Americans. If they couldn't get up for that then they weren't up to it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Something happened to the new big line of Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, Mark Scheifele and 17-year-old Jonathan Drouin. Nugent-Hopkins could find no space, Scheifele was physically driven to the ice many times, Drouin was so frustrated his body language was screaming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What happened was they got shut down. A good defensive team will do that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe it was the goaltending … again. Just as the world juniors have become a Canadian ritual, a recent parallel ritual is to question Canadian goaltending. After Jacques Plante and Terry Sawchuk came Ken Dryden and Tony Esposito. After them Patrick Roy and Martin Brodeur and … There have been excellent goaltenders from Canada, but the rest of the world, it seems in recent years, have produced even more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should Malcolm Subban have had those goals? One, maybe two, but Roy and Brodeur let in softies in many of their best games, let alone their best years. Should Subban have been replaced earlier? Who knows? Jordan Binnington played fine, but it wasn't the same situation at all, being down 4-0, and he did let in one goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only thing we can say for certain is the pressures placed on whoever plays net for Team Canada at the 2014 tourament will be beyond cruel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Did all that talk in recent days of a return to NHL action have an effect? The questions were fired at the likes of Nugent-Hopkins and Scheifele, both of whom have NHL experience, and perhaps it was distracting. However, similar questions were thrown the direction of the American players who have been drafted by NHL teams and, obviously, they had no trouble with their focus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What was it, then? The big ice surface? Jet lag? The flu bug? Bad officiating? An unlucky ruble buried at centre ice?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How about none of the above?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And how about just accept the obvious truth about hockey at any level – stuff happens – and say that the time has come to dispense with that self-inflicted wound in the Canadian hockey vocabulary that says “gold or nothing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is, after all, just a game.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dalton McGuinty has been Premier of Ontario for long enough, has put his family through enough sacrifice, that it's normally hard to begrudge him a day off.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on this day, it just didn't feel right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You just have to take ownership of some decisions, right or wrong. And one that could lead simultaneously to ongoing chaos in the province's schools, a protracted legal battle and all sorts of grief for your successor surely fits the bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet it was Education Minister Laurel Broten left to explain on Thursday why the government will use the powers of the controversial Bill 115 to impose new contracts on teachers' unions unilaterally; she also had the honour of extending a flimsy olive branch in the form of a rather meaningless promise to repeal that legislation once it has served its purpose. As for Mr. McGuinty, he did all his talking through a three-page open letter that hinted at this outcome the previous day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In so doing, the Premier displayed a now-familiar aloofness toward his former allies in the teachers' unions that would have been unthinkable at this time last year. Evident since last spring, it combined with intermittently peculiar strategic judgment to make the labour battle even more unpleasant than it needed to be, and even more hazardous to the prospects of whoever winds up leading the governing Liberals when Mr. McGuinty makes his exit this winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the warm and fuzzies in the world would not have prompted the <span class="companylink">Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation</span> or especially the militant <span class="companylink">Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario</span> to roll over and give the government what it wanted, including various wage-restraint measures and an end to banking sick days. But Mr. McGuinty barely even attempted to trade on all the goodwill accumulated over the eight years he treated teachers generously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than meet directly, he kicked off negotiations last March by imploring them through a <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> video to “do your part.” While he later admitted the tactic “backfired,” it set the tone for what followed – the government trading heavily in ultimatums, with the Premier's Office calling the shots but Ms. Broten serving as the front person.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although that strategy worked with the relatively compliant Catholic teachers' association, it otherwise widened rifts. And rather than trying to bridge them, as the 2012-13 school year loomed, the Liberals sought to exploit them. In the lead-up to a September by-election that could have restored their legislative majority, they positioned their erstwhile friends as enemies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When that backfired as well, with the Liberal candidate placing third, a bunker mentality appeared to set in. While there were glimmers of hope with the OSSTF after a mediator was brought in, the government concluded that ETFO was a lost cause. And when teachers began to schedule one-day strikes before the Christmas break, as it became obvious that contracts were going to be imposed early in the new year, even the Liberal caucus was in the dark as to how the government might respond, impeding MPPs' ability to communicate the government's intentions to the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of this is to let the unions off the hook; what the government asked wasn't especially unreasonable, and their response has been out of sync with what most Ontarians have experienced in recent years. But a Premier who in the past showed an admirable willingness to defend tough decisions clearly wanted little part of this one – consistently letting Ms. Broten hold the bag, even after he had no cause to worry about re-election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He clearly worried about something, though. That pledge to repeal Bill 115, which becomes an empty shell as soon as its powers are used, might best have been left to his successor as a symbolic gesture to put distance between himself or herself and Mr. McGuinty. Instead, the Premier burned it up in hope either of clearing the decks or leaving on a less sour note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either way, it might have been more effective if Mr. McGuinty had made the promise himself, using the communication prowess he once displayed to explain why it was necessary. But that would have required something he evidently didn't have in him any more.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The children of today will not die at younger ages than their parents did, if a meta-analysis of 97 studies from North America, Europe, Asia and Australia is to be believed. Except at extremely high levels of obesity – 35 and above on the Body Mass Index – obesity is not linked to shorter lifespans, according to the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. And being overweight, surprisingly, is linked to longer life, more than being of “normal” weight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Being obese or overweight can be harmful, and the study doesn't say otherwise. Obesity is linked to cardiovascular disease, hypertension, Type 2 diabetes and some forms of cancer. But there's a moral panic around obesity, and the careless assertion that obesity will make lifespans shorter shows how out of control it has become.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, a recent comment article in these pages began with the assertion about tomorrow's lifespan being shorter, then argued that the number-one strategy for making Canada's health system sustainable would be to prevent obesity. The direct health-care costs in 2008 linked to overweight and obesity for treating eight conditions was $2-billion. A perfect world would be cheaper, but fat people won't bring medicare crashing down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs of that moral panic about obesity all around. In the United Kingdom and in Arkansas, report cards note a child's BMI. Some scientists have warned that those who are overweight before the age of five may be obese when they grow older. The guilt and shame being foisted on children and their parents are enormous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a quality to public concern about obesity that at times seems more cultural – based on stereotypes or prejudices about gluttony, body shapes and “taking care of oneself” – than grounded in science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one group seemingly not entitled to the tolerance promoted in our diverse society is heavy or fat people. Why? They are seen, culturally, as having brought their problems on themselves. Therefore, if the solutions seem drastic, even harmful – report cards that all but scream out “fatty” – well, you can't make an omelette without breaking some eggs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moral panic is a licence to bully. Preach first, worry later about who got singled out for derision. The public's concern seems to stop at the emotional or mental-health effects of the constant and disproportionate singling out of obesity and overweight as a problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The facts are so much more complex. Many fat people do diet; the diets usually make them fatter in the long term. Exercise may not cause heavy people to lose weight. Not all overweight or obese people are unhealthy. To be fat and fit is better than to be slim and unfit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panic is unwarranted and damaging. Laying to rest the myth that fuelled it may allow for more constructive approaches based on more movement and healthier eating, at any weight.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Living with strangers in temporary (and cramped, filthy, loud, whatever) housing situations is a socially and economically essential rite of passage for most twentysomethings (and, more and more frequently, thirtysomethings). And that rite of passage usually includes at least a few roommates gone wild. What is it about semi-strangers and subleases that encourages doing the kind of stuff that seems implausibly ridiculous or disgusting only a few years later?

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more common example of bad roommate behaviour is what Dave* experienced, or experiences; he messaged me via <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> about the “daily revolving door of various unnamed people” that his (otherwise kind and considerate) roommate meets on the gay hookup sites Grindr and Scruff. Dave says, “I don't judge and what happens in his life is his business; the thing is he never answers the door, ever. So, I get up and let these people in and just sit on the couch waiting for my roommate to finally come out of his room. I'm left with these awkward moments where we look at each other. … I don't really want to play the role of sexceptionist.” Dave says the best and worst part is “the ridiculous entrances,” like the guy who came up the stairs on his Rollerblades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How to confront (or ignore) these situations is one of the main takeaway lessons of living with other people; where else but a shared kitchen can you glean such important life lessons about mutual respect and boundaries? Of the rogue bedroom haircut, @muumuu2 tweeted, “I cleaned it up and never said anything bc I'm a baby/scared of confrontation.” In a follow-up e-mail, she wrote, “I get really nervous about talking to my roommates about things that are bothering me even if it's just dishes or whatever.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dave took a braver and always more effective approach; he wrote that he initiated a conversation with his roommate, and “he does text [me] before bringing dudes into the house, or at least has the past couple of times.” In roommate terms, that's serious progress.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientific advances have shaped modern society, have led to increased health and well-being for Canadians and have played a leading role in forming public policy. The relationship between scientists and the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span> is critically important, given the crucial role of science advice in supporting our country's long-term interests.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Royal Society of Canada was founded in 1882 by an Act of Parliament because it was understood that public policy and scientific research needed to be in dialogue. Policy and science are in a mutual relationship based on the importance given by government to scientific advice in policy development, and the recognition by scientists that government decisions are made democratically and must take into account evidence beyond that provided by the scientific community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For this relationship to work, scientists have a responsibility to act ethically and to communicate their findings to the broader community. Science works only when discoveries made in the lab or in the field are communicated and debated, not only to other researchers but to all stakeholders. Governments, in turn, have to respect scientific advice and not impede the dissemination of scientific knowledge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists and the federal government can be at odds when government policy does not appear to be well-aligned with the best scientific advice. That tension is often constructive: For example, a 2010 report by scientists providing evidence that oil sands activity was polluting the Athabaska River led to several levels of government taking a fresh look at the monitoring practices and activity of the industry in the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This relationship is now at risk in Canada. Unreasonable limits are being placed on the ability of government-employed scientists to communicate their findings, whether through publication of their research results or attendance at scientific meetings. These restrictions seem particularly severe in topics related to the environment, where several government scientists have been denied the opportunity to discuss their work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A well-known case is that of Kristi Miller, a scientist in the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. She published research on the Pacific salmon stock in 2010 in the international journal Science but has not been allowed to discuss her work publicly since. The government, in its defence, has affirmed that it needs to control what its employees say, arguing that what they say could be construed as representing the views of the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several scientific organizations, most notably the prominent journals Nature and Science, have raised the alarm and urged the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span> to rescind the restrictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such restrictions fly in the face of the government's own cabinet policy of basing policy decisions on the best science available. Furthermore, they go against the positions taken by countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, where scientists are expected to give their advice independently and free of restrictions, whether or not they're employed by the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This disruption in the relationship between scientists and government is avoidable. What's needed is a policy that clarifies the relationship between scientists, the advice they provide and the federal government. This should lay out the responsibility of the government to solicit and develop the best scientific advice possible in formulating public policy. It should underscore the government's commitment to advance scientific knowledge and not to hinder its dissemination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should also demonstrate the government's commitment to use scientific advice in policy-making, recognizing the uncertainties that often come with it. It should ensure the independence of scientific advice from government control. And it should reaffirm the responsibility of scientists to conduct their work ethically, to communicate it fairly and to declare their own conflicts of interest. Such a policy will strengthen the role of science in public policy development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada will only succeed as a country if it's able to harness the best scientific advice to make decisions. The federal government should immediately unshackle government scientists and let them do their jobs. The integrity of evidence-based public policy development is at stake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The public should be allowed to learn directly from our scientists when they make discoveries in areas of public concern.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confirmed as the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner seemed to steel himself for the struggles that await him as he seeks to herd his raucous caucus.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Public service was never meant to be an easy living,” the Ohio Republican said at Thursday's opening of the new Congress. “Extraordinary challenges demand extraordinary leadership.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the de facto leader of the Republican Party, it will fall to Mr. Boehner to contain the civil war that threatens to engulf his party. But the Speaker, who choked up with emotion after his re-election to the top House post on Thursday, knows he might lose it all trying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the so-called fiscal cliff standoff that ended this week, a series of high-stake budget battles with President Barack Obama now await Mr. Boehner. Beginning with a showdown over raising the $16.4-trillion (U.S.) debt ceiling, they will test the Speaker's ability to do his job without rattling financial markets or sparking a caucus revolt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Boehner, 63, is acutely aware that the GOP needs to shed its extremist label if it is to have much hope of gaining seats in Congress, much less the White House. But he also knows that most of his 232 members come from deep red districts and see compromise as an open invitation to a primary challenge. Reconciling the two will be exhausting work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is going to take an incredible amount of leadership for Boehner to keep his governing majority together,” said Daniel Smith, a political science professor at the University of Florida. “He is more interested in preserving a broad Republican Party than capitulating to the extremists. He realizes the party has to do that if it wants to stay competitive.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, two-thirds of Republican House members, including Majority Leader Eric Cantor, voted against a fiscal-cliff compromise that Mr. Boehner supported. The compromise only passed because all but 16 Democrats voted for the bill to avert more than $400-billion (U.S.) in middle-class tax increases and spending cuts set for Jan. 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most House Republicans objected to the bill's tax increases on households earning more than $450,000, even though GOP anti-tax enforcer Grover Norquist gave his benediction to the legislation. He reasoned it was consistent with his Taxpayer Protection Pledge because the bill made the expiring Bush-era tax cuts on the middle-class permanent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What looked like a repudiation of Mr. Boehner by his members, however, was really an illustration of the fancy stickhandling that has earned the Speaker the admiration of his caucus. Only nine Republicans voted against him in Thursday's Speaker's election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speakers typically only allow votes on bills that can pass with a so-called “majority of the majority.” But sticking to that rule would have effectively led to the fiscal-cliff bill's demise, leaving Republicans to bear the blame for economic upheaval that followed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By letting the bill pass with a majority of Democrats, Mr. Boehner allowed his Republican members “to have their cake and eat it, too,” explained Mark Jones, a political science professor at <span class="companylink">Rice University</span> in House. “The image of the Republican Party was not tarnished by taking the country over the cliff. But a majority of GOP members can return to their districts saying they did not vote for a tax increase.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, Mr. Boehner has not always looked so clever. Last month, he sought to increase his leverage over Mr. Obama in the fiscal-cliff negotiations by scheduling a House vote on a bill to make the Bush tax cuts permanent for households making less than $1-million. But his caucus balked and he had to pull the bill before the vote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After that embarrassing slip-up, Mr. Boehner sought to partially make up for it this week by refusing to hold a vote on about $60-billion in aid to states hit by Hurricane Sandy. After voting to raise taxes in the fiscal-cliff bill, the Speaker figured he was asking too much of his members to follow up with a bill that increases spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That prompted a backlash from northeastern Republicans, including popular New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Mr. Boehner quickly relented and scheduled a vote for Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Sandy faux pas may be quickly forgiven, the fiscal-cliff compromise will never be forgotten. Reached to avert one crisis, it may have planted the seeds for another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many conservatives think Mr. Boehner and Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell played directly into Mr. Obama's hands by agreeing to tax increases, violating a key GOP principle that will lead to the party's fracture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is a complete surrender on everything,” columnist Charles Krauthammer told Fox News on Tuesday. “The ratio of tax hikes to spending cuts [in the fiscal-cliff bill] is 40-to-one. … So, it's a complete rout by the Democrats.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the fiscal-cliff compromise behind him, Mr. Boehner will be under intense pressure from the right to drive an extra-hard bargain with Mr. Obama over the debt ceiling. The borrowing limit must go up by March to prevent the <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> from defaulting on its bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Boehner has said he is seeking $1 in spending cuts for every $1 increase in the debt ceiling. Mr. Obama has indicated he will not “play that game.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Speaker, it could come down to another choice between his country and his caucus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NEW CONGRESS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Politically, the 213th Congress that was sworn in Thursday won't be much of a change from the less-than-stellar 212th Congress it replaces: The balance of power is unchanged, with Republicans controlling the House and Democrats holding a majority in the Senate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet a closer look finds Congress undergoing some of the changes that have altered the face of America, with women and minorities playing increasingly more prominent roles. For the first time, white men will be a minority among House Democrats. CQ Roll Call newspaper estimates the House will include some 277 Protestants and Catholics, 22 Jews, two Muslims and two Buddhists. The Senate will have 80 Protestants and Catholics and 10 Jews. The House will have its first Hindu, Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat from Hawaii. Senate freshman Mazie Hirono, also of Hawaii, will be the Senate's only Buddhist.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States has a budget problem because it has a taxation problem. Americans don't pay enough tax. Unless they confront this unpleasant but inescapable reality, their country will be mired in a fiscal pit for a very long time.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government revenues took up 25.1 per cent of the U.S. economy in 2011, the lowest share in the <span class="companylink">Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development</span> (according to its data). By comparison, the Canadian share was 31 per cent, Britain 35.5 per cent and Germany 37 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A country can have a comparatively low tax take if it has a small government. But the U.S. has an enormous military budget and extensive social programs. These programs might not be as munificent as those in other advanced industrial countries, but they exist and they're costly: social security, public health care for seniors and the poor, unemployment insurance, food stamps and so on. Health care takes 17.6 per cent of the national income, the highest share in the OECD, without producing correspondingly better aggregate results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These programs are politically popular, and for good reason. They help and protect tens of millions of Americans who, left to their own devices, would be suffering more than some of them are now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Polls consistently underscore the political popularity of these programs. The wealthy don't like them because they don't need them. Right-wing zealots don't like them because, for them, Ayn Rand's mythologies live. But every time these programs are put in jeopardy, they survive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans once supported these major social programs; now a sizable chunk of them don't. They want vouchers for individuals instead of government programs. And they figure that, if they squeeze government revenues enough, the fiscal crisis will become so acute that they can maim or kill these programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is where the “no tax increase” mantra comes from, intellectually speaking. And where the drama over the “fiscal cliff” arose: the Republicans' insistence under George W. Bush to cut tax rates and to keep them there, even for millionaires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, roughly a third of House Republicans agreed to increase taxes on individuals earning more than $400,000, which allowed the modest package to pass. But the fact that a large majority of Republicans were willing to support continuing tax cuts for the wealthiest showed how deep into dogma they have dug themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Dysfunction” as a way of describing political America has become a cliché. What Americans just witnessed in the weeks between the election and the New Year's Day deal was pathetic. The U.S. system is designed to make decisions difficult, but not this difficult. It now appears that the harder the decisions, the more dysfunctional the system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing suggests this spectacle won't resume when the new Congress assembles this month, since nothing of fundamental importance has been done to move the country toward a stronger fiscal position. And nothing can be done unless Americans are willing to tax themselves more to pay for what they continue to want from their governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was argued by Republicans in the election that Americans could have their cake and eat it, too. Taxes could remain at Bush-era levels, and even be reduced further, while military spending could be increased, if unspecified spending cuts and reductions in tax deductions followed. This mishmash was an intellectual fraud that nonetheless attracted the votes of nearly half the electorate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democrats, for their part, were unwilling to confront the billowing costs of the social programs that have been growing at faster rates than economic growth plus inflation. Nor are they willing, like the Republicans, to tell Americans that more of them will have to pay more tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The huffing and puffing to avoid the country's falling over the “fiscal cliff” into recession has produced a short-term deal that postponed more difficult decisions. What we just saw was prelude rather than finale. Self-absorbed wrangling, interspersed with bouts of paralysis, beckons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No serious spending reductions were included in this deal, and taxes were only raised on the wealthiest citizens, who'll spend considerable money figuring out how to minimize the impact.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large elements of aboriginal Canada live intellectually in a dream palace, a more comfortable place than where they actually reside.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside the dream palace, there are self-reliant, self-sustaining communities – “nations,” indeed – with the full panoply of sovereign capacities and the “rights” that go with sovereignty. These “nations” are the descendants of proud ancestors who, centuries ago, spread across certain territories before and, for some period, after the “settlers” arrived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's reality, however, is so far removed in actual day-to-day terms from the memories inside the dream palace as to be almost unbearable. The obvious conflict between reality and dream pulls some aboriginals to warrior societies; others to a rejection of dealing with the “Crown” at all; others to fights for the restoration of “rights” that, even if defined, would make little tangible difference in the lives of aboriginal people; and still others, such as Attawapiskat Chief Theresa Spence, to go on a hunger strike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief Spence, leading a group or “nation” of about 1,500 people on the shores of James Bay, demanded at the beginning of her strike a series of meetings with the Governor-General and the Prime Minister. This demand reflected a very old and very wrong idea (part of dream-palace thinking) that the “Crown” is somehow an independent agency with which aboriginal “nations” have a direct relationship, whereas the “Crown” is nothing of the sort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The “Crown” is the <span class="companylink">Government of Canada</span>, a matter of clearly established constitutional law, which is why Chief Spence made her demand to meet the Prime Minister, too. Stephen Harper was correct in refusing a face-to-face meeting, since a prime minister should not be blackmailed into doing what any group or individual wants. On Friday, however, he did agree to meet soon with a group of aboriginal leaders that could include Chief Spence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief Spence has attracted various predictable public adherents to her cause. Something that calls itself the Idle No More movement has sprung up here and there – a rather unfortunate name if one thinks that it might suggest previous idleness. Some chiefs have welcomed the movement; others have distanced themselves from it, either because they prefer to control aboriginal politics themselves or because they understand that scattered incidents of protest that inconvenience others are a surefire way of dissipating support for the aboriginal cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the rhetoric surrounding Chief Spence is of the usual dreamy, flamboyant variety, a mix of anti-capitalism and anti-colonialism, blended with the mythology (blasted by the reality of what one actually sees on too many reserves) about environmental protection and the aboriginals' sacred link to their lands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To this is then added a desire to protect “traditional” ways, which in some cases means hunting, fishing and trapping, noble ventures that can lead economically to something only slightly better than subsistence. Without a wage economy beyond these “traditional” ways, the path lies clear to dependence on money from somewhere else, namely government, which, in turn, leads to the lassitude and pathologies that plague too many aboriginal communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, there are some communities that offer the antithesis of dependency. They benefit from participating directly in the exploitation of natural resources near their communities, which should be the driving thrust of all public policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These communities have decided collectively to integrate to varying degrees with the majority cultures, to form business arrangements (where possible) in a vital attempt to create own-source revenues that will dilute or end the spirals of dependency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But too many communities remain within the dream palace, hungering for a return to a more separate existence, even if the lands on which they sit are – and likely always will be – of marginal economic value. Attawapiskat, Chief Spence's community, is subject to severe flooding, given its location on the James Bay plain, but it refused to consider moving farther upriver or near Timmins, where there might be employment opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To imagine that isolated communities of a thousand or so people can be vibrant and self-sustaining, capable of discharging the panoply of responsibilities of “sovereignty,” is to live within the dream palace of memory.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're baaack! And it's your choice – the rough-hewn Doyles of St. John's or the rather hoity-toity occupants of Downton Abbey in dear old England.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On one, you'll hear the question asked, “What are you on, glue?” On the other, you'll hear a chap exclaim, “That treacle tart hit the spot!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downton Abbey (Sunday, 9 p.m., PBS, on Masterpiece Classic) returns to satisfy the lusts of people gripped by such shocking plot twists as Lady Sybil, the earl's daughter, running away with the chauffeur. This actually happened, as Downton devotees will know. Well, the couple is back and, as expected, certain people take a dim view of Tom the chauffeur, especially with him being Irish and all. In fact, a very cruel prank is played on him. He is also referred to, by a stuck-up knob, as “the grotty little chauffeur chap.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, however, is not the main event or anything remotely close to it. Crises abound in the new season of Downton, one that, frankly, looks increasingly creaky and dim as the story lines progress. There is the matter of how the household will survive without a footman. Below stairs, this is a major issue. A new footman must be hired and trained, sending Mr. Carson (Jim Carter) into a tizzy. He has no time for training “hobbledehoys,” he exclaims, thereby resurrecting a fine old word to describe an awkward youth. Anyway, a new footman is indeed found, one Alfred Nugent, a terribly tall, handsome young man whose good looks will get him into trouble. You just know it. “You're too tall to be a footman; no footman should be over 6 foot 1,” Carson says, sighing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real crisis, mind you, involves money. (I'm not giving much away here. It's in the promos used for season three.) As it turns out, Lord Grantham (Hugh Bonneville) gets the bad news early on in the first episode. “Are you really telling me that all the money is gone?” he asks a man in a London office. “I'm afraid so,” is the sad reply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And you, the reader, might wonder what happened. I can tell you: unwise investments in the Canadian railway! Now nearly skint, thanks to perfidious developments in Canada, the Crawley clan must “retrench,” as Jane Austen put it in Persuasion. This is a bit of a challenge, since Lady Mary is about to have a bang-up wedding and marry that nice Matthew. Wedding giddiness is rampant, I'm telling you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyway, the truly major twist is the arrival, at last, of Shirley MacLaine playing Lady Cora's rich and imperious American mother, Martha. As devotees of this nonsensical series have been anticipating with relish, that sets up a clash with the equally imperious Violet, Dowager Countess of Grantham, played with gusto by Maggie Smith. The arrival of Martha is rather bizarre. She steps out of a car dressed like a 1920s flapper and looking like she's been an early victim of bad Botox.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other stuff happens. The dowager patronizes Americans, and Martha patronizes the English. Not exactly witty ripostes, however. Mr. Bates is still in the hoosegow, but his stress is leavened by the attentions of housemaid Daisy, who has an almighty crush on him. Yes, as ever, Downton Abbey is silly rubbish presented with formidable skill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in other nonsensical but enjoyable series, Republic of Doyle (Sunday, 9 p.m., CBC) also returns and in its new Sunday-evening time slot. Just as Downton has the ceaseless, tortured romance of Matthew and Lady Mary, Doyle has the maddening relationship between Jake Doyle (Alan Hawco) and Sgt. Leslie Bennett (Krystin Pellerin). Mind you, Jake doesn't mope when he discovers, in the first episode, that Leslie has vamoosed from St. John's. Instead, he starts chatting up her replacement, Officer Monica Hayward (Patricia Isaac). Such is life in Doyle land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also the matter of Jake's beloved Pontiac GTO having gotten blown up last season and a replacement being needed. Oh, and Des Courtney (Mark O'Brien) was shot in the stomach, making him more annoying than usual.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what transpires first is the arrival of a Doyle cousin from Ireland, played with broth-of-a-boy energy by Angus Macfadyen. (Macfadyen is Scottish, making the accent a bit weird.) It seems this guy's son has gone missing, probably in Newfoundland, and he's probably in trouble. There ensue multiple shenanigans involving car chases, fistfights and gunplay, but nothing serious. In fact, the most serious element might be the revelation that that Tinny Doyle (Marthe Bernard) is now a police cadet, and is seen wielding a gun. Honestly, the Doyles are a mad crowd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Republic of Doyle, the language is more colourful than on Downton, the characters are actually more plausible, and the setting is far more striking. Also, there's no guff about servants and masters and complicated stuff about inheritances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's your choice. Now, choose carefully.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A truly awful thing happened in New Delhi. The horrendous gang rape of a 23-year-old woman on a moving bus was sadly far from a rare crime in the Indian capital, but this time it captured the nation's attention. Most tellingly, when she died this week of her injuries, her last words were: “Mummy, I am sorry … I am sorry.” In other words, as with a shocking number of rape victims in the subcontinent, she'd been made to feel that she was at fault in her own violation.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That caused something to happen – first in Delhi, then across India – that's promising and long overdue: Hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets and the media to denounce a climate of widely tolerated sexual assault, and a police and judicial neglect of sex crimes, that can credibly be called the worst in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indians have begun to recognize this epidemic of sexual hatred in their midst. Far from just a matter of rape, it's an environment where, in some regions, there are 800 girls alive for every 1,000 boys, because sex-selective abortion and female infanticide are so widespread; where the physical abuse of women is seen as mundane; where even major sex crimes are usually described in major newspapers as “Eve-teasing.” India finally awoke this week to its national shame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then an odd thing happened in Canada and other Western countries: A number of prominent people, notably anti-rape activists and feminists, rushed to declare that India's crisis wasn't notably severe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Rape and sexual violence against women are endemic everywhere,” argued writer Owen Jones, denouncing those who describe India's situation as a national crisis, since it's just part of a global “pandemic of violence against women.” Discussions of India, Irish feminist Emer O'Toole wrote, are misplaced as they only serve to “minimize the enormity of Western rape culture.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One Canadian activist told me, via <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, that Indians were wrong to describe their situation as an epidemic. “Labelling rape culture uniquely ‘Indian,' when it is ubiquitous, is unfair and ignores the real problem,” she said, arguing that Indians were overdoing it. “Does India need to navel-gaze about how its culture treats women? Yes, but so do all countries, really.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, it's not all the same. Not even close. To use the situation in New Delhi as a way to draw attention to sex crimes in Canada is akin to using the Rwandan genocide to make points about gang crime in Scarborough. Rape is a terrible crime everywhere, and it probably remains underprosecuted and all too commonplace and hidden in many places in the West, so there's plenty of room for activism. But, in part because that activism has succeeded, rape is a grotesque anomaly, universally recognized as a serious crime. That's not true at all in many parts of India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Delhi last year, there were 625 rape cases brought to court, and only one resulted in a conviction. That's a conviction rate of 0.16 per cent; in comparison, English-speaking countries typically have rape conviction rates of between 40 and 70 per cent. Of course, the situation is actually far worse than that, because very few rapes in India are ever reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new report by the <span class="companylink">Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada</span> suggests that India's reported rapes are “the tip of the iceberg,” that the real numbers are extremely high and that they've likely been sharply on the rise for the past decade. We shouldn't pretend that this is an effect of poverty or a specific religion. In many poorer countries, rape is rare and taboo. In India, it's both Hindus and Muslims, the middle class and the poor, who participate; in fact, it's the less poor regions of India, in the north, where the murder of girls and the rape of women are most frequent. This hatred of women is a specific cultural development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, rape has become dramatically less commonplace in the West. In one of the most comprehensive long-term studies of rape, the U.S. National Crime Victimization Survey (conducted for the Department of Justice) shows that the number of women who say they've experienced rape today is one-fifth the level of 1973.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What that also shows is that change is possible, that India's epidemic isn't inevitable or natural. Activism can work – but talk of a “universal rape culture” only helps perpetuate the problem.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 2013, expect more integrity, more humanity and more morality in architecture. There will be some gains and serious rewards. But only if the rallying cry to break from conventional ideas of architecture comes from the people: clients, developers and the media.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These four ideas can inspire us to throw down our chairs from the windows, take to the barricades, and demand beauty, environmental breakthroughs and intelligent, healing landscapes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reconceiving the city</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">for a warmer world</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Responding creatively and effectively to the onslaught of water brought on by global warming is no longer a challenge restricted to impoverished regions of the world. As I walked along the mud flats of the Ganges River in the ancient city of Varanasi, India, last fall – where life-giving monsoon waters had climbed high to fertilize fields – houses in New Jersey were being pummelled by Hurricane Sandy, and rushing waters had paralyzed the Manhattan subway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the indefatigable boxer Cinderella Man, New York is standing again, being reconceived, post-Sandy, as a topography of inspired resilience, an invigorating landscape designed to protect people from the calamity of flood waters. As John F. Kennedy once said, “Most cities are nouns; New York's a verb.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Creative rethinking is what will be required to save the New York region from the next attack of water. Activists from New Orleans are being consulted, along with Dutch water-management experts who have developed some of the most sophisticated ways of keeping water at bay, from oyster reefs to extensive barriers both natural and man-made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Against this scenario, it has to be said that Toronto's Don River Park – a 7.3-hectare flood-protection landform set to open this summer – appears remarkably prescient. Envisioned decades ago in the aftermath of 1954's Hurricane Hazel, the sweeping, undulating green space reinvents a postindustrial site to include a toboggan hill and an outdoor fireplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As well, there will be a community kitchen in a wood-timbered pavilion, plus recreational trails and a festival square. Stand on the elevated hill and take in the newly protected city: To the east, there's now a flood plain designed by Michael van Valkenburgh Associates as an urban prairie stretching along the shores of the urban river. To the west are expansive views to the Distillery District and, beyond, the financial core – residential and economic-engine zones worth protecting – gracefully – from swelling waters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The climb to health</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coming year will also be significant for the increasingly global Fit City agenda: In Vancouver, New York, and Portland, Ore., cars are being rerouted to make way for an efficient, elegant flow of pedestrians, cyclists and skateboarders. Inside buildings, elevators are being tucked behind centrally located, exhilarating stairways, requiring people to exercise while making more room for the disabled in mechanical lifts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg took on smokers years ago, banishing them to pavements of exile. Now, with the backing of a formidable bureaucracy, he's pushing hard for even healthier bodies. The city's Department of Design and Construction has created a Center for Active Design, assigning an urban-fit educator to work with architects and landscape architects to train them on the need to create obesity-reducing architecture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It takes everybody coming together from facilities, roads, health; and strong leadership from elected officials,” says Joanna Frank, director of the Center. “Everybody in New York has been given permission to work together.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Active design guidelines” are being sold by Frank and her team to cities struggling with the crippling costs of obesity. The Region of Peel, a vast jurisdiction to the west of Toronto, has become their latest client. Following a one-day symposium led by a New York SWAT team intent on urban fitness, Peel has accelerated its healthy initiatives. Gayle Bursey, director of Chronic Disease and Injury Prevention for Peel Public Health, says that food served or sold by the region will be changed as a result of the symposium. And the city of Brampton is now moving ahead to establish a policy to insist on healthy food in its City Hall cafeteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the expanded Brampton City Hall, which will include the addition of committee rooms and administrative space, stairs will be designed as a central feature to offset elevator use. In Toronto, the hot-pink staircase rising four storeys through the new Rotman School of Managment by KPMB Architects is a free ticket to a healthier heart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Civic bows</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2013, the world will be exposed to the most expressive theatrical civic architecture of all time. Vancouver architect Bing Thom will be refining his competition-award-winning design for the $350-million Xiqu Center project, the Chinese folklore-opera house to open by 2016 in Hong Kong's new West Kowloon Cultural District. Thom's flamboyant scheme, with a front facade parted like a massive curtain, occupies a gateway site to a district planned to accommodate 16 cultural venues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a telephone interview this week, Thom told me that the Xiqu Centre is designed to honour the ancient practices of the South Chinese troubadours who once travelled from village to village to perform in temporary structures made of bamboo. “We're back to the traditional values about what a building is for, and how a building can serve society rather than how society can serve a building.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To that end, the change rooms will be configured to accommodate large trunks containing elaborate headdresses and costumes owned by the travelling actors, and doorknobs may be rethought to allow the heavily ornamented to glide easily through the space. The Xiqu Centre places a commercial mall underground and connected to a subway, so that operagoers arrive into an elevated courtyard where they can immediately see a theatre-training school, two tea houses and a large and small theatre. And, although the exact material is yet to be decided by Thom, the Centre will be defined by an exterior skin of shifting vertical fins that doubles as a projection screen and a means to allow air to flow naturally into the complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such theatrical flamboyance in architecture is hardly limited to Asia. In Scandinavia, an international, anonymous competition has attracted 544 entries and generated expressive proposals for the Helsinki Central Library. The six finalists include a building defined by a canted wooden pavilion with a soaring, sheltering roof; another echoes Thom's epic curtain entrance. The winner will be announced in June. The shortlisted six designs can be viewed at competition.keskustakirjasto.fi/stage-2-of-the-competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warmth without the warming</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's time to believe all over again in wood-timber structures and their time-honoured integrity. People warm immediately to wood. But there's also an environmental argument to be made for it. Concrete requires extreme heat for its manufacture, resulting in massive carbon emissions. Wood structures do not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new Laurentian School of Architecture in Sudbury, designed by Levitt Goodman Architects, is a template of innovative, daring design. The library wing (walls, floors and roof) is constructed of cross-laminated timber, or CLT, an engineered wood product made by gluing and pressing together successive layers of spruce, pine or fir two-by-fours or two-by-sixes to form large, solid blocks or sheets that can be precision-trimmed to specific purposes. The School will stand as the first significant use of cross-laminated timber in a public building in Ontario. Within an existing wooden train shed on campus, students will experiment with the newest wood products, including CLT, and apply their design skills to the timber mills of the North.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“CLT is to the 21st century what log construction was to the 19th century (and before). There is great potential, architecturally, to refine an aesthetic based on CLT construction that I find really exciting,” says design lead Janna Levitt. “The material can be exposed or not. There are acoustical benefits to CLT, as wood absorbs sound. And because it's wood, it does not behave like a thermal bridge.” A recent fire-rating test for laminated wood also shows its strong resistance to fire; many people in the building industry are calling it the new concrete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some brave hot spots of design, tall structures made almost entirely of wood are being conceived. Reiulf Ramstad Arkitekter is the Oslo-based firm responsible for the design of a wooden tower for the Barents Secretariat House in Kirkenes, Norway, on the fringes of the Arctic Circle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vancouver's Michael Green, lead designer on North Vancouver City Hall's expansion, was troubled enough by lax attitudes to the environment, and a lack of building innovation, to argue strongly for alternatives to concrete-and-steel structures. His design for a tall wood tower has generated considerable interest from developers – and organizers of the TED talks. In the coming weeks, he says, the world's tallest all-wood building may be announced for a site in British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the Pacific, on Melbourne's Victoria Harbour, a tower in wood is already being built. Ten storeys high, Forté, a residential building, is being constructed from cross-laminated timber. When completed, it will produce 1,400 fewer tonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions than a comparable concrete-and-steel structure, the equivalent of removing 345 cars from the roads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's enough discussion. Now, to the barricades.</p>

So bright and articulate is Williams (Yale, class of 2010), so polite and present (she apologized to my photographer for not anticipating his lighting needs), so at the beginning of everything (her Wikipedia page is still a stub), that I almost wrote her parents – Brian Williams, the NBC Nightly News anchor, and Jane Stoddard, a television producer – a tear-stained note of thanks for helping to produce such a blessed creature.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was, “I have trouble with time management” – which she defined as not finishing the papers she wrote as an English major early enough to edit them properly. There was, “Sometimes I'm not very co-ordinated,” and, “I'm terrible at sleeping.” At this point, Williams may have sensed that I was trying not to beam at her like some crazed auntie, because she wrapped up the list: “Oh my gosh, there are so many other things. There's just a lot; there's really, really a lot.” And then I had to beam at her, because she said “oh my gosh.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second season of Girls begins Jan. 13, and already uncountable pixels have been devoted to the ways its four heroines – Hannah (Lena Dunham, who writes and directs the series as well), the hapless, blunt-tongued Everygirl; Jessa (Jemima Kirke), the cool, reckless one; Shoshanna (Zosia Mamet), the anxious innocent; and Marnie (Williams), the most seemingly together one – embody the zeitgeist. Or at least the specific zeitgeist of twentysomethings in the hipster heaven of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, circa now, as they work the menial end of glamour jobs, sleep with boys who baffle them and try to figure out who they are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I can imagine how you, as a parent, want me to reassure you that we're exaggerating things,” Williams says with a grin that puts toothpaste ads to shame. “But I think Lena's tapped into something very, very real. She's almost journaling as she creates the show. Anthropologically, I feel this could be left behind as a piece of evidence of this current culture in these apartments in New York City.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The series's strength is that it delves into, in fearless and often unflattering detail, all the things that young women really do, say and think, especially the ones they're not supposed to. But I only had 10 minutes with Williams, so I focused on two areas that seem specific to her generation. First, these girls seem much more entangled with their parents than I was at 22.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Williams agrees. “I ask my friends, ‘When something exciting or terrible happens, who is your first phone call?'” she says. “They all answer, ‘My parents.' And we don't expect that to change after we get married.” Williams's relationship with her own parents is “very, very close” – she's even watched her show with them. “Though I wouldn't recommend it,” she says, laughing dryly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which brings me to my second observation. Though the Girls are sexually free, they frequently subjugate their desires to their partners'. In the whole of Season 1, the only orgasm any of the foursome has is the one Marnie gives herself, masturbating in a restaurant bathroom. What's up with that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That's not an accident,” Williams replies, as game to talk about this as she was to act it. “In most shows and movies, sex scenes end the same way” – with the woman quickly being satisfied – “and very vocally so. That was something that, without attacking or being angry with those, Lena was like, ‘I'm just going to show the other way this happens, and see if that resonates.' A ton of girls have told me it does, and it makes them feel better. Because the others instill in girls this feeling that there's something wrong with them.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of Season 1, Marnie was unravelling – she'd broken up with her long-term boyfriend (he was too nice), left her job and moved out of her apartment. Williams, on the other hand, has yet to make a misstep. Though her parents wouldn't let her act until she'd graduated, practically the moment she did, a video she'd made (of herself torch-singing Nature Boy to the Mad Men theme) caught the eye of Girls producer Judd Apatow, just as he was casting Marnie. Williams also plays Kate Middleton in a Funny or Die series.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I wanted to be an actress before I understood anything else about my life, before I went to school” – she grew up in New Canaan, Conn. – “before I understood what it is that my dad does,” Williams says. “It was innate. Everything, everything that's ever happened in my life happened within the framework of my knowing that this was where I was going to end up. So in school, I could learn purely for the sake of learning. It gave me this almost gluttonous sense of intellectual curiosity. I never want to stop learning.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She launches into a longish story: At Yale, she once asked for an extension to take a psychology exam because she was too immersed in a play to study. Her professor granted it, but recommended she take the test on time anyway. “He said, ‘Allison, you already know where you're going. So if you get a C on a psych test, it's not going to be the end of the world. The choice is yours.'” Her wide eyes widen further. She loves this story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was one of the most empowering, thoughtful things I've ever heard from someone,” she continues. “The fact that our actions can tell us what we want. You realize, ‘Oh, I must care about this, and not about that.' I think about that daily, I really, really do.” I really, really believe her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is the time when you realize and recognize some things about yourself,” Williams says, summing up both the appeal of Girls and this period of her own life. “And then the question is, Are you woman enough to deal with them? To live the rest of your life being aware of your flaws, and dealing with them on a daily basis – correcting the ones that affect other people, and working around or learning to love the ones that don't.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have no doubt that Williams is woman enough. She took that exam on time, of course. She did better than she'd thought she would.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the time of reckoning. The start of the new year. It may feel as if something died violently in your mouth over the holidays and you've only just noticed. Or you may sense the submerged monster of your liver trying to escape from your body like a creature from Loch Ness, though this beast is made of nine parts cheap champagne and one part crème de menthe.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer could lie in a brief stay at the Buffalo Restorium, which promises to help you “turn that New Year's leaf right” with a three-day cure to eliminate the desire for alcohol. Okay, it involves visiting Buffalo, but there is an upside: “All vegetable remedies, no hypodermic injections.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except, sorry, you can't visit the Buffalo Restorium because it's probably now a bar selling chicken wings: That advertisement for the New Year's cure appeared in The Globe and Mail on the first Saturday of January in 1913. In fact, a trawl through the pages of the New Year's Globe from a century ago reveals that our late-Edwardian forebears, fewer than 50 years weaned from the bosom of Empire, were just as desperate for physical refurbishment as we are today – and just as hopeless at achieving it. And their fad diets were no more bonkers than our own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Failing a trip to the Buffalo Restorium, a tosspot could always seek help through the Gatlin Treatment, advertised on Jan. 1, 1913, under the headline “Do You Drink?” Gatlin's regimen “takes you back to Manhood and Ability in THREE DAYS … or the fee will be refunded FORTHWITH.” You want a rehab with a money-back guarantee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was in the realm of restoring the beautiful figure that things really got kooky and yet oddly familiar. If I may quote at length from an ad for a miracle nostrum: “If your stomach is sour and filled with 46 gases, your head aches or you are bilious, nervous, dizzy, half-sick, your tongue coated, your thirty feet of bowels clogged, don't wait! Simply take a teaspoonful of delicious Syrup of Figs tonight.” Another potion, Tyrrell's JBL Cascade, promised to cure “the ills of constipation, this blockage of the system of terribly poisonous waste.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ah, those Edwardian quacks! How could they have believed such things? And yet, how full of the same voodoo are the diet books that fill the shelves in the post-Christmas period? Wheat is an addictive substance akin to opiates, according to the mega-selling Wheat Belly diet books. (Though you likely won't get murdered when you take your giant belly out to score a fix of Wonder Bread.) There are foods that are so full of “yang” energy that they lead to aggression and hypermaterialism, according to the MILF Diet. And no, if you don't know what a MILF is, I'm not going to tell you. Don't ask your mother, either. The MILF Diet is not to be confused with the Mom Diet, which, when I think about it, worked for me: When I gave birth to a 10-pound child, I found I'd miraculously lost 10 pounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe it's the narcissicism of each generation to think it's cornered the market on self-improvement, although we only ever repeat the past. Modern diet books are all about “elimination,” “shedding,” “detoxing.” Like the Edwardian texts, they seem to view the human digestive tract like the spaceship from Alien, its dank corners concealing grotesque surprises around every bend. Health can only be achieved, writes the author of The Beauty Detox Solution, “when we have cleansed toxic material, the new sludge and the old sludge that accumulate constantly.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the contrary, doctors will tell you that, if you're a reasonably healthy person, the main thing in your intestine is intestine, unless you've been doing silly things with snakes, in which case no diet book will save you. This will not stop billions of fellow humans from lining up to buy Gwyneth Paltrow's new cookbook, Doctor G's Purgative Elixir for the Houseproud Hausfrau. I lie: It's called It's All Good (although the book contains a recipe for hummus tartine, so how good can it possibly be?). Ms Paltrow's recipes are based on an elimination diet – no dairy, meat, sugar, wheat, alcohol, coffee, joy or eggs. The cookbook is out in April. Get in line now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's somewhat comforting to think that we're fighting the exact same battles 100 years on. Though I'm a little sad that the Edwardians didn't know that moderation in red wine is good for you, or that, as an extensive study showed this week, being slightly overweight could actually help extend your lifespan. Middling chubsters should not greet this news with too much joy, for the Grim Reaper will find us all in the end: His <span class="companylink">Google</span> Map includes both Fat Street and Skinny Alley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'd like to ask someone from 100 years ago if they had any joy from their Millburn's Heart and Nerve Pills, their Purgen, their Pape's Diapepsin, but they're all gone, hefty and slim alike, and their resolutions with them.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A column published Saturday on fad diets referred to an ad published in 1913 in The Globe and Mail. In fact, the ad was in The Globe. The Globe and Mail began publishing in 1936 when The Globe merged with The Mail and Empire.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘Lottery.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roger Ronnberg has heard the word in every language of the hockey world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This night, moments after his Swedish team defeated the hometown favourites in a breathtaking 3-2 semi-final game decided in a shootout, it comes out first in Russian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ronnberg requires no translation to know where Russian coach Mikhail Yarnakov is headed with this one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In this lottery we lost,” the Russian coach says with a philosophical shrug. “One team goes on to the gold medal. One team goes on to play for bronze. It's a lottery.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No, Ronnberg wants to say. It is not a lottery. But instead he responds diplomatically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We try to prepare for this,” he says in the coaches' formal press conference, “because in every world tournament I have been to this is how you win the tournament or how you lose the tournament. It always comes down to [a shootout] and so we prepare for that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He talks about how the Swedish “scouted” the Russian shooters in the quarter-final match when the spunky Swiss team also took Russia to a shootout, and lost. The Swedes knew who would be chosen and had a good sense of what they would do. Nail Yakupov, for example, the NHL's No. 1 draft pick last summer when he was chosen by the <span class="companylink">Edmonton Oilers</span>, used exactly the same move against the Swiss that he tried on Swedish goaltender Niklas Lundstrom – a quick, low shot to the five-hole – and failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We knew what they will do,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later, in a private chat, Ronnberg says what he bit his tongue on when sitting beside Yarnakov in the news conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“First of all,” he says. “I don't think it's a lottery. That's a mindset, but it's not a lottery. You can practise the penalty shots. You should take it more seriously. It's one of the things that a coach must do, I think. You have to prepare the players. You have to help them, give them tools, help them own the confidence that they need in the penalty shots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think it's a coachable skill.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is an opinion slow to reach other hockey worlds, the NHL included. The shootout has been part of NHL play since the league returned from its previous lockout, in 2005. It was first considered as far back as the 1994 all-star game – a fan-entertainment idea pushed for by Michael Eisner, then owner of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, and Marcel Aubut, owner of the Quebec Nordiques – but the league was slow to adopt it and has never truly embraced it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purists say it is an individual skill deciding a team sport. There are even complicated mathematical arguments available to prove it's nothing but a crapshoot. In other words, exactly as Yarnakov argued: a lottery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No, Ronnberg says. It is not a crapshoot and coaches who buy into that are merely seeking a scapegoat that allows them not to take responsibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a mindset,” he says. “If you think it's a lottery you won't coach it, you won't practise it. But if you think it's a part of the game that you have to take care of, then you have to take responsibility for it, too.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sweden, Ronnberg says, learned this lesson the hard way two years ago in Buffalo, when it let a semi-final game slip out of its hands by allowing a late Russian goal to force overtime and then had a shootout decide the game 4-3 in favour of the Russians. The Russians went on to win the gold medal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That was the lesson for us,” the Swedish coach says. “We hadn't prepared the shooters that time. We just put them on the ice and one guy wasn't ready. And another guy, he had a [shootout] shot that he didn't care to use at that moment, because we hadn't coached him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So that was my fault. I could have blamed the lottery, but we learned a lesson that time, that we have to coach them, that we have to prepare them for this moment.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year in Calgary, the Swedes again went to a shootout in the semi-final, this time against Finland. And they were prepared – winning 3-2 and moving on to play Russia for the gold medal, which the Swedes won dramatically in overtime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“World juniors for us three years in a row it's penalty shots,” Ronnberg says. “We do everything right in the games, but it's the penalty shots in the end that decide winning and losing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, he says, they were even better prepared. The goaltender, Lundstrom, knew what he had to do, what he had to watch for, and none of the Russians could score.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it came down to one Swede who had to score, Ronnberg knew he would be sending out Sebastian Collberg, an 18-year-old who plays for Frolunda HC in the Swedish elite league and is a draft prospect of the <span class="companylink">Montreal Canadiens</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why Collberg? Well, he has the skills required. But that, Ronnberg says, is only one part of it. Perhaps not even the most important.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We know he has a good penalty shot,” Ronnberg says. “But he also has the mentality to be the hero in those situations, so he is really enjoying being out there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That is the most important part with that kid. You have to love to be there. You have to love to be at the centre. You have to love to be there, to have the confidence to be that type of player. And he is. He showed it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is an interesting perspective, but whether Yarnakov is right that the shootout is a lottery, or Ronnberg is correct in saying it is as “coachable” as a breakout pattern or a penalty kill, the question still remains: Does he like the idea that important hockey games should be decided by a shootout?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He smiles. “When you win,” he says, “you like it.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are you too short for your weight? I know how you feel. Are you bothered by that squishy roll of flesh above your jeans? Me too. Are you depressed by your lack of self-control? Of course you are! It's time to get a grip on those love handles once and for all. We're going to hit the gym three times a week and trade in our chocolate-coated biscotti for rye husks.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And we will succeed. Maybe even until the end of January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Tis the season of self-reproach and fresh resolve. The trouble is that New Year's resolutions don't work. I know this because I've been breaking them for 50 years. Even so, I can't stop myself. Last week, I woke up in the the night vowing I'd join the Y and take up swimming for an hour every day. The next morning, I went on the Internet and found out how much it would cost to join the Y, and checked the swimming schedule. In my mind, I was already in the pool, vigorously stroking away and getting lean and fit and vital. How fabulous! I conveniently forgot that I've joined the Y three times before, and that my cost per lap swum is higher than I care to calculate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why are our good resolutions so hard to sustain? Why do we so often set out to do what's good for us, and wind up noshing on Timbits? The reason is ego depletion. This phrase was coined by social psychologist Roy Baumeister, who argues that willpower – the active self – is a limited resource. The more you exercise your self-control on one task, the less you have for the next. This is a big subject among experimental psychologists, who have subjected hundreds of university students to tests involving chocolate-chip cookies and radishes. Researchers have found that willpower is like a mental muscle. It gets fatigued. There's only so much of it you can muster before you get tired out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turns out that you use the same muscle of self-control for all kinds of unrelated tasks – meeting deadlines, battling traffic, avoiding French fries, being nice to your in-laws, spending an extra five minutes on the treadmill. By the end of a demanding day, your willpower has been depleted, which is why you go home and kick the cat, or eat half a pint of Häagen-Dazs, or yell at your husband to pick up his stupid flaming socks. (You may think you're being helpful, but you're not. I once made the mistake of asking my husband to make a New Year's resolution for me. “Stop nagging me to pick up my socks,” he said.) This doesn't mean you can't improve yourself. You can. But it's hard. Ego depletion explains why I was able to exert a massive effort to stop smoking, then promptly gained the 20 extra pounds that have stuck to me to this day. Every so often, I manage to lose a pound or two, but they always come right back. By now I am grateful just to hold the line. Moderation is good, but diets are evil. What I really need to do is start swimming!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Swimming is just part of my extensive self-improvement program, which includes goals both large and small. These include: Clear out basement, learn to draw, floss regularly, stop wasting time on the Internet. Visit my mother-in-law more often. Stop nagging husband. Try out new recipes, finish Moby Dick, spend more time with friends, keep my desk neater, be more diligent about answering e-mail, update will, keep car clean, cut out booze except on weekends (hah!), volunteer with Food Bank, achieve moral perfection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You see the problem here. As Prof. Baumeister points out in his book on willpower (called Willpower, co-authored with John Tierney), the problem isn't my lack of goals. The problem is that I have too many of them. Because I have only one supply of willpower, there's not enough to go around. All my different resolutions compete with one another. Each time I try to achieve one, the likelihood goes down that I'll achieve any of the others. The only thing I can be sure of is that, by about the middle of February, I'll be brooding on what a miserable failure I am.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or, as Oprah says, “How did I let this happen again?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is some good news, though. If willpower is like a muscle, it can be trained. According to the professor, creating better habits in some areas can help you improve in others. Keeping your bed made and your desk tidy not only makes you happier, but also provides useful practice in self-regulation. Order and discipline in little things can make it easier to accomplish big things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is also helpful to arrange your life to avoid problem situations. For example, if you want to avoid eating ice cream, never have it in the fridge. Always remember that cheating on your spouse will only end in tears. Also, there is never any reason to eat French fries, unless they are the kind of skinny, crisp, fresh-cut frites that come with homemade mayonnaise, in which case you should have as many as you want. It's amazing how much easier you can make your life with a few simple rules like these. As for exercise, it's like sex. It's generally more fun when you do it with somebody else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personally, I think weight loss is highly overrated. I'd rather spend my limited supplies of willpower in more productive ways. If all the efforts we waste trying to lose weight were unleashed on improving the world instead, we'd probably have global peace by now. Besides, now that high-waisted jeans are coming back, you can largely avoid that ugly jelly-roll look. Muffin-tops of the world, unite! We have far, far better things to do.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief Theresa Spence of Attawapiskat, who is in the third week of a hunger strike, should be content, for the time being, that Prime Minister Stephen Harper will meet with a delegation of native leaders, including herself – 13 days before the anniversary of the Crown-First Nations Gathering on Jan. 24, 2012. The prospect of such gatherings becoming a regular annual event is desirable in itself, even though Chief Spence's regrettable moral-pressure tactic may have been a factor in Mr. Harper's decision.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief Spence's current intention of waiting for Jan. 11, the day of the “working meeting” to follow up on last year's Crown Gathering, before she returns to a normal diet, is not praiseworthy. It is not consistent with her previous demand for a meeting with the Prime Minister, which has in effect been granted. On the one hand, she was gracious enough to express herself to be “overjoyed” at the announcement of the meeting. On the other, some of her statements have invited inferences that she will not return to solid food unless the outcome of the meeting is to her satisfaction. That would be to up the ante unreasonably.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harper said on Friday – while announcing an automotive innovation fund at Oakville, Ont. – that the government had already been planning such discussions with Shawn A-in-chut Atleo, the National Chief of the <span class="companylink">Assembly of First Nations</span>, in November. But the timing of the gathering next week unmistakably shows that Chief Spence's actions have had an effect. It would make sense for her to remain in Ottawa for the event, but not to continue to live on fish broth and little else, on Victoria Island in the Ottawa River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, one day's meeting will not solve the problems of the first nations communities, and Mr. Harper will not and should not accede to all the AFN's proposals or demands. But there is a great degree of common interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plight of Attawapiskat has particular significance, both practical and symbolic. Its remoteness and small population make it difficult to thrive there, but the resources of Northern Ontario ought to make success there possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fulfilment of aboriginal treaty rights should eventually lead to economically viable Indian communities. Good management practices and accountability would lead to solid, warm houses and drinkable running water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For their part, members of first nations communities should welcome the federal government's Bill C-45, which would facilitate new revenues from leaseholds on what are, ultimately, their own lands. There is no need to take antagonism for granted – and Chief Spence should start eating soon.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But first Mr. Garneau kindly agreed to answer some questions that I considered pressing, via e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tabatha Southey: Canadians pay some of the highest rates for wireless service in the developed world. I've shopped around, bundled, unbundled, then knitted tiny bonnets and practically swaddled my services, and yet I still pay almost as much for wireless and phone for my family of three as to heat my reasonably sized home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You say you'd like to see more competition in the telecommunications sector. How would your plan affect the average Canadian family – in space?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marc Garneau: Well, for starters, I'd eliminate roaming charges for all space travellers. Let's face it, space families deserve a break. Truth is, all Canadians are paying too much. These things are not luxuries for texting teens, but an increasingly vital part of operating businesses of every size – part of being competitive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southey: Canadian Chris Hadfield is living on the International Space Station. I see he's on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>. My question is, Can he only get Canadian Netflix?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garneau: It's getting better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southey: Canada has a high rate of youth unemployment. Should Canada address this problem by sending more of our young, unskilled people into space?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garneau: We all know a few young people we'd like to send into space. Young people know young people they'd like to send to space. But what we really need is to focus on getting them Earth jobs. If we want a competitive work force in the future, one way to get young people into the job market is to provide incentives to employers who hire them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We also need to tap into that other strength in our work force, newly arrived immigrants who bring skills to Canada but have trouble getting accredited to Canadian standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We can extend the Canada Student Loan program to them and assist them with internships so that they'll gain a foothold in the job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southey: Recently, astronomers discovered what some are calling a new “super-Earth” in the zone of a nearby star that has the right conditions to support life. If it turns out to have life, should Canada have its own embassy there, or share one with the U.K.?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garneau: Sharing our embassy? Only a space cadet would come up with that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southey: Can you streamline our tax system to the point where it is actually weightless?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garneau: That's a tall order. Right now the Income Tax Act weighs a ton. Putting it on a diet is certainly an option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southey: When I take the train to Montreal, it's really slow. Do you see any solution to this?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garneau: Faster trains?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southey: So, no transporter?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garneau: Sigh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southey : Should we diversify our energy exports, away from the U.S. and toward space?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garneau: Please, could we talk about something other than space?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southey: Okay. What is the main challenge for sonar-wave propagation in shallow water?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garneau: Well, at-sea experimental data and simulation results show that acoustic, normal-mode coupling induced by internal solitons could be an important loss mechanism for shallow-water sound propagation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southey: Damn. I knew you'd get that one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garneau: You pick a few things up in the Navy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southey: How does it feel to be in the Hockey Hall of Fame?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garneau: I think you'd have to ask Ken Dryden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southey: Right. Growing up at 24 Sussex, did you ever imagine that one day you would be seeking to be prime minister yourself?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garneau : That's Justin Trudeau.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many new restaurants (Flying Pig, Espana, Nicli Antica, Sardine Can), reservations are simply not accepted. Old-fashioned diners may moan about this increasingly common first-come, first-serve policy. I don't understand their whining. Seriously, when does the average Vancouverite ever make plans more than 24 hours in advance? (Ask anyone who works at the box office for a local performing arts company.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We do, however, appreciate that Café Trendy will jot down your cell number and call when a table is free instead of forcing everyone to wait in line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hop up and take a seat. Yes, these are indeed hay bales covered with cowhides. What an ingenious way of pushing urban-farmhouse chic forward now that every last scrap of splintered barn board from here to Coquitlam has already been reclaimed (blame Oakwood Bistro, Fable, Wildebeest, etc., etc.).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking for a printed menu? How quaint. At Café Trendy, the menus are custom iPad programs with nifty interactive features. Wondering about the provenance of the pork tenderloin? Tap on the links to watch a video of the daily special when it was still a living, snorting Berkshire pig feeding on milk and molasses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Café Trendy could have gone the other way, with handwritten menus scrawled across their tables' brown butcher paper. If anything, 2013 promises to be a year of polarized extremes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May we suggest a cocktail? Yes, it is meant to be swigged from the bottle. Glasses are so 2012. Ripped off from, er, inspired by Jamie Boudreau, the self-proclaimed Cocktail Whisperer at Canon Whiskey and Bitters Emporium in Seattle, Café Trendy's premixed craft cocktails are individually packaged in 375 ml mickeys. No, you can't take the bottle to go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dinner begins with raw turnips – wilted leaves and dirt-encrusted roots still attached – buried in foamy skyr, sprinkled with milk-wafer crumble and hazelnut soil, presented on a bed of smoking fir tips.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Haven't heard of skyr? You will. This thick, strained sheep's milk (first seen locally at Wildebeest) is just one of many Scandinavian-style curds and whey borrowed from new Nordic cuisine, the big culinary trend in Vancouver this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next up is bone marrow, naturally. If you haven't yet heard, bone marrow is the new bacon. The gelatinous tissue spooned from large bones has recently appeared on so many menus (Uva, Wildebeest, Le Parisien, Flying Pig, Oakwood Canadian Bistro, Pourhouse, among others) it has been difficult to keep count.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This being Vancouver, where no soup, salad or dessert has ever been spared an Asian-flecked tweak, Café Trendy serves its panko-breaded, pan-seared marrow between soft, squishy bao buns with a squeeze of sriracha mayo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I advise you to steer clear of the steak. Not just at Café Trendy, but at any restaurant that doesn't specialize in premium cuts. After last fall's E. coli outbreak at an Alberta processing plant, many Canadian food sellers have voluntarily stopped needling their steaks for tenderization. The result? Tougher meat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For dessert? A carrot. But not just any old carrot. This garden-fresh heirloom baby carrot is caramelized, served on a bed of hazelnut praline with dollop of white chocolate mousse. As seen everywhere from Copenhagen's Noma (Jerusalem artichoke ice cream) to Wildebeest (chocolate sorbet with diced celery root), vegetables are taking centre stage in the final course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you don't enjoy this new sweet veggie trend, you could always order an appetizer at the end the meal (refer above to skyr) and your dessert as a salad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't even bother asking for an espresso. Espresso beverages are so grungy Third Wave (which, according to serious coffee connoisseurs, peaked in Seattle about the same time that Kurt Cobain died and <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> went mainstream).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Café Trendy, the coffee is a single-origin Kenyan peaberry – aged, lightly roasted and steeped in a four-minute pour-over. Yes, it is supposed to be the colour of weak tea and taste slightly sour with a blueberry finish. Don't like it? Go to Blenz.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finance Minister Jim Flaherty's warning last year to Canadian bank executives that they should not “compete to the bottom on interest rates,” as he says he put it to them, was given a new dimension this week. Documents obtained by The Globe and Mail under Access to Information laws indicate that the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> is equally concerned that competition to sign up loan and mortgage customers is helping to increase consumer debt loads that are already uncomfortably high. The concern is understandable but, if anything, Ottawa and the central bank should be encouraging competition in the financial sector, not questioning it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The documents included research that found that neighbourhoods with more bank branches in them tended to have “looser lending standards and … greater bankruptcies.” The focus was on the mortgage and housing market, which is one of the few areas of the financial sector where the average Canadian retail bank customer can hope to negotiate his bank costs. Ask your bank for a discount on ATM fees, account fees, credit card rates and the rates for lines of credit, and you will be met with a puzzled look. Mortgage rates are different; most banks will discount their posted rates to attract business, especially if potential customers can walk across the street to a competitor. The <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span>'s own research from winter 2010-11, posted online, found that the more banks there are in your neighbourhood, the better chance you have of getting a lower rate, and vice versa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flaherty's worries about Canadians' debt loads are justified. Canadians, too, are worried; recent surveys have shown they are focused on building up savings and paying down debt. For homeowners, one of the quickest ways of doing the latter is getting a better mortgage rate. Competition is a proven way for achieving this. If Ottawa and the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> are worried that low interest rates are attracting people to mortgages they can't afford, they should look for solutions other than discouraging a market that benefits the vast majority of consumers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a woman in my 30s with a failed marriage under my belt, I'm in no position to judge Kate Winslet – and yet I do.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The actress, as you probably now know unless you are lucky enough to have had your Wi-Fi disconnected, took a third husband just before Christmas, the fantastically named Ned RocknRoll, nephew to Sir Richard Branson and a “marketing specialist” with the space-travel arm of his uncle's vast empire. She did this without bothering to tell her parents or new in-laws and less than two years after her last split, from the director Sam Mendes, her second husband with whom she has a second child (the first being from her first husband, the director Jim Threapleton.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I know it's not nice to judge, but when it comes to Winslet, I can't help myself. This third marriage just seems like such a waste of a reasonably good public image. Until her recent nuptials, I saw Winslet in what I imagine is exactly the light in which she hopes to be seen. When I watched her winning an Oscar or swooning in a perfume ad, I thought: Now there's a talented, hard-working, down-to-earth young woman who's made some mistakes but is basically trying to do the reasonable thing in a chronically unreasonable world. In essence, I imagined her as the person she seemed to be in that <span class="companylink">American Express</span> commercial, the one where she's walking jauntily through the streets of London with a takeout coffee, reminiscing about all the crazy parts she's played, and then says, “My real life doesn't need any more drama. That's why my card is <span class="companylink">American Express</span>.” The message seems to be that Visa and <span class="companylink">MasterCard</span> might make you prone to bipolar disorder, but I digress – the point is I liked Winslet because she seemed kind of regular and sane despite her hyper-glamorous, clearly insane life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now that the celebrity-gossip sites are debating whether she plans to become Mrs. RocknRoll (as her husband's first wife actually did), I feel ever so slightly betrayed. I understand when people fail – mostly because I'm sympathetic. Heck, I've done it myself. But what I have a much harder time understanding is why people set themselves up for failure, especially in ways that reveal a shocking lack of self-awareness. For instance, if you are a person who has been divorced twice by your mid-thirties, perhaps you might think about hanging back a few years before getting married for the third time, especially when there are children involved? Surely the normal argument for rushing into marriage – that it's the conventional thing to do, and once you do it, people will respect your relationship – is nullified by the time you're a 37-year-old twice-divorced movie star cavorting with your new boyfriend on Necker Island? At that point people respect you more for not getting married since it shows you are capable of learning from your mistakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's funny how conventions can come full circle in this way – that the institutions we once relied on to scrub away our sins can now actually sully us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take expectant parents Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. Their future offspring – officially dubbed “the Kimye baby” by the Internet populace – is the biggest celebrity breeding news since the Royal fetus. My first reaction upon reading of the Kimye baby on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> was delight. Not at the news of the baby itself, but for Kanye and Kim having the good grace to start their weird little spectacle of a family without putting us all through the spectre of another doomed celebrity wedding. Of all people, I thought, Kardashian has learned from her mistakes. It's a Hollywood miracle! Then I found out the reason why they won't be getting married is that Kim is still awaiting a divorce trial date and will thus still be legally married to her first husband when the child is born. Her first husband, in case you've been living under a rock or had your wi-fi disconnected, is Kris Humphries, a professional basketball player to whom she was happily, publicly married for exactly 27 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, I've got no problem with any of this messy-personal-life stuff – as I mentioned before, I'm in no position to judge – but it does make me sad when seemingly sane famous people (like Ryan Reynolds and Kate Winslet) start jumping on the marriage-addiction bandwagon. Surely now that no one much cares whether anyone's married any more we could leave such antics to the past? While Liz Taylor, Joan Collins and Liza Minnelli might have had an excuse for dragging a string of husbands behind them like a collection of filthy feather boas, Winslet most certainly does not. Maybe next time she'll do the respectable thing – and learn to live happily in sin.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The options for aerobic exercise during the Canadian winter can seem grim: slipping and sliding along icy streets, pedalling nowhere under the fluorescent lights of the gym, and so on. But there's a better option, one that, recent research suggests, actually offers unique advantages compared to the alternatives. When it snows, why not make for the cross-country ski trails?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STAY YOUNG</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers in Sweden and at <span class="companylink">Ball State University</span> in Indiana assembled two groups of octogenarian men. All of the volunteers were healthy, lived independently and were capable of completing a vigorous exercise test to exhaustion. The difference was that one group comprised lifelong cross-country skiers who trained four to six times a week, while the other group didn't do any formal exercise beyond the activities of daily living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Predictably, the skiers were in better shape than the non-skiers. But the magnitude of the differences is jaw-dropping. The various test results, to be published in a forthcoming issue of the Journal of Applied Physiology, show that the skiers had approximately twice the cardiovascular and muscular fitness of the untrained group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even compared to previous studies of lifelong endurance athletes in their 80s, the skiers were about 40-per-cent fitter, suggesting that the full-body workout provided by cross-country skiing is uniquely effective. In fact, their fitness “places them in the lowest all-cause mortality risk category for men of any age,” the researchers point out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results are consistent with earlier studies of cross-country skiers: An analysis of 73,000 men and women who participated over a 10-year period in Vasaloppet, an annual long-distance race series in Sweden, found that they were less than half as likely to die during the follow-up period as matched controls from the general population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, the untrained subjects were perilously close to the “prognostic exercise capacity” that's associated with an inability to live independently. The message: Good genes can help you live a long life, but if you want to enjoy those later years, go skiing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">USE YOUR ARMS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big difference between cross-country skiing and other endurance exercise, like running and cycling, is that your upper body plays a big role. How big? A forthcoming study in the Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports offers some clues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers tested 16 elite Norwegian skiers, half of the group male and the other half female, in four different exercise protocols, each requiring different levels of upper-body contribution. The most arm-intensive activity was double-poling, where the propulsion is provided entirely by the arms. Next was “G3 skating,” the freestyle technique in which skiers double pole with every stride. Then came the classic skiing style, with skis kept parallel. And the final exercise was running, which doesn't use the arms at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal of the study was to understand how the male skiers' greater upper-body strength would affect performance in the different techniques. Sure enough, the men were comparatively better in the most arm-</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">dependent tasks: They were 20-per-cent faster at double-poling, 17-per-cent faster at skating, 14-per-cent faster at classic style, and just 12-per-cent faster while running. The results suggest that you should vary your technique on different types of terrain in order to maximize your workout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CLIMB HARD</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The occasional steep uphill on a cross-country course is a necessary evil. How else do you earn the downhill that follows? You can turn your skis perpendicular to the hill and side-step your way up, or even take your skis right off. But the quickest solution – like pulling a band-aid off – is to angle your skis slightly outward and herringbone up at top speed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clambering up a hill in this style is like a miniature sprint, and it will send your heart rate shooting upward. That's a good thing: Researchers have shown that including some short bursts of intense activity while exercising can produce a much more effective workout. It's possible to insert similar bursts into other types of workouts, like running or cardio machines at the gym, but a rolling cross-country ski loop integrates them naturally, since you'll slide backward if you don't keep pushing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, cross-country skiing isn't without drawbacks. For city dwellers in particular, it can be difficult to find good trails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More importantly, it's a strictly limited-time option. Come spring, you'll be back to your usual workout routines. So ski while you can.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alex Hutchinson blogs about exercise research at sweatscience.runnersworld.com. His latest book is Which Comes First, Cardio or Weights?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">******</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clambering up a steep hill provides a high-intensity burst of exertion during cross-country skiing. Researchers in Europe analyzed how elite skiers optimize their herringbone ascent:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skis angled 25 to 30 degrees outward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weight on the inside of the foot for leverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quick steps to avoid sliding backward, with no forward glide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Poles are angled slightly backward and kept in contact with the ground for longer than usual.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A man walks into a crowded restaurant with a loaded handgun – but this is not a joke. It's a Canadian constitutional case from Surrey, B.C. The mandatory minimum penalty is three years. But the judge in the case is threatening to strike down the mandatory minimums, finding them arbitrary. They are anything but arbitrary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The case of Glenn Sheck and his Glock 9mm semi-automatic is a challenge to those Canadians – including those who write in this space – who question some mandatory minimum penalties, and yet espouse strong gun controls. Adam Lanza brought along a Glock 9mm handgun when he shot and killed 20 children and six adults at an elementary school in Connecticut last month. It is not a big leap from Canada's strong gun laws to a tough mandatory minimum for illegal possession.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why did B.C. Provincial Court Judge James Bahen call the penalty arbitrary? Because the maximum penalty on a less serious “summary conviction” offence is just one year; Judge Bahen found the gap between the one-year maximum and the three-year minimum for a more serious offence to be arbitrary. It's much better understood as a safety valve for unusual cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take an Ontario case in which a former provincial cabinet minister, John Snobelen, carelessly did not register a handgun, which he had no access to (his ex-wife had hidden it). Three years in prison would have been absurd. Charged with a summary conviction offence, he received an absolute discharge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when the Crown doesn't use the safety valve, the system can come crashing down – as in another Ontario case, in which an otherwise law-abiding man, Leroy Smickle, foolishly picked up someone's gun in his cousin's private home and tried to photograph himself holding it, at the very moment that police armed with a search warrant were preparing to forcibly enter that home. In that case, a judge had good reason to find that three years was a grossly disproportionate penalty. The Smickle case suggests a need to give judges some wiggle room for exceptional cases. (The Smickle ruling is under appeal.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judge Bahen called the three years in Mr. Sheck's case “harsh,” though not unconstitutionally so. But harshness is exactly the point. Canadians don't want people walking into crowded restaurants with loaded guns.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democracy can only thrive in a free society in which every person's vote counts equally, and where elections are honest. But newspapers regularly report allegations of shady dealings – be it between mayors and lobbyists, a premier with conflicts of interest, ministers who use the public purse for private benefit.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We need to get money – especially of ill-begotten provenance – out of politics. In the United States, since 2010, the Supreme Court has allowed corporations to supply unlimited election financing. This means that Congress is now even more likely to be an elite of politicians backed by deep pockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Wall Street and other powerful lobby groups pay large sums to finance elections, is it any wonder none of the big names behind the 2008 financial disaster are in jail?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We need good people to run for office but the democratic process today does not attract the best and the brightest. Many good people are deterred by attack ads that besmirch hard-earned reputations. The mantra of the demagogues is: “If you lack a good argument, attack your opponent's character.” Weak candidates can be kept afloat by infusions of cash from financially powerful benefactors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We need governments that do what is right, not just what is expedient. The euro zone crisis is partly the result of overspending by governments seeking to stay elected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada, we tend to think we're immune to these problems. But here, too, investment laws favour banks and other financial institutions over individual investors. Lawyers and accountants seeking to extract favourable treatment for their firms have infiltrated securities commissions. It is time to remove the “welcome mats” that foster the too-close ties between firms and regulators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What can be done to safeguard our democracies? I have spent much of my life promoting good governance in the corporate boardroom. Here are some lessons I've learned that might be applied to our democracies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Protect and enforce: We need to protect whistle blowers and strictly enforce codes of integrity, imposing huge punishments on offenders – including banning them forever from the civil service, or from ever again being elected. I lose no sleep over the so-called tough penalties imposed on mayors who don't understand the meaning of conflict of interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Get incentives right: We know that economic performance is enhanced when taxation systems promote work and saving, and not when they feed the illusion of a social paradise based on excessive spending or government debt. The welfare of citizens is enhanced when essential social services are targeted on the needy, not the greedy. The same is true in politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our politics work best when the interests of politicians are aligned with the public good, and this demands institutions that encourage people to go into politics for the right reasons, and to serve the public, not themselves or lobby groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too many politicians think ethics means getting away with whatever you can within the law– and sometimes sidestepping it. That is not good enough. Politicians set the tone for citizens. That is why they should be held to a higher standard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plato had it right: He said that the greatest punishment for being unwilling to rule is being ruled by someone worse than oneself. This is what makes people of good character step forward. “In a city of good men,” Plato mused, people would “probably vie with each other in order not to rule.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a New Year dawns, I'm reminded of Alexander Pope's immortal words: “Hope springs eternal in the human breast.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My three wishes for Canada were the same in both 2011 and 2012. Despite being disappointed on my hopes for past years, I take heart that 2013 may bring progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first was that private sector efficiency and innovation would be introduced into our teetering, bureaucratic government-run health care system. As patients suffer on ever-growing wait lists, Canada remains the only OECD country where it's against the law for patients to pay for their own health care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regrettably, 2012 saw a step backward as British Columbia launched court action to shut down Dr. Brian Day's private clinics, which have provided relief for hundreds of patients, while reducing public system costs and shortening waiting lists. The reality is that health care is devouring an ever larger share of provincial revenues. If we don't act now, education and other social programs will face huge cutbacks. My hope for 2013 is that politicians find the vision and the courage to grant freedom of choice to patients and to health-care providers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My second wish was that Canadian universities move beyond their dysfunctional “academic independence” paradigm and reallocate funding to fields critical to our country's economic future. Yet in 2012, the “skills gap” saw increasing numbers of unfilled jobs co-exist with high youth unemployment, while growing numbers of university graduates worked in low-skills jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of university graduates turning to jobs-focused colleges increased, meaning taxpayers are paying to educate students not once, but twice. A report by the <span class="companylink">Canadian Council of Chief Executives</span> concluded that this educational mismatch is causing the country to fall behind in the global skills race. A Canadian Chamber of Commerce report cited a “desperate labour shortage” as the No. 1 obstacle to the growth of Canadian companies. Meanwhile, OECD data show that Canada has one of the world's highest rates of university attendance, but our schools rank second-last in producing graduates able to find high-skill-level employment. And every year, failure to prioritize funding of in-demand skills means that thousands of qualified applicants are turned away from engineering, information technology, medicine and other skills-short fields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My third wish was for our provinces to take concrete steps to get their finances under control. Yet, once again, debt and deficits grew in every province except Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador. With a per-capita debt of more than $21,000, Quebec incurred a deficit of $10-billion despite federal equalization and other transfers totalling $17-billion. Ontario, whose debt increased by $16-billion to more than a quarter-of-a-trillion dollars, is now a “have-not” province receiving $3-billion in equalization. That leaves just British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland to fund equalization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent study by Don Mackinnon for the Frontier Centre presents a compelling conclusion that equalization dooms its recipients to economic dysfunction and dependency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether it's the failing economies of southern Europe or of these provinces, it's clear that government debt cannot be contained in the presence of unsustainable social programs combined with incentive-killing subsidies. My hope is that 2013 will mark the beginning of an end to our country's counterproductive and economically debilitating equalization system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Internationally, my hope for 2012 was that the so-called Arab Spring in the Middle East wouldn't “unleash a tyranny of the majority wherein the rights of ethnic and religious minorities are undefended.” Sadly, the introduction of Egypt's new Islamic-slanted constitution does exactly that. My hope for 2013 is that leaders of nascent democracies come to understand that true democracy means not just the right to vote, but the right to freedom of religion and to freedom from ethnic persecution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hope springs eternal, for without hope, we have nothing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday, January 11, 2013</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province of Quebec projects a deficit of $1.5-billion for the 2012-13 fiscal year. A column published Monday suggested incorrectly that the deficit in Quebec was $10-billion.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judd Apatow's new movie This Is 40 depicts a couple trying to reboot their marriage, having reached the unofficial “over-the-hill” mark and realizing that their relationship has become almost entirely perfunctory. At best. Husband and wife obsess over each other's faults and only somewhat-jokingly fantasize about each other's deaths. In one particularly memorable scene, Pete asks Deb to examine his butt, while she wonders whether they might hold onto just “a shred” of mystery in their relationship. It is gross and hilarious and perfectly illustrative of the place where intimacy and romance diverge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am happy to report that I've never been asked to diagnose anyone's rectal maladies, nor have I fantasized about how I might off John, my boyfriend of 13 years. Still, I could definitely relate to the film's central conundrum: That we often put our best selves out into the world, while saving our brattiest, least patient, least fun and most critical iterations of self for the one person we love the most. Would I ever, for example, freak out on a friend because she was late to pick me up, or nag a colleague when he didn't do exactly what I wanted him to do right when I asked him? Of course not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The notion that someone out there loves you “warts and all” is romantic in its own way, I suppose, but show those warts often enough and the person across the breakfast table may end up viewing you as a witch. With this in mind, I decided to go a week without criticizing or nagging John. And see if he even noticed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How to be a better, better half</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While keeping the specifics of Operation: Nix the Nitpicking to myself, I began the week by asking John whether he found me to be particularly critical. His take was that I am pretty supportive, but can get controlling and naggish when things aren't going exactly my way (I added “be more flexible” to the week's agenda). I should mention that this experiment played out over my Christmas holiday, which I spent in Florida. On the one hand, what is there to complain about when you're on holiday? But on the other, this meant 10 days of spending pretty much 24/7 together. And travelling, which can bring out the crankypants in all of us, right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not going to list the tiny complaints and critiques that I held back, first off because (like the wife in the movie) my boyfriend would appreciate maintaining a shred of privacy, and also because the specific nature of nitpicks is not nearly as relevant as the fact that I usually feel justified in making them. No one conflict is particularly significant, but death by a thousand paper cuts has put many relationships into the morgue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an article about the negative effects of minor, inter-relationship mud-slinging, Dr. Leon Seltzer explains that, “the moment we feel sufficiently secure in our partner's bond to us is the moment we take our gloves off.” Our actions, says Seltzer, become dictated by the demands of our own egos rather than the warm, fuzzy feelings we have for the other person. When we feel like our needs aren't being met, sometimes the knee-jerk reaction is to become more critical of the other person's shortcomings, both relevant (tendency to forget about plans) and otherwise (tendency to start playing guitar just when we are supposed to be leaving the house).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life's a beach when you don't kvetch</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I confess that I thought this challenge was going to be tough – breaking bad habits always is, and besides how would we ever get things done without my necessary reminders (those comments that John files under incessant nagging)? But I was wrong – cutting out the kvetching was not hard at all. Not allowing myself to get worked up over tiny things was actually sort of relaxing and yet another example of the whole mind-over-matter philosophy that pops up in so many of these weekly challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seltzer explains that when we critique and complain about a partner's behaviour, what we are really doing is trying to mould the other person into what we want them to be. One day at the beach I began pestering John to go for a swim as soon as we got there. I wanted to go in, so that must be the ideal sequence of events. And of course, a dip in the ocean is more fun with a partner in crime, but putting on the bossy boots is probably not the best way to get there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other night I asked whether he had noticed my exemplary girlfriend behaviour over the week. He had not, but said that he had had a really fun trip. I guess that's sort of the point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next challenge</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I really want to get healthier this year. Besides a multivitamin, are there any other supplements I should take?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A multivitamin is a good start, but keep in mind it only serves to reinforce a healthy diet, not replace it. That said, I routinely recommend a multivitamin and mineral supplement to my healthy clients to offset nutrient gaps in their diet, especially if they're following a lower-calorie diet for weight loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides dieters, there are other people who can benefit from taking a multi. It's more challenging for menstruating women, who have higher iron requirements (18 milligrams/day), than men and postmenopausal women to get enough of the mineral from foods alone. (Consider that three ounces of lean beef – one of the best sources – has roughly three milligrams of iron.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A multivitamin is also recommended for adults over 50 since it provides a well-absorbed form of vitamin B12, which is needed for the normal functioning of the brain and nervous system and for making red blood cells. Up to 30 per cent of older adults do not absorb B12 from foods efficiently and are at risk for a deficiency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to a multi, I recommend taking 1,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D3 during the fall and winter to maintain a sufficient blood vitamin D level. Some people may need a higher daily dose – and year-round – to keep their level up. The safe upper daily limit is 4,000 IU.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How much vitamin D you need varies with skin colour, body weight, age, season, sun exposure in the summer and your blood level (called 25-hydroxyvitamin D). People over 50 become less efficient at making vitamin D when their skin is exposed to sunlight so they may need year-round supplementation. Adequate vitamin D is important for bone health, immunity and may help guard against high blood pressure and colorectal cancer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vitamin C is important, too. The official daily recommended intake is 75 milligrams for women and 90 milligrams for men (smokers need an additional 35 milligrams). However, this is primarily based on the amount needed to avoid deficiency. To prevent chronic disease, research suggests you need 200 to 400 milligrams per day. In addition to eating at least 7 daily servings of fruits and vegetables (combined), consider taking a 200- to 250-milligram vitamin C supplement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I generally advise my clients consume 1,000 milligrams of omega-3 fatty acids – eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) – per day from fish oil for heart and brain health. You'll get this amount by eating 12 ounces of salmon per week. If you don't like fish, add a fish oil or algae-based DHA supplement to your daily routine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Get the rest of your nutrients from whole foods. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and lean protein foods deliver vitamins and minerals along with fibre and thousands of protective plant chemicals. It's a package you can't get in a supplement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As always, speak to your dietitian, doctor or pharmacist about supplementing appropriately.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These events have, famously, been called “a death march with cocktails.” One show after another, with regular stops for drinks offered by the broadcasters. Usually the cocktails start when the sun goes down. But as with so much in the TV racket here, the ambiance varies from the merely strange to the surreal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first presentation on Friday, at 8:45 a.m., was for Cougar Town, the comedy that was on ABC but is now on the TBS cable channel. Flush with the success of shifting a show ABC disliked to a welcoming TBS, the show's creators and cast offered mimosas to the critics at breakfast time. Sparkling wine and grapefruit juice. Trays of mimosas were carried through the hotel ballroom during the press conference. Not many takers, mind you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Onstage, the show's creator, Bill Lawrence, says, “When you have a TV show, the goal is to stay alive.” He suggests we shouldn't be shocked by the mimosas, because there's a lot of drinking on the show. Star Courteney Cox declares, “It feels like a brand-new show that hasn't changed.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non sequiturs and cocktails at 9 a.m. Me, I'm a bit bewildered, especially after a late arrival the night before and five hours sleep. Cougar Town does have a Canadian broadcaster. It's on City TV and returns on Wednesday. But for all the giddiness here, and the cocktails, it's not a show that is generating excitement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banshee (starts Friday, HBO Canada, 11 p.m.) is certainly generating something – puzzlement, excitement and a tincture of controversy. A slightly demented new drama about an ex-con who passes himself off as the new sheriff of a very corrupt small town, it's pulpy, violent and sexy. It's also very dark, if taken literally. The controversy pertains to the gun violence. There is a sense here that a new sensitivity to violence on TV is growing, in the wake of the recent school shootings and in the context of a national debate about guns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greg Yaitanes, the veteran director, who acts as executive producer (along with Alan Ball of True Blood and Six Feet Under) meets a few of us critics to talk up the show and, immediately, addresses the violence issue. He says Banshee has “a more European feel” than most U.S. TV. “It's set in a heightened-reality world, a place where characters behave strangely but the strangeness is integral to the drama.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He acknowledges that there might be a new sensitivity to violence, but points out that his show airs on cable, is unlikely to be seen by children and can't be mistaken for a mainstream drama. He concludes, “in this world of Banshee, violence exists. It would be false to engineer the violence away from its integrity in the drama because of a temporary thing in the [U.S.] culture. We're not a shoot 'em up show. If people want to be sensitive to it, that's their choice.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actor Antony Starr, who plays ex-con Lucas Hood, points out that the show is fiction and can hardly be described as realistic. Sitting for a one-on-one interview, he says, “the key plot point is just implausible. An ex-con becomes sheriff without anybody realizing who he really is. This world is obviously not realistic. There's no way this show can be mistaken for gritty realism. There is sex, there is violence, but it plays out like a graphic novel.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another room – actually a bedroom – Ivana Milicevic, who plays the sheriff's love interest, is also ready to talk. Playful and charming (she starts the interview by posing on the bed, laughing), she says the show is about “heartbreak,” not violence. “My character, Carrie, was in love with this man Lucas when they were both criminals. Now she's married to another man, a great husband, and Lucas turns up again. I think that's heartbreaking.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About the violence, she says, “I'm a girl, and I'd rather watch sex scenes than violence, but I don't have a problem with the violence on Banshee. It's not the real world, is it? And I'm not sure that the problem of violence in society can be put at the feet of the entertainment industry.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe she's right. But it's all very confusing – the vast number of new shows, the violence in them, the frantic selling of them and the cocktails for breakfast. That was just the first morning here, where January is, confusingly, the new September.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirty years ago, Anglo-American politicians set out to make the public sector look like the private sector. They decided to grab hold of the policy-making levers and push public servants to manage operations along the lines of their private-sector counterparts.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's plenty of evidence to suggest politicians have gained the upper hand in shaping policies. Evidence-based policy-making has lost currency, as has the policy advisory role of senior public servants. But there's also plenty of evidence that management reform measures have failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not too much of an exaggeration to write that the policy advisory role of public servants in Anglo-American democracies has been turned on its head. Multiple sources of information and evidence-based policy advice no longer matter as they once did. Today, if policy-making in a post-positivism world is a matter of opinion, where 2 + 2 can equal 5, then <span class="companylink">Google</span> searches, focus groups, public opinion surveys and a well-connected lobbyist can provide any policy answer that politicians wish to hear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public servants of yesteryear would emphasize proper data-gathering procedures and produce analyses with predictive power. Politicians grabbed the policy-making levers and decided to turn bureaucrats into better managers. Public servants were not about to admit that their management skills were lacking, so politicians looked to the private sector for inspiration. As a result, strategic plans were turned into business plans, citizens into customers and cabinet into a powerless board of directors, and attempts were made to tie pay to performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The notion that public administration could be made to look like private-sector management has been ill-conceived, misguided and costly to taxpayers. Management in the private sector has everything to do with the bottom line and market share. Administration in the public sector is a matter of opinion, debate and blame avoidance in a politically charged environment. It doesn't much matter in the private sector if you get it wrong 40 per cent of the time so long as you turn a handsome profit and increase market share. It doesn't much matter in the public sector if you get it right 99 per cent of the time if the 1 per cent you get wrong becomes a heated issue in Question Period and the media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The genius of the private sector is its capacity to generate creative destruction. New sectors and firms attract resources from old ones. New technologies make existing skills and manufacturing processes obsolete. In short, Adam Smith's invisible hand allocates and reallocates resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the public sector, allocating resources remains a political decision. Creative destruction has yet to find a permanent home in government and, until it does, the notion that public-sector administration can be made to look like private-sector management will remain a non-starter. Public servants now produce all manner of reports and navigate various accountability requirements to fabricate a bottom line. The result: Ottawa has an oversupply of officers of Parliament, accountability and oversight processes and performance and evaluation reports. Hundreds of reports are carted every year to Parliament, where they remain unread unless one of them has information to embarrass the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business vocabulary in government has, if nothing more, empowered managers to grow government operations by stealth. The Chrétien-Martin review (1994-98) eliminated 45,000 positions, but by the time Stephen Harper launched his own review in 2011, the government had added more than 70,000 positions. Thousands of new oversight positions have been created in Ottawa to manage accountability processes. Thirty years ago, 70 per cent of federal public servants were located in the regions; today, the number is 57 per cent. Without putting too fine a point on it, public servants in the field deliver public services, while those in Ottawa provide policy advice and manage processes and oversight requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The closest the public sector comes to creative destruction is when the prime minister takes a good whack at bureaucracy. The Mulroney review (1984) and the more substantial Chrétien-Martin (1994-98) and Harper reviews (2011-12) unveiled spending cuts like bolts of lightning. The machinery of government will do as it's told, but it will also batten down the hatches and wait for the storm to pass. When prime ministers take their eyes off the ball, spenders again gain the upper hand. When a department is asked to assume new responsibility, it invariably asks for new resources, unwilling or unable to turn to creative destruction. It explains why the basic problem in government spending is not that it's spending more on new things but that it spends massively on old things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditional public administration values have been tossed out the window, including the commitment to a parsimonious culture. Public servants have lost their way, uncertain how they should assess management performance, how they should generate policy advice, and how they should speak truth to political power and even to their own institution. If anything, recent management reforms in government have made public servants feel worse about their institution than they need to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is that the public service has been knocked off its traditional moorings. Simply saying that government managers should operate like their private-sector counterparts without changing how political and administrative institutions function remains a sure recipe for failure. It entails a steep rise in the overhead cost of government that can't be attributed to programs and services to the public.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WANTED: Hockey goaltender available for term work beginning Boxing Day 2013 and finishing up first week of January, 2014. Location: Malmo, Sweden. Must be Canadian and under 20 at time of employment. Must be willing to withstand unreasonable expectations and crushing pressure. Must be willing to take blame if necessary. Remuneration: none. Cost: potentially devastating.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada, the country that eats its goaltenders alive, has created a situation so untenable it would be laughable if it weren't for the potential for hurt feelings and even derailed careers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You have this on the one hand: a country that prays to an absurd mantra that says “gold or nothing” when, in any other sport but the national one, merely making a podium is usually cause for national cheering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And you have this on the other hand: a “national” game that is today truly “international” – a global sport where any one of six nations in any given year could win the world junior hockey championship, which next year will be held in Sweden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just consider for a moment: Canada won in Ottawa in 2009, the United States won in Saskatoon in 2010, Russia won in Buffalo in 2011, Sweden won in Calgary in 2012 and now the U.S. again in Ufa in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Isn't it about time to put that silly “gold or nothing” talk to pasture?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aim for gold, work hard for gold, but be honoured just to stand on the podium. And if you don't make the podium – as has happened here in Ufa – then get to work getting back up on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you play the “gold or nothing” game, you single out the one player whose singular play or misstep most often decides a championship: the goaltender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The popular saying in hockey is that “we win as a team and we lose as a team,” but that is a bromide easily passed about. More accurately, “we win as a team and when we lose it's usually the goalie who wears it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goaltenders take that position because they like that singular responsibility, but what goaltender in his right mind would accept such responsibility knowing that the chances of being blamed and crushed for a significant loss are unreasonably high in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian head coach Steve Spott said after Canada's loss that there would be questions and that he and the players and Hockey Canada would have to accept this and deal with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the questions raised are obvious and have been known for some time:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian goaltending: Is it true that Canadian goaltending – once the gold standard of hockey – has slipped in recent years? Or is it just that goaltending in other countries has caught up and in some instances surpassed? Should the development of Canadian goaltending be examined? Or is the real problem the ridiculous pressure put on this pivotal position every Boxing Day through the first week of January?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Team makeup: The Americans won with 15 college kids on their roster. Canada used none. The argument is made, year after year, that the major junior kids were superior talent, but that seems at the very least debatable given that so many Canadians are starring at the same colleges these Americans attend. Should Canadian college players be scouted more diligently? Should major junior hockey have a virtual “lock” on roster positions year after year? Perhaps the best teams possible do indeed come completely from junior hockey, but that does not mean the scouting and selection system cannot be re-examined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country's responsibility: Yes, hockey is the national sport. Yes, Canada has done exceptionally well at the world juniors. And yes, Canada will do well again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's just a game. And these are just kids.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donald Fehr's pedigree as a sports labour leader made him the obvious choice to restore order to the <span class="companylink">National Hockey League Players' Association</span>. But it was his status as the ultimate hockey outsider, as well as his tactical knowledge, that determined the course of negotiations on a new collective agreement.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fehr was never going to be “Fehrsie.” He was not bucking for induction into the Hockey Hall of Fame or interested in some future job inside the industry. He was, in other words, immune throughout the negotiating process to the extraneous noise from the so-called insiders and the fifth column among the NHLPA's alumni, the former players who kept telling the current group to take whatever final offer was on the table because, well, they weren't going to do any better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fehr's reputation was more than enough to stand up to a ham-handed attempt by ownership's negotiators to orchestrate a rebellion, based on claims he was withholding information from players – something he did not do during his 23 years atop the Major League Baseball Players Association. Hiring his brother, Steve, as his right-hand man ensured he was getting an unfiltered assessment of each situation while being represented by somebody familiar with his own strategy from their time together with the baseball players' association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while he relied on the executive committee of the NHLPA – as he did in baseball – Fehr also wanted as many players as possible to make personal appearances in the negotiating sessions. He leans philosophically toward a big-tent approach to bargaining. He has the sense that many faces of the game seated across the table pose an issue for ownership, because once the name-calling and finger-pointing are done, the players ultimately sell the game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This confrontation was destined to be a clash of sports cultures. Fehr, a Kansan of distinctly casual bearing, was a protégé of the late Marvin Miller who cut his teeth in nuts-and-bolts battles with baseball ownership before moving on to replace Miller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fehr led the baseball players through a strike that killed the 1994 season, which to outsiders meant he was by nature obstinate and tough and always aiming for the jugular. The bigger truth was his ability to strike deals with baseball ownership at the last moment, and in relatively non-dramatic fashion. That is why those familiar with his tenure as head of the baseball players' union were not surprised that he didn't use the disclaimer of interest weapon as early as he might have, because Fehr has always seen the nut of an agreement peeking through the usual muck and mire of negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fehr is committed to the people who paid his salary – the players – which is why during baseball's steroid crisis, he stood on principles of right to privacy and concerns about the logistics of testing and discipline. Mostly, he marshalled his forces and fought against a salary cap in baseball until the development of a luxury tax and increased revenue made it a moot point for ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet here was Fehr, trying to come to a collective agreement in a sport with a salary cap in place and a commissioner, Gary Bettman, who was operating from the lockout-first playbook written by the New York law firm of <span class="companylink">Proskauer Rose LLP</span> that had been used by the NBA and NFL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hockey has a different culture, and he noted that the players tended to be a less homogeneous group than in baseball – “we have players sitting in the same room whose countries have fought wars with each other's,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were suggestions going into negotiations that Fehr would put the salary cap on the table in negotiations. But he didn't, not even to suggest a reworked, softer cap. Fehr realized two essential principles: that hockey players are like every other group of professional athletes – conservative – and that in a salary-cap league the best a players association can do is limit the ground it loses in each subsequent negotiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What will the future hold for Donald Fehr? Conventional wisdom is he has bigger fish to fry. It has been suggested he might return to the Major League Baseball Players Association, where his successor, Michael Weiner, was treated for a brain tumour in August. But baseball's contract is in place until the end of the 2016 season at least. Fehr is an internationalist and has real ideas about how a true World Cup of hockey could function as a formal partnership between ownership and players. But he is also a pragmatist, and in the end that will determine his future path.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a purely hockey perspective, the most tantalizing story line involving competition on the ice is what will happen next with the <span class="companylink">Vancouver Canucks</span> and goaltender Roberto Luongo.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canucks put Luongo on the trade block following last year's first-round playoff exit to the <span class="companylink">Los Angeles Kings</span>, largely so that Cory Schneider could ascend to the No. 1 job. No deal was done before the NHL ceased operations in mid-September, however, forcing the Canucks to revisit that issue again, now that the lockout is over and training camps will open by the end of the week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The peculiar nature of a shortened 48-to-50 game schedule means the Canucks have two options. They can either keep Luongo for now, thinking that goalies may be particularly susceptible to injuries in a compressed schedule and thus, he would become a valuable insurance policy. Alternatively, they could trade Luongo to the <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span>, a team desperately seeking goaltending help, or the <span class="companylink">Florida Panthers</span>, his former team, which could also use his help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a conference call Sunday, Canucks general manager Mike Gillis wasn't tipping his hand, saying that he wouldn't do anything until the new agreement is approved by the players and ratified by the owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Gillis predicted that there would be “a lot of activity” in the next little while, noting: “There hasn't been any trade discussion while the lockout has been on, so … There are a lot of teams thinking about a lot of things, so we'll see what comes our way.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trade talk, injury updates, player signings and the immediate challenge of repatriating almost 200 players from Europe will keep the 30 hockey-operations departments busy in the next 48 hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The defending Stanley Cup champion Kings had a little bit of bad luck Saturday when they lost their leading scorer last year, Anze Kopitar, to a knee injury in the final game he played for Mora of the Swedish league before the lockout ended. According to Kopitar's agent, Pat Brisson, who spoke to his client on Saturday, Kopitar plans to have a magnetic resonance imaging test Monday, and is expected back in L.A. by Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I say he should be fine, I mean it's nothing major,” Brisson said. “It might be 10 days, it might be 12. It's nothing to panic over. He may have to miss camp, but he's been skating and playing since Sept. 15. And Danny Brière (the <span class="companylink">Philadelphia Flyers</span>' No. 2 centre) got hurt a week ago in Germany, a slight hairline fracture, but he should be okay too.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canucks also have a question with regards to centre Ryan Kesler, who is recovering from off-season shoulder surgery. Gillis said he couldn't accurately predict a return date for Kesler, but that he was “moving in the right direction and everything's positive. We do have extra forwards, so we'll just go through camp and see who's ready to play.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A trio of the <span class="companylink">Edmonton Oilers</span>' top young players – Jordan Eberle, Taylor Hall and rookie Justin Schultz, all of whom had been playing in the minors - was held out of the Oklahoma City Barons lineup Sunday so as not to risk injury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The best thing about not decorating your apartment at all, or hardly bringing enough clothes,” tweeted Hall, “is it's an easy pack job #guyproblems.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of player signings, a handful of key restricted free agents, including the <span class="companylink">Montreal Canadiens</span>' P.K. Subban, the <span class="companylink">Dallas Stars</span>' Jamie Benn and the <span class="companylink">New York Rangers</span>' Michael Del Zotto, were all still seeking new contracts, without which they cannot play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subban's agent, Don Meehan, told The Globe and Mail's Sean Gordon that after he talks to his client Monday, he would try to start negotiations with Canadiens' GM Marc Bergevin by Tuesday or Wednesday, with a view to get a deal done in time for camp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My hope is all of this is going to happen very quickly,” Meehan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some players who were in Europe, including the Canucks' Schneider, had already received their releases from their club teams and were making their way back, but others, such as the <span class="companylink">Pittsburgh Penguins</span>' Evgeni Malkin, waited until the lockout was officially resolved before saying goodbye to their European clubs and scrambling to get back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span>' Milan Michalek was on a bus with his Ceske Budejovice teammates when he learned the news that the lockout ended. He asked the bus to pull over; thanked his teammates for their time together, and had a friend pick him up so that he could get home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Anaheim Ducks</span> forward Bobby Ryan, who played with Kopitar in Mora, tweeted: “That was fast, one minute I'm busing to our next game and the next I'm standing with my bags in hand at a random train station.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Marcus Johansson, the <span class="companylink">Washington Capitals</span>' centre, he was dropped off at a Swedish gas station by his team, BIK Karlskoga, which was traveling to Malmo for a game. Karlskoga assistant coach Tobias Thermell tweeted a picture of Johansson and his kit bags at the gas station, accompanied by the caption: “Now we've let MoJo go.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Members of Canada's world junior team overnighted in London on the way home from Ufa, Russia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It'll be a mad scramble for the 19-year-olds such as Jonathan Huberdeau, the Panthers' prospect, who will land in Montreal Monday, then make his way to Saint John to collect his things before heading to Florida for training camp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brisson, who represents Malkin and <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span> defenceman Sergei Gonchar, has talked to both and says that while they are facing a couple of long travel days, “they're all excited to be coming back and they're all looking forward to start playing again.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, for that matter, are upward of a dozen veterans who weren't signed to contracts in the summer – everyone from Jason Arnott and Mike Knuble to Chris Campoli and Brian Rolston – who will try to land jobs between now and the start of the season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Veteran defenceman Sean O'Donnell is also looking for work after playing last year for the <span class="companylink">Chicago Blackhawks</span>. He has been skating with the <span class="companylink">Tampa Bay Lightning</span> in the hopes that something will come up once the lockout ended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's been good,” O'Donnell said. “It's anywhere between 10 and 15 of us out there. It's not like regular season or practice, but we run some drills and it's pretty high tempo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don't know if there's going to be a team interested or not, but I'd rather try and stay as ready as possible just in case, and if there isn't, then we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On opening night of the lockout-shortened 1994-95 <span class="companylink">NHL</span> season, as the <span class="companylink">New York Rangers</span> raised the banner to celebrate the Stanley Cup they'd won the previous June, Colin Campbell's mind was elsewhere. In the off-season, he'd become the team's new head coach after Mike Keenan left for St. Louis.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Campbell was focused on the future, not the past, specifically, his starting lineup for the opener against the <span class="companylink">Buffalo Sabres</span>. Mark Messier, the driving force behind the championship season, was in a contract dispute, and with moments to go until puck drop, hadn't signed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So it's my first game as the head coach after we'd been waiting so long and I had two lineups ready to go,” Campbell said. “One had Ken Gernander starting at centre, the other Mark Messier. The official scorer was waiting outside our dressing room and I kept asking our PR guy: ‘Is he signed? Is he signed?'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Messier did come to terms just in time and was in the lineup for a 2-1 loss in what Campbell remembered was “a pretty good game for us. But [Sabres goalie Dominik] Hasek stood on his head and we lost 2-1 and then we were behind the eight-ball right away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was hard to catch up that year.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 48 games played in 1994-95 represented a wonderfully chaotic, weirdly unpredictable season, where everything was upside down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But it was also the best hockey I've ever been a part of,” insisted Kelly Hrudey, who played goal for the <span class="companylink">Los Angeles Kings</span> that year and is now an analyst for Hockey Night in Canada. “It was awesome. It was an amazing sprint from start to finish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Training camp was only three or four days long and I remember vividly being really scared during the first practice because as a goalie, I felt way behind everybody else, and knowing there wasn't much time to get ready. We tied the first game 3-3 with the <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span> in L.A. and I let in one, maybe two, ordinary goals. I think it was the next day that [coach] Barry Melrose came and talked to me about it. He said, ‘Unfortunately, in a 48-game schedule, with only intraconference games, we really can't afford that.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was amazing to feel that sort of pressure that quickly in a season. Every game was just so important.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Normally, the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> regular season is long and forgiving, and a team can make up ground if it falls behind early – or can sputter after a fast start. But the 48-game season was, as Hrudey noted, less of a marathon and more of a sprint. Any team quick out of the gate had a chance to make the playoffs, and the team that won the Stanley Cup, the <span class="companylink">New Jersey Devils</span>, was a heavy underdog and started every series on the road. Parity had not become the watchword it is today, but the shrunken schedule kept every team except the sad-sack <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span> (9-34-5) alive until the final week or so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 12-team Western Conference, the gap between the playoff-bound <span class="companylink">Dallas Stars</span> and the last-place <span class="companylink">Anaheim Ducks</span> was five points. Hrudey's Kings needed a tie in their final game against the <span class="companylink">Chicago Blackhawks</span> to qualify, but lost instead and came up one point short.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pacific Division champions that year were the <span class="companylink">Calgary Flames</span>, under third-year coach Dave King. Unlike this year, the 1994-95 lockout didn't begin until the end of training camp, so King had time to get his system in place ahead of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's no question that it helps to be an incumbent coach and have a nucleus of players that have been there and had played for you,” King said. “It doesn't take a lot of time to review, because that's all you're doing in a shortened season – reviewing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“With a first-year coach, you're going to have to build things as the season goes along, recognizing that in a short season, winning early is important.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pat Quinn's <span class="companylink">Vancouver Canucks</span> lost the final the previous year to Keenan's Rangers. In the off-season, Quinn stepped aside in favour of Rick Ley to become the team's full-time general manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quinn recalled the hurry-up nature of 1994-95 as “a difficult time because for a lot of us, it was our first experience with a genuine lockout. We had the players walk away for a short time before [the 10-day strike in 1991-92] so you were just basically winging it. None of us had any real experience at it, so you were just concerned about your players and how they came back in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A lot of teams didn't have their players come in right and for teams who have a bunch of those players, they could get behind really early.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're in danger of injury. All kinds of bad things can happen out of this.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the plus side, motivation wasn't an issue, said King, who said he could remember “so clearly the enthusiasm of the guys, and that made everything kind of work. You knew there would be a few parts of your game that wouldn't be perfect to start with, but their energy was terrific.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“To me, the one position I worried about the most was the goalkeepers. The first one or two games, you're always worried about soft-tissue injuries to your goalkeepers. Your skaters can deal with that a little better, but if a goalie comes in and pops a groin in a short schedule, or strains a hip flexor and he's going to be out a couple of weeks, that's a big difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Not a lot of our goalies are playing in Europe, because Europe doesn't want a lot of our goalies. Plus, if you watch goalies skating informally now, they're not having to work the way they normally would in an <span class="companylink">NHL</span> practice.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conservative government is making education reform the dominant priority in native affairs in 2013, at the expense of reforms to property rights.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But although the confluence of a hunger strike and the aboriginal-rights movement known as Idle No More may have limited the scope of Stephen Harper's native-issues agenda, it will have little impact on his broader national mandate as Prime Minister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The research suggests that Canadians still consider the economy and jobs as a top national issue of concern,” pollster Nik Nanos said Sunday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That focus, and the unfocused nature of Idle No More, will impair the ability of the protests to influence change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Prime Minister meets with native leaders Friday, he is expected to affirm an offer to create a joint government-native working group on how Ottawa is implementing its treaty obligations, according to a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Mr. Harper will also commit to moving forward with a First Nations Education Act that would, on a voluntary basis, consolidate band schools into native-run school boards. The boards would pool resources, teachers and principals, allocate capital spending and develop a native-centric curriculum in accordance with provincial standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Assembly of First Nations</span> has withdrawn its initial support for the act, citing lack of consultation. The government official, while insisting consultation has been continuing, said that Aboriginal and Northern Affairs Minister John Duncan will work with first nations leaders as the bill is drafted in the coming months. The draft legislation will then be shared with first nations communities across the country, before finally being introduced into the House of Commons, possibly in the autumn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conservatives are committed to having the legislation passed by the fall of 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government also indicated last summer that it had plans to introduce legislation making it possible for natives to own their own property on reserves. But given the importance that the government attaches to the education reform bill, and the resistance of the chiefs stoked by Idle No More, property-rights reform has become a reform too far, at least for now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Idle No More is, of course, about far more than preventing future legislation. In the words of its designated spokeswoman, Pam Palmater, the movement seeks to reverse “Harper's assimilatory legislative agenda” and his “destructive environmental agenda,” as she posted on Rabble.ca on Jan. 4.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while Idle No More – first launched late last year by four native women in Saskatchewan and fuelled by social media and the hunger strike of Attawapiskat Chief Theresa Spence – claims no leadership or any other hierarchy, politics lurks in the background, as always.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Palmater, a Mi'kmaq from New Brunswick, is currently Chair in Indigenous Governance at Toronto's Ryerson University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She ran – strongly, if unsuccessfully – against Shawn Atleo for National Chief of the <span class="companylink">Assembly of First Nations</span> last July. In her Jan. 4 post, Ms. Palmater maintained that Mr. Harper decided “to use the <span class="companylink">Assembly of First Nations</span> as his primary vehicle to call all the shots … Harper managed to bully his assimilation plan onto the First Nation agenda with hardly a squeak of opposition at the political level.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are obvious tensions between the Idle No More movement, as represented by Ms. Palmater, and the chiefs of the Assembly, as represented by Mr. Atleo. And although Ms. Spence will be at Friday's meeting, that meeting will be between the Prime Minister and the chiefs, not the activists of Idle No More, which will be staging events across the country that day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the tensions within and between the native leadership and activists, it's easy to understand why the Conservatives have decided to focus on limiting the future agenda to education reform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even at that, many chiefs may be unwilling to co-operate with a government that is now, in the eyes of many natives, simply the enemy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debate over gas development in northeast British Columbia has been building in intensity over the past two years, but it is just starting to heat up.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The release of a new film, Promised Land, starring Matt Damon as a gas-company representative who gets ranchers to sign away leasing rights, will give the issue a high profile this winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And coming soon on the heels of the Hollywood release will be a made-in-B.C. documentary called Fractured Land, which hopes to get everyone talking about the impact of hydraulic fracturing on the environment and on native communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suddenly, fracking, an issue largely obscured by the Enbridge Northern <span class="companylink">Gateway</span> pipeline controversy, is vaulting to the silver screen and into the consciousness of British Columbians. Fracking is a technique that injects a chemical-laced slurry deep underground to fracture rock formations, releasing gas deposits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there was any doubt the public relations battle was building, it was dispelled late last week when the newly founded Shale Resource Centre Canada fired off a long commentary on Promised Land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“With the Canadian debut … shale gas development and hydraulic fracturing could become a hotter topic in the coming months,” states the centre's blog, which uses the film as a talking point to discuss the positive impacts of the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We know it's a Hollywood movie. The industry just wants to get the facts out,” said Karen Carle, a spokeswoman for Shale Resource Centre Canada, a new non-profit founded just last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The centre brushed off Mr. Damon's latest vehicle as “a fictional Hollywood movie and not a documentary on shale gas development.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it might not be so easy to dismiss Fractured Land, which is being made by Canadian filmmakers Fiona Rayher and Damien Gillis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The documentary, which is currently in a crowd-source funding drive, follows Caleb Behn, one of B.C.'s bright, emerging native political leaders, as he explores the complex issues surrounding development in the northeast gas patch. That's where, as the son and grandson of chiefs, he grew up hunting moose, fishing – and watching his community get torn apart by violence, alcohol abuse and poverty.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto's new Chopra Yoga Center – co-founded by Deepak Chopra, the Dr. Oz of alt medicine – sets itself apart in the crowded yogic marketplace with an emphasis on meditation.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With recent studies linking the age-old practice to enhanced creativity, empathy and concentration, and reduced rates of heart disease, stress and loneliness, there's been a resurgence in interest. So it seems entirely fitting that Chopra, who has made himself famous by bringing ancient Indian teachings to the masses, would capitalize on our stressed-out desire to find some peace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, however, I was dubious. After I make my way through the 6,500-square-foot, white-walled and wood-floored space to tonight's 30-minute meditation class, I'm surprised to see the room's sole window offers a view of the gridlocked Gardiner Expressway. Not so Zen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, this quickly becomes irrelevant since our eyes are closed for most of the session. Led by Paul Dermody, a primordial sound meditation teacher (a practice “rooted in the Vedic tradition of India”), we're encouraged to make ourselves comfortable (blankets, handmade cushions and beach lounger-like meditation chairs are on offer). Lit candles (organic and lead-free) are placed throughout the room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After congratulating the class – about 10 men and women, dressed in yoga gear – for making it past the “energy shift” of the new year, Dermody talks briefly about the law of pure potentiality. One of Chopra's seven spiritual laws of success – as per his 1994 bestseller, also available on DVD – it involves practising silence and non-judgment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tonight's mantra: Om bhavam namah (I am absolute existence). This class is clearly more New Agey than I anticipated. (Though perhaps I need to work on my non-judgment.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a short breathing exercise, we recite our mantra. Then it's time for the main event: 15 minutes of silent meditation. While Dermody tells us to “feel our bodies, allow our minds to quiet and calm … and enjoy,” all I feel is mild terror. When was the last time I sat still for five minutes, never mind 15, without a book or my iPhone?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet when he sounds a chime, I can't believe that 15 minutes have passed; I feel clear-headed (and more than a little relieved).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're then asked to imagine a white light radiating through our bodies, gently washing away “the energy that no longer serves us” – my negativity, perhaps? – and instructed to open our eyes “as though we're a newborn child.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The class ends with a chant, sung by Dermody, as well as an encouragement to share a hug with our fellow meditators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Afterward, I ask Dermody what he believes to be the biggest misconception about the practice. He worries that people will find it “a little bit out there.” I can't help but agree. Yet enjoying 15 minutes of silence is such an absolute luxury in my over-scheduled life that I'm more than willing to try again. Our conversation concludes with a hug.</p>

For that reason alone, the announcement of the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s contract settlement early Sunday should mark the end of the Gary Bettman era in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there's a singular failure of his 20-years-plus as commissioner it has been his failure to create a mature relationship with the league's most valuable asset, its players. Instead, he and the hawks in ownership have relied on a sledgehammer approach that finally got them the adversary they deserved: Don Fehr.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disastrous results of that gambit are plain even as negotiators try to get some sleep before revealing the terms of the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One lockout, fans could understand using the lockout mechanism. Twice? Only in dire circumstances. But to lock out players three times, once for an entire season, to win concessions that are being accomplished in Major League Baseball without labour interruption? Inexcusable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were good reasons to alter Bettman's “idiot-proof” collective agreement from 2004-05. His expansion/equity business plan needs a major overhaul. Players had once again outmanoeuvred teams in getting long-term deals. Revenue sharing could be refined. But to shut down the industry, drive the moderate players into Fehr's arms?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All to save a 1990s vision of salary caps, expansion and cowed players. As the song says, there ain't no future in the past. But the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> keeps trying to refine it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fans have rarely mattered in <span class="companylink">NHL</span> headquarters. Their understandable ire won't be the impetus for Bettman's downfall. The league thinks a Hallmark sentiment painted on the ice should placate them. No, it will be the corporate crowd, so cultivated by chief operating officer John Collins, and the broadcasters, the real key to the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s future, who will insist that Gary must go. After all his reversals of field and deceptions the past decade, they regard him as the scorpion in the fable about the scorpion who stings the frog halfway across the river, drowning both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This destructive behaviour is in his corporate DNA. Conciliation is not in his vocabulary. They can't trust him to provide when they launch product. Broadcasters left with months of no programming can't rely on Bettman to keep his business from running into the ditch. League executives empowered to search out business were hung out to dry, begging their clients for patience, always more patience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a deal here for the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> and NHLPA months ago. Moderates in the NHLPA would have bent to compromise if a hand had been extended in partnership. Instead, they received a punch in the nose. There's only one way to start fresh on a decade of healing and growth. That is to give Bettman the gold watch and get into the 21st century.</p>

After all, the sainting of a 17th-century young woman who has been called the Flower of the Algonquins and the Lily of the Mohawks was a recognition by the Roman Catholic Church of the special abiding witness, suffering and dignity of the New World's aboriginal peoples.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the same month, feminist scholars, cloistered nuns, historians and theologians celebrated the extremely rare honour of Doctor of the Church bestowed by fellow German Benedict XVI on the 12th-century Benedictine St. Hildegard of Bingen – cosmologist, mystic, composer, natural scientist, visionary and artist. And this a woman, the official Vatican publication L'Osservatore Romano acknowledged, who “urged the popes to reform, harshly criticizing them and explaining that the Holy Spirit spoke through her, a woman, because the Church, led by men, had betrayed in many ways her nature and her mission.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year marks the 25th anniversary of the publication of John Paul II's apostolic letter Mulieris Dignitatem, a document that boldly proclaimed the institution's boundless thanks “for all the manifestations of the feminine genius which have appeared in the course of history.” Despite the recent spate of feminine canonizations, it's easy to see that many Catholics – of both genders, lay and ordained – might reserve judgment on the efficacy of such a proclamation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think Nuns on the Bus! This quintessentially American phenomenon consisted of a travelling caravan designed to heighten awareness of Catholic social-justice teaching during an election year when familiarity with its contents was at a minimum – even among Catholic candidates. The initiative's primary driver, Sister Simone Campbell, even addressed the Democratic convention. Many U.S. Catholic bishops regretted the notoriety generated by Nuns on the Bus and saw it as a strategic move to sabotage their own efforts to underscore the serious encroachments on religious liberty by the Obama administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this isn't the first instance of an increasingly public conflict between nuns and the episcopacy. Various sister-academicians and spiritual leaders – Elizabeth Johnson of <span class="companylink">Fordham University</span>, Margaret Farley, professor emeritus at Yale, activist Joan Chittister – have been censured, forbidden Catholic honours and platforms, and isolated from their natural faith constituencies. Predictably, interest in their books has soared exponentially.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How to close the gap between the official proclamation of treasuring women in the church and the wide perception that they're undervalued, feared and silenced? Discrepancies abound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More women work in the Vatican than ever (and not in the menial role that was traditional practice for centuries); women are chancellors of dioceses; they hold positions of leadership in pontifical institutions and sit on papal commissions; they're widely consulted, read and admired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what gives?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the remaining years of the current pontificate, the most pressing challenge will be erecting channels of communication and trust between the hierarchy and women, those who are nuns and the vast majority who live their lives outside the cloisters or religious communities. For that to happen, there have to be structures that enable the honest dialogue, the careful listening, and the wise discerning that can only come when censure is lifted, sloganeering abandoned, and polarization muted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why not open the College of Cardinals to women? Include the likes of former Irish president Mary McAleese, Harvard jurist Mary Ann Glendon, Canadian pediatrician and bioethicist Sister Nuala Kenny, philanthropist Kerry Robinson, and feisty art critic Sister Wendy Beckett. They represent a broad spectrum of opinion, possess unimpeachable personal qualities and credentials, and are used to speaking their mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such an innovation is not a departure from doctrine, does not compromise the church's authority, and is not a frivolous concession to faddism. More important, it makes eminent good sense.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians should not feel superior about these troubles; the public finances of this country were comparably hapless in the early 1990s and were repaired. Canada was fortunate in having a form of government in which the executive and legislative branches are not separate but rather intersect.

Social Security, which in the U.S. provides both the equivalents of CPP and of Employment Insurance, is based on an imaginary trust fund, and relies on general federal government revenues. Canadian EI is similarly lacking in specific funding, but that has so far proved manageable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. should move Social Security to a genuine, separate trust fund.

It is not much of an exaggeration to say that most public figures in the United States, on all sides of the debate, praise the report but that hardly any of them actually agree with it. This equal balance of disagreement is, in a way, hopeful. A grand bargain between Democrats and Republicans would have to look very like Simpson-Bowles.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill 115, which imposed a set of collective agreements on school boards and teachers' unions that had not agreed to a new agreement before the end of 2012, will be in effect only until the end of August, 2014 – about a year and a half away. The government, the school boards and the unions should start negotiating soon after the next premier takes office.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It won't surprise you that a recurring theme here at the Critics' Tour is that TV is cool. This is no mere emanation of the egos that control and contribute to the TV racket. It's the general vibe. The Los Angeles Times pronounced recently that TV is the new pop music in terms of defining cool. Just as people once asked each other what bands they admired, in order to get a sense of another person's taste and sensibility, they now ask what TV shows they watch. Everybody agrees this is true.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you adore the IFC show Portlandia (in Canada on SuperChannel), you're one kind of person – a connoisseur of dry irony. If you're a Mad Men fan, you're serious-minded. Game of Thrones fans are definitely cool-nerdy. If you're hot for Hot in Cleveland, you're older and roguish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quite possibly, questions and assertions about TV shows are now being used as pick-up lines in bars all over Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You could say that the channel responsible for the shift in TV's status is HBO. Its long history of excellence inspired every other cable channel to strive for impact with important, excellent television. And if not important, then talked-about. Thing is, HBO has now transcended that old status and it's not only helping define cool, it's making storytelling art at the highest possible level. HBO is no longer niche TV. It has the heft of movie-studio status. It owns what was once the movie world's art-house market. Two examples from HBO's presentations here suffice to explain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the gathered critics sit and look at a stage where David Mamet and Helen Mirren sit. On a giant screen, by satellite from New York, is Al Pacino. There you have, to many minds, America's greatest living playwright, and two actors of enormous accomplishment. And they're talking about a one-off TV show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show is the HBO movie Phil Spector, coming in March. It's about the legendary music producer's trial for murder, the first trial that ended in a hung jury, and his relationship with his lawyer. Of course, this isn't an old-fashioned TV movie-of-the week about some headline-grabbing scandal or tragedy. From what we're shown of the movie, it's about celebrity, media, justice, madness and ego, and it is a corrosive picture of male rage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mirren calls it, “It's a strange amalgamation of imagination and reality.” And as an HBO exec notes, it is about a “mythical” Spector that Mamet crafted, and Pacino plays the character. It's a work of the great playwright's imagination. It's art.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pacino, on the giant screen, looks haggard and keeps kneading his hands, over and over. He can't see us, he can only listen and what he's listening for, it seems, is Mamet's voice. His master's voice. “See, the actor, with Mamet's words, as with Shakespeare's words, it's a gift,” he says eventually, about the script. “And it keeps on giving. That's been my experience with this great writer.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mamet is asked, with great deference, if he might explain his beginnings as a writer. “I grew up as a kid actor in Chicago, and I used to work at Second City in Chicago as a busboy 50 years ago,” he says. “And I would see two or three shows a night at Second City and see these great artists improvising what were seriocomic or tragicomic skits of seven minutes long. And then I started reading Pinter and revue sketches and saw that Pinter was doing the same thing, that he was writing these seriocomic skits that want to make you laugh and cry within seven minutes, which is the length of a scene.” From there, it seems, Mamet's career as a writer took off – American Buffalo, Glengarry Glen Ross, Oleanna and such classic screenplays as The Verdict and The Postman Always Rings Twice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mamet's mythological take on Spector, the reclusive, notoriously difficult music genius, involves seeing him as a caged beast, but more than that, as the Minotaur – the man with the head of a bull who lived in the Cretan Labyrinth, designed by Daedalus and his son Icarus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this comes up – Shakespeare, Pinter, Greek mythology and Mamet's urge to see Spector through the prism of the Minotaur myth. Nobody bats an eyelid. Nobody says, “Are you crazy, don't ya know this is television?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some hours later, on the same stage, sit director Steven Soderbergh and actors Michael Douglas and Matt Damon. They're here to discuss Behind the Candelabra, the HBO movie Soderbergh has directed, about the flamboyant entertainer Liberace and the pianist's relationship with young lover Scott Thorson (played by Damon).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're shown some of it and there are Damon and Douglas, in character, in a bathtub together, kissing and cooing at each other. We see examples of Liberace's extraordinary, camp Las Vegas show and his bizarre TV specials. We see Douglas as Liberace when the relationship ends, denying it ever existed and Douglas looks like he's doing some of his best work as the enraged, deeply conflicted entertainer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soderbergh says he wanted to create a movie about him for more than decade, such was his fascination with Liberace's public fame and personal life. “For years I was thinking about it but couldn't figure out a way in. I didn't want a traditional biopic and I couldn't figure out what the angle was,” he tells us. Then he read Thorson's tell-all book about the relationship, Behind the Candelabra, and Richard LaGravenese (The Fisher King, P.S. I Love You) wrote a script he liked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is some joshing from the critics about the challenges facing Douglas and Damon playing flamboyantly dressed gay men. But it's mild joshing. “We take the relationship seriously,” Soderbergh says. “My feeling based on some of the research we did indicated that it was a real relationship and it was, at that point, the longest relationship Liberace had had. I was very anxious that we not make a caricature of either of the characters or the relationship.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is, then, a serious movie about a gay relationship, one between a famous, powerful man and a younger lover who depends on the older man. And it is a project featuring an Academy Award-winning director, two Oscar-winning actors and an Oscar-nominated writer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's astonishing is what emerges later, when Soderbergh talks further with the critics. He says he took the project to every movie studio in Hollywood and nobody was willing to back it or make it: “They all said it was too gay.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HBO made it. Which isn't just a cool move, or even particularly brave. Just smart. And further underlines why HBO has succeeded in transcending television to become a crucible of the culture, of art.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's one up on most investors, who know neither.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sorry for the blunt talk, but we're at a pivotal moment in investing as we begin 2013. Securities regulators have opened a discussion on the fees investors pay advisers who sell them mutual funds, and this presents a perfect opportunity to raise overall fee awareness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way to do this is to analyze the current extent to which investors understand and engage on the cost of investing. There are two themes at play here, one of them being the way in which the mutual fund industry has infantilized investors by hiding the cost of investing. The other is the willingness of investors to uncritically accept the fund industry's fictional world of zero-cost investing. This is pure laziness and it borders on negligence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mutual fund industry dines off your ignorance. It has created a structure where the fees charged to run mutual funds include a very large chunk that is directed by fund companies to advisers who sell funds and their firms. All fund fees are scooped off the top of fund returns, and the net amount is what appears in fund company literature and on third-party data websites like Globeinvestor.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund industry turned advisers into their sales arm, and rewarded them with a compensation system that kept inattentive investors from ever encountering fees. But advisers sold their souls in this transaction. In allowing people to think there's no cost to advice, they made it possible to also think there's no value to it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advisers who take the long view will agree that, banded together, the Canadian Securities Administrators and provincial securities regulators should end the practice of fund companies paying advisers. These payments, called trailing commissions, are designed to deceive, and not a way for stand-up professionals to be paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What regulators should do is order the replacement of trailing commissions with a fee that is set by the adviser as a percentage of the client's assets, to be withdrawn quarterly from cash holdings in the client's account. The investment industry should introduce the phrase “advice fee” and create standards under which this fee would cover not only investment management, but financial planning. At the end of this path, a decade or two from now, advisers might just be regarded as true professionals like accountants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investing industry is one obstacle to this happening, and not just because the status quo on fees is very lucrative. So much of what the industry does has the effect of intimidating investors to make them compliant: the never-ending stream of jargon, the ubiquitous commentary that investors are doing the wrong thing. Worth noting here is the fact that many of misguided investors have advisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advisers themselves are another obstacle to greater fee transparency, although more and more are moving on their own to professionalize what they do by improving fee disclosure and integrating financial planning into their practices. Laggards should ultimately lose the right to call themselves advisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still another hurdle is you, the investor. You can be half to two-thirds excused for your fee ignorance because of the way you've been manipulated by the investing industry. But let's get real. Do you really imagine that advisers, with all the costs of running a business, can afford to handle your financial affairs for nothing? Have you found any accountants that do your taxes for free, or any lawyers who do the legal work on home sales and purchases at no cost?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expect to pay for good financial advice, whether it's through trailing commissions, through a percentage fee based on your account size or through a flat or hourly fee. The flat or hourly fee model is the ultimate in transparency, but it won't get serious traction in the marketplace until people stop being gobsmacked by the very sensible idea of paying out of pocket for financial advice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investing fees are onion-like in their layering. In a coming column, I'll take my best shot at highlighting them all. For now, accept that you'll pay fees if you have an adviser, and deal with it. Ask your adviser for an itemized list of the fees you're paying and then compare them with the investing services and financial planning you receive. Then, ask to have your short- and long-term investing results compared against an appropriate mix of benchmark stock and bond indexes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in the days of Jean Chrétien's government, I recall talking to a very senior player about the issue of accountability on first nation reserves. The Canadian Alliance was probing the matter, and there were allegations, nothing too specific, about spending abuses. Money disappearing down a black hole, that kind of thing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raising it with the Chrétien official, I recall being surprised when he said there was a basis for many of the allegations. It was a potentially a major scandal, he said. So why, I asked, was no one probing it? Too sensitive, he said. “We'd be accused of racism.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the abject conditions faced by native people, it wasn't an issue the government – or many journalists, for that matter – wished to investigate. It was politically incorrect to go there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now with the revelation – did a member of the Harper circle leak the story? – of no documentation for millions spent at Chief Theresa Spence's Attawapiskat First Nation, the potentially explosive issue is on the table. A broiling controversy on first nations spending, one that could be broadened to include many reserves, would spell disaster. It's the last thing the first nations need at this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a different era. Native people don't have the ear of the government the way they did before. Mr. Chrétien always had a big place in his heart for them. He was the minister of Indian affairs and northern development in Pierre Trudeau's government in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He and his wife, Aline, adopted a native son, Michel, at that time. Michel careened from one crisis to another – with the law, with alcohol, with employment. The Chrétiens saw the sorrows first-hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the landmark 1995 budget that broke the back of the huge federal deficit, Mr. Chrétien and his finance minister, Paul Martin, spared one department from the draconian cuts: Indian affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Martin became prime minister, first nations were one of his priorities. He negotiated the Kelowna Accord, which provided major new investments for education, housing, health services, clean water and more. Although he was criticized by some as just throwing more money at the problem – the standard Liberal methodology, Conservatives charged – it was Mr. Martin's pride and joy. To his dismay, one of the first things Stephen Harper's government did was scrap the accord. But in his post-prime ministerial years, Mr. Martin, who visited the hunger-striking Chief Spence on the weekend, has devoted great amounts of time and energy to aboriginal causes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The approaches of Mr. Chrétien and Mr. Martin are noted because, if leaders with such sympathies couldn't make much progress on aboriginal problems, it gives us an idea how intractable those problems are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harper came out of the Reform movement, which was known to take a less compassionate approach. He has been low profile on native issues, a major exception being his emotional 2008 apology for abuses suffered at residential schools. It was the NDP's Jack Layton who had prodded him on the file, eventually getting his agreement to make the move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the Conservatives, first nations have not been spared budget cuts. They say the cuts have hurt badly. But even if there's more money and it's wisely spent, money isn't the solution to what ails native people. The problems, the controversies – on housing, health care, alcoholism, land claims, resource revenue, resource exploitation – are too many to count.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Idle No More movement and Chief Spence's hunger strike have served the purpose of bringing the issues to the forefront with a Conservative government they claim has been hostile to their interests. It's hoped that a meeting with the Prime Minister on Friday will set a new working agenda for action. If that agenda is compromised or derailed by revelations of a spending scandal on the reserves, another tragic chapter in our aboriginal saga is upon us.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is an error in judgment? Most of us could offer a rough definition if asked. An honest mistake, perhaps. An unintentional slip-up. In a court of law, things are not as simple.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The error-of-judgment defence was at the centre of things when two of Canada's top lawyers traded arguments in Osgoode Hall's ornate Courtroom 3 on Monday. The Municipal Conflict of Interest Act says that a politician caught in a conflict can be excused for it if he or she made a sincere error of judgment. The trial judge in the Ford case, Mr. Justice Charles Hackland, found that Mayor Rob Ford did not qualify for the defence – and the judge expressed himself in pretty strong terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In view of [his] leadership role in ensuring integrity in municipal government, it is difficult to accept an error in judgment defence based essentially on a stubborn sense of entitlement (concerning his football foundation) and a dismissive and confrontational attitude to the Integrity Commissioner and the Code of Conduct. In my opinion, [his] actions were characterized by ignorance of the law and a lack of diligence in securing professional advice, amounting to willful blindness. As such, I find his actions are incompatible with an error in judgment.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naturally, Mr. Ford's lawyer, Alan Lenczner, had a different view. He argued that Mr. Ford is an honest man who made an honest mistake. When the mayor stood to defend himself at a city council meeting over improper fundraising for his football foundation, he simply did not realize he could be running afoul of conflict-of-interest laws. After showing a video of Mr. Ford's speech that day, Mr. Lenczner asked: “Is that the demeanour of someone who is trying to hide something or is it the demeanour of an honest man?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lenczner argued that Mr. Ford had excused himself from council deliberations many times when he thought he had a conflict. On one occasion, he stood aside when council was deliberating about a golf course where his mother was a member. On another, he stood aside when council was discussing city printing operations. His family owns a printing company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, according to Mr. Lenczner's written submission, Mr. Ford “understood that he could not vote where both he, or his family member, and the city had a financial interest in a council agenda item. However, he also reasonably believed that he was permitted to participate when his own conduct … was at issue.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The opposing lawyer, Clayton Ruby, called that all wrong. He argues that ignorance of the law is no excuse – a very old principle of jurisprudence. He says that Mr. Ford showed a “reckless” and “arrogant” attitude throughout. He stiff-armed the Integrity Commissioner again and again when she tried to get him to comply with her rulings on improper fundraising. He did not bother to read the conflict of interest act, did not read a conduct handbook for councillors and did not attend a briefing for councillors. His office had no procedure for identifying conflicts of interest. Those failures, Mr. Ruby says, block Mr. Ford from claiming he made an honest error.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the appeal-court judges, Mr. Justice Edward Then, asked, skeptically, whether Mr. Ford really knew he was offside when he stood in his own defence on that fateful day at council. Mr. Ruby's argument, in essence, is that he damned well should have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his original ruling, Judge Hackland agreed. He said that to get off on error-of-judgment grounds, Mr. Ford would need to have made the error “honestly and in good faith.” In other words, “there must be some diligence on [his] part; that is, some effort to understand and appreciate his obligations. Outright ignorance of the law will not suffice, nor will willful blindness as to one's obligations.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three appeal-court judges may take a different view, of course, when they render judgment. But to overturn Mr. Justice Hackland's ruling, they must not simply disagree with it; they must find, as Mr. Ruby puts it, “a palpable and overriding error.” That is a high hurdle indeed. If they can't clear it, Mr. Ford is out of a job.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environmental journalist Mark Lynas used to think that genetically modified crops were evil. He was a leader in the anti-GM movement, and spent years helping to rip out GM crops. The crusade against GM foods was one of the most successful environmental campaigns of all time. Today, GM technology is feared and reviled by celebrity chefs, foodies and peasant farmers around the world. GM crops are banned in much of Africa and India, and all but banned in Europe.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, Mr. Lynas has recanted. He admits he was unequivocally, disastrously wrong about GM foods, and he's offering his apology. “I could not have chosen a more counterproductive path,” he told a British farming conference last Thursday. “I now regret it completely.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What led to his change of heart? He started studying the science. He discovered there was no scientific evidence for the alleged dangers of GM technology, and overwhelming evidence for its value in increasing crop yields and producing more and better food to feed the hungry of the world. “The real Frankenstein's monster was not GM technology, but our reaction against it,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within hours, Mr. Lynas's speech was tweeted around the world. Not everyone applauded. India's Vandana Shiva, a leading anti-GM activist, said allowing farmers to use GMOs is like saying rapists should have freedom to rape. But most of the reaction has been positive. “Something has moved in the terms of this debate,” Mr. Lynas told me. “It's like the cresting of a wave. It's as if everyone has simultanously realized that the anti-GM movement doesn't actually have anything backing it up.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Something else is changing, too. People are hungry to hear from a new generation of environmental moderates who value science and pragmatism over ideology and absolutes. They want to hear from those like Mr. Lynas, who think technology can be a force for good, and want to find practical approaches to environmental problems. They want to hear that environmental responsibility isn't always incompatible with human betterment and economic progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such voices are all too rare. But without them, the environmental movement is doomed to terminal irrelevance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there ever was a moral issue, it's GM technology, which has been stalled and blocked in the very parts of the world that need it most. By 2050, as Mr. Lynas points out, the world will have to feed nearly 10 billion people on roughly the same land area we use today, using limited fertilizer, water and pesticides in the context of a changing climate. If standards of living continue to rise in developing countries – and we should all hope they do – that's a doubling of global demand. The only way to get there from here is with technological innovation that proceeds much more rapidly than we're allowing it to now. The alternative is a lot more hunger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the teeth of all the evidence, there's simply no argument – moral, economic, scientific, political or any other kind – for opposing agricultural biotechnology (which, as Mr. Lynas notes, has become dominated by big multinationals because green opposition has made it so expensive to develop). The fight against biotech is, at root, a contest between the aesthetic preferences of the developed world's urban elites and people in India and Africa who don't have enough to eat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why Mr. Lynas went public, as loudly and eloquently as he could. “I've felt a strong burden of moral responsibility for having effectively told an enormous lie for many years,” he told me. “I was pushed by my own conscience.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why should Canada help Mali?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because our African friends so desperately need our assistance in stopping the threat of a jihadist takeover of northern Africa. And that threat is very real: Al-Qaeda and its allies are preparing to turn an 8,000-kilometre strip stretching across the widest part of Africa into a chaotic and ungovernable zone in which their jihad would flourish. They told me repeatedly, during my 130 days as their captive, that such was their aim: to extend the turmoil of Somalia from Mogadishu on the Indian Ocean to Nouakchott on the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb even partly succeed – in concert with their murderous jihadi brothers in Boko Haram and al Shabaab – it would create an economic and humanitarian disaster of barely imaginable dimensions. And we also know that, given such an eventuality, we would then be required by popular insistence (the suffering of Darfur would pale in comparison) to intervene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surely it makes sense, then, to prevent all that from happening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We know full well that neither a somewhat better-trained Malian army nor a voluntarily funded light brigade drawn from a dozen African nations stands any hope of eradicating the jihadi threat on their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past half-century, Canada and other developed countries have invested more than $60-billion in assistance to the countries of the Sahel. Does it not make sense to protect such a huge investment in the lives and welfare of something like half a billion Africans?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We also need to accept that, in some part, we bear responsibility for Mali's plight and for the enhanced Islamist threat to the entire sub-Saharan region. However inadvertently, by making possible the wholesale looting of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi's arsenals, we have caused havoc to spread across what is arguably the most unstable region of the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a captive of AQIM, I learned of its implacable hatred of all things Western, of the extent to which it despised the ideals we hold most dear: freedom, liberty, democracy, equality, human rights – all things it fervently believed were the exclusive province of God, not of men. It's essential we be clear about the fact that there's absolutely nothing to negotiate with these guys. There's nothing we have to offer that would cause them to veer from their path – beyond, of course, our total submission to their extreme seventh-century Islamic perspective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, I despair when I hear <span class="companylink">United Nations</span> bureaucrats, diplomats and politicians proposing that we delay military operations while we open some sort of negotiation with “the rebels in the north.” Al-Qaeda will use such naive efforts as a way to buy time to improve its defensive positions, increase its strength through recruitment and importing additional fighters, and further terrorize the hapless Malians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, as AQIM spokesmen make clear, we, too, are squarely within their jihadi sights. They won't be talked out of their jihad. They won't compromise. They can only be defeated now, or later at a much greater cost in blood and treasure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What could Canada do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most immediately, we could acknowledge the plight of our African friends and let them know we're committed to helping them find a solution to the Islamist menace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Politicians of late have been running for cover, claiming that “nobody has asked us for anything.” What, I wonder, do they think operative paragraph 14 of Security Council Resolution 2085, of Dec. 20, means when it calls on UN member states and international organizations to provide “equipment, intelligence, logistical support and any necessary assistance in efforts to reduce the threat posed by terrorist organizations”?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More substantively, we could immediately join the Europeans and Americans in offering to resume our military training programs. Sure, we have to pay politically correct obeisance to the “African-led” bit, but everyone knows the Africans can't do what needs to be done on their own. Canada, in company with like-minded friends, clearly has military skills that would be of significant use to get this job done, and done right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then, some ask, wouldn't the invasion of yet another “Muslim land” meet the same ignominious fate as the other forays?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the most important military adage I learned as deputy defence minister is “maintain the aim.” But we didn't in Afghanistan. If the international attempt to free Mali and the wider Sahel region from the jihadist scourge is to be successful, we will have to remember this hard-learned lesson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This must be about damaging and degrading the capabilities and numbers of al-Qaeda in northern Mali that it won't soon threaten the peace and stability of our friends across this vulnerable region. And it must also be about helping Mali's armed forces to reoccupy and then defend their country once the jihadis have been diminished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It won't be about turning Mali into Saskatchewan or Nebraska. And it won't be about exporting our social safety net or funding a government or anything else that isn't directly related to damaging al-Qaeda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This crisis isn't about development. People don't join al-Qaeda because they can't find good jobs, or because their families are starving. I fervently hope that Canada, along with other donors, would resume our generous development programs once the al-Qaeda menace has been reduced to locally manageable proportions, but these two objectives must be kept carefully separated lest we recreate the Afghan quagmire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Fowler, a personal representative for Africa for prime ministers Jean Chrétien, Paul Martin and Stephen Harper, was seized in December of 2008 by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb while serving as <span class="companylink">the UN</span> Secretary-General's special envoy to Niger and held captive in the Sahara until his release in April of 2009.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guns pose an extraordinary danger, to the households of their owners and to the communities in which they proliferate. So a suburban New York daily, The Journal News, was acting in the public interest when it published a list of names and addresses of 33,000 handgun permit-holders in two counties, freely available from public sources. Even so, we feel uncomfortable with the invasion of privacy and potential for harm, and wonder whether the newspaper might have achieved most of its public-interest goals without outing individual permit-holders.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some media critics, such as Al Tompkins of the Poynter Institute in Florida, say the newspaper would have served its readers better by offering more context, such as whether people with criminal records had obtained permits. But people are being killed or injured at an extraordinary rate because of guns, many of them obtained legally. The killing of 20 children and six adults at an elementary school in Connecticut last month is just one example. Twelve thousand homicides, 18,000 suicides, 600 killed and 14,000 wounded in accidents each year – how much more context is necessary?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Journal sought to tell readers who has guns so they can know, for instance, whether it is safe to send their children to play at someone else's home. Yet not all permit-holders have guns at home; and owners of long guns do not need a permit. So people still do not know for sure who has a gun at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is probably awkward to ask a neighbour or parent of your child's school chum about guns at home, but if you feel poor storage of guns is a danger, you probably shouldn't be satisfied with the information on the list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a sense of a civilizational clash over guns building in the U.S. Those who abhor guns are fighting back. But there are potential dangers. Thieves could use the list to determine what homes can be robbed of guns, or what homes can be robbed without having to shoot a gun owner. A map without addresses and names probably would have made the point about the mad and threateningly close proliferation of weapons.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a decade without putting out a note of new material, Bowie reappeared in a new music video on Tuesday, as a face projected onto a stuffed Siamese-twin puppet. As usual, he forced us to reorient ourselves and take nothing about him for granted. Where Are We Now?, the title of the song, might equally apply to the audience watching Tony Oursler's unexpected video: Where are we now with David Bowie?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has always been keen to put us in a place not experienced before, somewhere fantastical yet urgently present. His first hit, Space Oddity, was about a disaffected astronaut floating in the metaphor of outer space. Real stardom found Bowie disguised as Ziggy Stardust, a space-age rock-star caricature whose shadow haunted the singer even after Ziggy's hasty burial in 1974. At times, David Bowie has seemed almost less real than his personae, from the Thin White Duke to the doubting, apocalyptic dreamer of 2002's Heathen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bowie grew up in a suburb of London, and his drive toward the centre of the pop world has always involved pulling in things that were out on the margins. In many ways, he has succeeded in music by cultivating a theatre sensibility, just as Peter Greenaway became a distinctive filmmaker by looking through the lens like a painter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The godfather of Ziggy Stardust may have been the English actor and mime Lindsay Kemp, who Bowie studied with, and whose extravagant self-presentation gave his young student permission to invent glam rock. I've seen several Kemp shows, and like Bowie, he makes you feel things by pushing past limits – of gender, taste, even gravity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another big figure for Bowie was Anthony Newley, a musical-theatre performer of tremendous verve and old-fashioned craft. You can hear the mature Newley's vocal style in much of Bowie's singing, but he also absorbed from Newley the knack of becoming the character who could be expressed in the song.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cliché about actors is that they need to be a character, to fill a void inside. “Offstage, I'm a robot,” Bowie told Newsweek in 1973. “Onstage, I achieve emotion. It's probably why I prefer dressing up as Ziggy to being David.” He said later that Ziggy's rampant success threatened his own sense of self. His move to Berlin in 1976 was partly an escape, as were the relatively experimental recordings (including Low) he made there with Brian Eno.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it happens, that's the period and place Bowie wants us to think about in Where Are We Now? In the video, a screen behind the singer's projected face shows black-and-white footage of Berlin from the seventies, with shots of the Wall and street scenes. The lyrics are full of allusions to Berlin avenues, but you can tell he's singing about the vanished locations of the mind, where actual people once were, but are no longer. He's “a man lost in time… just walking the dead.” For the first time, perhaps, we're seeing a Bowie with no disguise at all. He's very much a 66-year-old man, looking rather sadly into a past that's much longer than his future, lips barely moving over the remembered names.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's safe to assume the conceit of putting Bowie's face on a cloth bag-head is all Oursler's – he has been projecting faces on distorting surfaces for years. But this is the first time his gallery of face oddities has included a rock star. The two-headed puppet's other face is that of a young woman, who doesn't sing and hasn't been identified. My guess is that whoever she is, she's at least partly a symbol, for Bowie's somewhat opportunistic gender blurring, and for the promise of renewal. “As long as there's sun, as long as there's rain,” he sings – as long as there's life, in short, new music and art are possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not clear whether Bowie was actually in Oursler's New York studio when the video was shot. His part could have been filmed anywhere, then projected into a space full of intriguing objects but devoid of visible people. That's one of the little jokes of this sombre video: While musing about where he may be now, Bowie isn't even on the scene. He's always like that – somewhere else, even when we're looking right at him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Bowie's album The Next Day will be released on March 11. The <span class="companylink">Victoria and Albert Museum</span>'s David Bowie retrospective exhibition opens on March 23.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A GENTLE COMEBACK</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Known for his fierce fashion and bold conceptions, David Bowie has returned from exile in gentle, existential form. With no warning, the inimitable English rock star celebrated his 66th birthday on Tuesday with the release of Where Are We Now, a new song from his first album in a decade. The 14-track The Next Day is due out in Canada on March 11. On Bowie's newly relaunched website, the track elegantly flows to a lyric video that looks back upon the singer's days in Berlin. Words are sung soft and high as the luxurious, less than Bowie-like ballad rises to a moving, questioning chorus. The song is wistful, hopeful – “as long as there's sun, as long as there's sun/ as long as there's rain, as long as there's rain.” Bowie, who once famously sang that he could not trace time, has done just that, sublimely.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when the decisions are easy, the annual election of players to baseball's Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., is the most overanalyzed and overwrought vote in sports. Wednesday's announcement of the class of 2013 will be triple that, and then some.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To hear people speak, this year's ballot is toxic because it contains two names from baseball's steroid era, Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens, as well as Mike Piazza and Jeff Bagwell, two significant offensive players who have been unfairly tainted by amateur physiologists who believe body size and type alone are evidence of steroid use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a fear of wrestling with the issue, with critics of the process suggesting that the Hall of Fame needs to give voters more guidance about the place of character beyond the soft-sounding charge that voters should base their decisions on the player's record, playing ability, “integrity, sportsmanship, character” and contributions to the clubs on which he played.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good luck with that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good luck defining “character” and “integrity” in a game that has historically celebrated bending or breaking the rules, popping pills to play “through the pain” and be a “gamer,” and kept out players due to their skin colour. No-hitters have been pitched and World Series won without black players being allowed on the field.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in the free-spirited days of the 1960s and 1970s and the cocaine-fuelled 1980s, you had best believe not everybody played every inning clear-eyed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best thing about the Hall of Fame is that it will survive the prejudices and predispositions of the people who watch, run, play, report on baseball and select its inductees. It will survive the combination of statistical, anecdotal and first-hand reflection that led some of us to vote for Bonds, Clemens, Piazza, Mark McGwire, Larry Walker and Tim Raines on our ballot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hall will survive the obstinate nature of those of us who think using all 10 allotted places on the ballot cheapens what should be an exclusive club; who grudgingly give up our vote with favouritism for players we have actually seen; who are not above voting for, say, McGwire as an act of defiance in the face of zealous interpretations of when exactly the playing field stopped being level. That “small-tent” approach – which isn't meant to sound as obnoxious as it seems – makes it difficult for those voters who don't like jockeying names on and off each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You will hear fretting about the chance that no one player gets the required 75 per cent of votes to gain admission this time around, and that might happen. No one, not even those of us who didn't vote for him, would begrudge Jack Morris getting in, but he has some statistical lifting to do. You'd like to think a player of Raines's pedigree would get enough support and maybe even gain traction from steroid withholders looking to put their votes elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cooperstown will survive and indeed grow and get better because the Hall usually gets it right. Can the process be changed? Tough question. How do you tidy up a democracy? One suggestion: forget trying to define the undefinable, but cut down the number of players allowed per ballot to, say, five.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So fear not the release of Wednesday's vote by members of the <span class="companylink">Baseball Writers' Association of America</span> at 2 p.m. (Eastern). Fear not for the legacy of Bonds and Clemens and the really aggrieved party here, Piazza, who was the most dominant offensive catcher since Johnny Bench, guilty apparently of having too much acne on his back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't fear for the message that would be sent by a Hall of Fame shutout. Celebrate, instead, the induction of the late Tom Cheek, the long-time voice of the <span class="companylink">Toronto Blue Jays</span> who was selected as this year's winner of the Ford C. Frick Award for broadcast excellence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the most part, Cooperstown takes care of all in its own way, if not always in a linear fashion and at a speed that is to everybody's satisfaction (for example, the egregious blackballing of the late Marvin Miller, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association from 1966 to 1982).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not perfect, which makes it perfect for the sport it celebrates.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the candidates for the Ontario Liberal leadership is proposing a new system for setting provincial electoral boundaries that would give much more power to the Greater Toronto Area, at the expense of under-populated rural ridings.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to his campaign officials, former government services minister Harinder Takhar is calling for the province to stop mirroring federal districts, as it has since the 1990s. He would give an independent “Ontario boundary commission” the task of drawing a new map that would provide something closer to “true representation by population.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it were to gain steam, the proposal could play to both the Liberals' strengths and weaknesses. It would increase the number of seats in the fast-growing “905 belt,” which the governing party nearly swept last election. But it would also further alienate rural and small-town regions, making it harder for them to rebuild in areas where they were virtually wiped out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Mr. Takhar is seen to have little chance of winning Premier Dalton McGuinty's job at the Liberals' convention later this month, his policy proposals are drawing attention from other candidates who will be looking for second-choice support from his delegates. And reactions from the two perceived leadership front-runners were indicative of significantly different perspectives on the urban-rural balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sandra Pupatello, a former Windsor MPP who has made much of being the only candidate from outside the GTA, was lukewarm at best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is essential that we acknowledge the growth of our population in urban and suburban areas, but not at the expense of the democratic rights of our rural and northern regions,” she said through a spokesperson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Kathleen Wynne – who appears to have considerable provincewide support, but is strongest in her hometown of Toronto – was more open to what she called “an interesting idea.” While acknowledging that both rural sensitivities and the cost of adding new constituencies would have to be taken into account, Ms. Wynne said it “makes a lot of sense” to strive for more equal representation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if it continues to take its lead from Ottawa, the province will likely come closer to that equality in the years ahead. The federal map is in the midst of being redrawn, with Ontario standing to gain 15 new ridings to reflect population movement. A vote could be held in the legislature to adopt the same boundaries, while preserving the one notable difference on Ontario's map – an extra riding in the province's sparsely populated but geographically enormous north.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That in itself might be controversial, given the optics of adding more politicians as the government otherwise tightens its belt. But Mr. Takhar contends that it wouldn't be adequate, because it would allow for up to 25-per-cent population variation between urban and rural ridings – still leaving individuals in places such as Mississauga, which he represents, with less voice than those elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His proposal would itself add no more than 15 new seats, and would preserve the existing northern boundaries. So it would likely require the new commission to actively shrink the number of seats in eastern and Southwestern Ontario, to help bring their numbers in line with the GTA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Takhar has put forward enough other policy proposals – including faster elimination of the provincial deficit, using savings bonds to fund new infrastructure, and increasing protections for temporary workers – that redistribution may not be pivotal to winning his support on the convention floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But improbable though it may be, there are some Liberals with a faint hope of adopting new boundaries before Ontario next goes to the polls. They will no doubt appreciate Mr. Takhar at least getting the discussion going, even as Liberals hoping to rebuild rural support will hope it quickly dies down again.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some of the poorest countries of Latin America, one can find a refreshing (and radical) departure from the conventional economic thinking entrenched in Canada and around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not often that people look to countries such as Ecuador or Bolivia as examples that might have something to teach Canada. And yet, when it comes to finding new forms of economic development that pay serious attention to the environment, this is exactly the case. And at a time when Canada's oil sands production continues to grow despite climate science predicting even more alarming consequences, it's high time we had a look at what's going on in the Andes. As part of a documentary production for The Nature of Things, that's exactly what I did.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I was amazed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Ecuador and Bolivia are embarking on new paths of social and economic development toward what they call “sumak kawsay,” or “living well.” This indigenous concept stands in contrast to the neo-liberal model of development that's always about growth. The mantra is more productivity, more growth, more consumption of resources, ad infinitum. Ad nauseam!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, “living well” is about developing in harmony with nature, meeting human rights and satisfying basic needs for all, and living in balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, it sounds nice on paper, but what does it mean in practice?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa told me that one example of this new vision of development is the fact that his country's constitution is the first in the world to give rights to nature. In other words, trees, animals, rivers – entire ecosystems – have the constitutional right to exist and flourish. It's a far cry from Canada's “Ministry of the Environment,” which is more about managing human use of the environment than about Mother Nature herself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, two American residents of Ecuador were the first to go to court on behalf of nature, over damage to a river caused by a provincial government road construction crew. The case was a first for Ecuador and the world, establishing a legal precedent we can only hope spreads around the globe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Correa also told me that Ecuador's attempt to marry ecology and economy has lead to a radical proposal to not exploit 20 per cent of the country's untapped oil reserves. Those reserves happen to lie under Yasuní National Park – a jewel of the Amazon rain forest thought to harbour the highest level of biodiversity on Earth. Scientists have found more species of trees in one hectare of this forest than there are in all of North America from Alaska to Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ecuador's Yasuní-ITT initiative promises to leave that oil in the ground, to help combat climate change, but asks the global community to be “co-responsible” and contribute half of the profits the country would be giving up: $3.6-billion. So far, they've raised $300-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a country whose economy depends on oil to propose such an initiative is remarkable. Nearly 30 per cent of Ecuadoreans live below the poverty line, yet the country is wildly supportive of the initiative. What's Canada's excuse? Surely we could afford to do something similar with the oil sands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another lesson Canada could learn takes place high in the Andes mountains, in Bolivia's Uyuni salt flats. The flats are the fossil remnant of an ancient seabed containing more than half of the world's lithium deposits. (Lithium is much in demand, and electric cars using lithium batteries are expected to play an increasing role in reducing our carbon footprint.) Heavy hitters such as China, Japan and the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> are seeking new sources of lithium. But instead of exporting raw lithium to these industrialized nations for them to make the batteries, Bolivia plans to make the batteries itself and thus realize the real economic benefits of value-added products. There's no doubt this is an ambitious gamble that could fail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, in Canada, we continue being “hewers of wood and drawers of water,” as we ship raw logs and raw bitumen elsewhere. At least in this respect, Canada could learn from Bolivia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, we're not saying that Bolivia and Ecuador have all the answers, or that they don't have environmental and economic contradictions to sort out. But they're grappling with these issues and forging new paths toward a different kind of growth that's attuned with nature – and that's what makes them such exciting models. Which is more than anyone can say for Canada these days.</p>

We're talking jug-quality wine typically made with 70-per-cent imported bulk juice blended with 30-per-cent Ontario content. Not my thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before I get to the outdated rationale behind the absurd ban and the reasons it should be lifted without delay, let me elaborate on boxed-wine's virtues. The cardboard is merely a protective shell. Inside is a plastic sack outfitted with a spout that protrudes from the side. Squeeze the spout and the bag shrinks. Air, wine's great spoiler, can't get in, so the wine stays fresh for four to six weeks, versus a few days in a half-empty bottle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not a perfect seal. Some air creeps in even before you first tug on the tap, which is why many producers stamp an expiration date on the exterior. Gail Becke, advanced-film development manager for <span class="companylink">Scholle Packaging</span> of California, the largest manufacturer of bag-in-box containers, which invented the format in the 1950s as a disposable container for battery acid, says that a sealed three-litre box should remain intact for nine months. And, no, she adds, none of Scholle's bags contains bisphenol A, the toxic substance banned for use in baby bottles in Canada after it was linked to higher risk of breast cancer and heart disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boxed wines are ideal for outdoor use, especially picnics and camping (where alcohol consumption is legal, of course). At home, you need not worry about wasting a full bottle to have a glass or two or when you want to use a splash in cooking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides convenience, there's a green dividend. Cardboard and plastic weigh much less than glass, and the boxes can be stacked densely, so there's a more benign carbon footprint associated with shipping boxed wine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paradoxically, environmental concerns were the reason Ontario shut out most players from the marketplace two decades ago – in the early 1990s, recycling facilities couldn't handle the plastic bladders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province, in conjunction with the LCBO, ordered a moratorium on new entrants. That left just the existing producers, which had been offering nothing but cellared-in-Canada plonk at the time, with a grandfathered monopoly on boxes (one-litre Tetra Paks were exempted).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's been a sea change in recycling capabilities,” says Ian Campbell, executive director of Drinks Ontario, the trade group representing more than 100 Ontario importers. Many blue-box programs now accept bag-in-box containers, and the market for recycled glass is less robust than it used to be. “The rationale [against boxed wine] was for environmental reasons,” Campbell adds, “and it's for exactly that reason that the moratorium should be rescinded.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, bargain hunters across Canada and around the world have been treated to a growing selection of higher-quality boxed wines. In Australia, the “cask wine” segment (another name for bag-in-box) represented 38.7-per-cent of total wine volume in the 12 months ending last May, according to Aztec, a market-research firm. Scandinavia is another hotbed. So is Manitoba, where one can find 114 boxed products at Manitoba Liquor Marts, including 45 imports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For consumers, there's another serious advantage. The savings can be substantial. In Manitoba, Banrock Station Shiraz from Australia costs $35.49 for a three-litre box. That's equivalent to four 750-millilitre bottles. The same volume in glass costs $53.96, a difference of $18.47.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A highlight of my cross-country tasting is the crisp, citrusy Concha y Toro Frontera Sauvignon Blanc 2012 from Chile, priced at $33.79 in New Brunswick for three litres, a $6.17 savings compared with four bottles. I also liked the round, pear-like Bota Box Pinot Grigio from California ($39.99 for three litres in Saskatchewan), juicy De Bortoli Premium Reserve Merlot from Australia ($24.99 for two litres in Manitoba) and silky-spicy Vernissage Syrah Cabernet Sauvignon ($49.75 for three litres in Quebec).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latter is a French red sourced by a Swedish company, its box designed to resemble a woman's purse. It's part of a growing trend toward alternative box formats. Some now come in tall tubes, which, depending on your aesthetic tastes, can seem a little less lowbrow than a plain carton. I also especially like the flavour as well as the look of jammy-earthy Mauro Zinfandel from Italy in a tall, curvy box, but it's not yet available in Canada. Banrock Station Shiraz from Australia (another wine widely available in bottle) wasn't bad and comes in a square box in environmentally friendly brown craft paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I didn't like everything I sampled, to be sure. While Bota Box's pinot grigio excelled, the cabernet sauvignon was too sweet for my palate, a red seemingly geared to newbie wine drinkers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imports are not the only boxed products shut out of Ontario, sadly. Until last year, the Vintners Quality Alliance, which oversees most higher-end domestic products made with all-Canadian juice, prohibited producers from using the VQA designation on anything but bottles. That exclusion, though lifted in July, sealed the fate of would-be VQA entrants. They're simply not allowed on LCBO shelves because they're not covered by the grandfathered Canadian exemptions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have no plans to change the existing bag-in-box category,” says LCBO spokeswoman Heather MacGregor. “If we were to consider changes, we would consult with and seek the support of government, Ontario industry trade groups as well as the wineries currently selling the products.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, an environmentally friendly, cost-effective package designed to promote moderate consumption (or at least discourage wine waste) is not a priority for Canada's most populous province. For shame.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We take you now to that faraway <span class="companylink">NHL</span> outpost in Dallas, where the Stars could be viewed as the poster children for why the lockout was fought in the first place.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a time when Dallas mattered in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s big picture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stars were a U.S. Sunbelt success story, winners of the 1999 Stanley Cup, and runners-up in 2000. They were owned by Tom Hicks, who had deep pockets at one stage, and thus became a major player in <span class="companylink">NHL</span> free agency when spending restrictions were a figment of commissioner Gary Bettman's active imagination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then came Hicks's celebrated financial troubles, which forced him to put a for-sale sign on the franchise and ushered in a more frugal era where all of general manager Joe Nieuwendyk's spending decisions had to be cleared through a series of lenders that effectively controlled the team's financial operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only after Tom Gaglardi, the Vancouver-based hospitality industry scion, bought the team did the financial picture change for the better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stars chased the <span class="companylink">Los Angeles Kings</span> down to the wire last season, but missed out on a playoff spot and finished 10th.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The byproduct of all that ownership angst was four consecutive years out of the playoffs, plus a dramatic shift in where the Stars fit in on the local sports pecking order. During the transition from Hicks's ownership to Gaglardi's, empty seats became the norm at the Stars' once sold-out building. Accordingly, for Dallas, getting a new labour agreement in place, and getting to play some hockey in 2012-13, was critical from an operations standpoint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dallas has been successful at the box office when it has had success on the ice, but fell into the Land of Who Cares when it fell on harder times. It is why, last summer, the Stars signed a couple of short-term 40-somethings – Jaromir Jagr and Ray Whitney – they hope can be difference makers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jagr in particular is there, partly because he contributed a wholly respectable 54 points to the <span class="companylink">Philadelphia Flyers</span> last year, and partly because he is a legendary figure in the game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Whether they know what Jagr's history is or not, they view him as some sort of rock star that plays hockey,” Nieuwendyk said. “So down here in Texas, they're pretty excited by that and the other changes we made this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Couple that with the fact that the Cowboys didn't make the [NFL] playoffs and the [NBA's] Mavericks are having an off year, hopefully we can steal a little thunder here.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond a winning team, a rock star is what the Stars desperately need right now. They had that in the past – Brett Hull, Mike Modano and Ed Belfour were all marquee attractions during the championship days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new-look Stars were different. That their two best forwards, Jamie Benn and Loui Eriksson, were selected to the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s all-underrated team last year in a Sports Illustrated poll is both a good and a bad thing. Underrated players are generally a prized commodity, except when it comes to marketing, where a little flash and dash never hurt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Benn is unsigned and, with apologies to <span class="companylink">Montreal Canadiens</span> blueliner P.K. Subban and <span class="companylink">New York Rangers</span> defenceman Michael Del Zotto, is probably the most important restricted free agent who needs to come to contract terms before the puck is dropped on the new season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Nieuwendyk, once the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s new labour pact is ratified by owners and players, getting Benn's name on a contract will be a priority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stars didn't get their conference realignment wish, so they will have one of the most challenging travel schedules in 2012-13, playing all their away games two time zones over, same as usual. Plus, there's the travel to Western Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Those teams in the Eastern Conference, they don't have to leave their time zones the entire year,” Nieuwendyk said. “Isn't that something?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, it is. And here's something else: Nieuwendyk was with the <span class="companylink">Calgary Flames</span> in 1994-95, the last time the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> played a 48-game season, and finished 15th in the overall scoring race that year, with 50 points in 46 games. The leader was Jagr, with 70 points in 48 games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Your memory about that year is better than mine,” Nieuwendyk said with a laugh, “but maybe that explains why he asked for a $50,000 bonus this summer, in case he led the league in scoring.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Hockey League</span> is faced with the same conundrum as ever – the markets that haven't taken to hockey won't be rescued by the new collective agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a Canadian perspective, it's annoying to observe the endless financial agonies of the Phoenix franchise, even as hockey-lovers in Quebec City await another chance at a team. (And Seattle is viewed as next in line, if a struggling franchise is to be moved.) And it's doubly annoying to think that the league's desire to create healthier terms on which essentially unhealthy franchises could compete contributed to this season's lockout.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A small number of wealthy Canadian and U.S. franchises will continue to prop up the league's failed southern expansion strategy for some time yet. The league's $200-million revenue-sharing agreement provides that franchises contribute according to their means. Phoenix, because it is owned by the league, is exempt from having to show improvements in its fan support each year. And large-market franchises such as the <span class="companylink">Anaheim Ducks</span> and <span class="companylink">New York Islanders</span> will now be eligible for support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The league wants to be able to tell national U.S. broadcasters that it is in the biggest dozen TV markets. The most successful sports leagues are driven by television revenue, rather than by ticket sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians who balk at the southward flow of money, especially from Toronto (nearly $20-million last season), Montreal and Vancouver, should remember that the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> subsidized faltering Canadian franchises when this country's dollar was at roughly 60 cents (U.S.), not long ago. Canada's seven franchises now earn about 30 per cent of revenues in the 30-team league, but it was not always thus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The league's commissioner, Gary Bettman, won't let go of his southern dream, and Canadian fans are subsidizing it. Their attachment to their franchises is almost ludicrously powerful. An estimated 200 fans out of 100,000 cancelled their season tickets because of the four-month lockout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will their passionate attachment to hockey bring another franchise north? Not in the near future. Canadian fans remain the captive audience, outsiders at their own party.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A camel, goes the saying, is a horse designed by a committee. That's an apt metaphor for the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>'s decision last month on whether a woman should be allowed to hide her face behind a niqab while testifying in a courtroom.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The court was split, and the four-member majority finally reached a compromise – but what's a compromise that is unworkable and that will achieve nothing but a further muddling of the issue?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Incredibly, lower court judges will be required to determine the strength of the religious belief of the witness before deciding whether the witness can keep her niqab on. Why should judges be invited to probe into a person's deepest convictions on matters that have nothing to do with the trial over which they're presiding? In itself, this is an intolerable intrusion into private life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court</span> did not stop there. Lower court judges will be subjected to a series of painful checks bordering on the ridiculous. For instance, if there's no absolute proof that the right of the accused could be compromised by a niqab-wearing witness, the trial judge would have to take into consideration the “social context” and “the broader social harms” – whatever that means.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chances are that, at the end of the day, most trial judges will just let witnesses hide behind their niqab to be spared the trouble of morphing into amateur sociologists/theologians and risk having their verdict struck down by an appellate court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Far from being, as some say, a good old “Canadian compromise,” the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court</span>'s decision is a pusillanimous surrender that tramples on a fundamental principle of Canada's justice system: that everyone should be equal before the law and that, as dissenting Mr. Justice Louis LeBel wrote, “unbridled cross-examination lies at the core of trial proceedings.” This principle, of course, includes the possibility of evaluating the credibility of a witness by her facial expressions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, the arguments of Madam Justice Rosalie Abella, who supports the unfettered right to wear a niqab, are intellectually weak, to say the least. She says courts accommodate the special needs of witnesses who suffer from various handicaps. This is a ludicrous comparison. A niqab is not a handicap – it's something a woman inflicts on herself, a personal choice for which she must bear the consequences. Would a man be allowed to testify wearing a mask?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a matter of fact, the complainant in the Toronto sexual-assault trial that prompted the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court</span> decision has acknowledged that she would take off her niqab when she finds it convenient – to obtain a driver's licence, for example, or board a plane. Isn't the justice system at least as worthy of respect as airline security rules?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why should Canadian courts adapt to the customs of various fundamentalist groups (or, why not, of people who argue the sect they belong to is a religion)?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Muslims insist that the Koran doesn't force women to veil their faces and that this rule comes from a radical interpretation of the sacred book. In any case, whether or not the niqab is true Islam, there should be a limit to multiculturalism – a limit dictated by plain common sense and also by the need to maintain the neutrality of the state's institutions, the best way of guaranteeing religious freedom in a civil society. This is why judges and Crown prosecutors do not exhibit religious signs in court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, witnesses are not bound by the same rule, and are free to wear a cross or a kippa or a hijab – as long as their faces are not masked.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their mission Monday, it can now be revealed, was to promote a much ballyhooed show called The Face. It's a model-competition series starting next month on Oxygen, one of those channels that airs modelling-competition shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mind you, at the time, the trio did look like their true mission was to mimic the banshee figures of Celtic mythology and go about frightening people in the near-dawn hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've nothing against supermodels. Getting paid vast amounts of money to pose in clothes and glare angrily at the camera while doing so is one of those jobs that defy credibility but still exist. Well done to those who can get away with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Face, you should know, is not like America's Next Top Model. Totally, no way. For a start, it has Campbell, Kurkova and Rocha involved, not some losers. What happens, apparently, is that each supermodel chooses a posse of young wannabe models, trains them, and the posse members then compete to be the face of ULTA Beauty, a retail chain that peddles beauty products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look, people, it involves skinny women competing through tears and tantrums, and this is exactly the sort of thing that a lot of people want to see on TV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Campbell was prodded into explaining her mission with this new TV show, of which she is executive producer as well as a star. It is, she said, “to give back,” to pass on all that she has learned in 26 years of modelling. She is a role model, not just a model, you see. It is about taking good care of the aspiring models: “I'm not a shrink, a certified shrink, but I felt like one because I had to, like, be there to hear everything, their family history, their background, their tragedies, their ups and downs … I felt an overall protection to all the girls.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is all perfectly plausible, of course. Given her experience, Campbell has much to convey. And it would be very unkind to mention that her experience includes throwing a mobile phone at her personal assistant (she pleaded guilt to assault and was ordered to attend anger-management courses), assaulting her housekeeper (she pleaded guilty and was ordered to do community service) and being banned from flying on <span class="companylink">British Airways</span> because she spat at police officers at Heathrow airport (again, she pleaded guilty to assault and was fined and ordered to do community service). Perhaps because it would be unkind, nobody mentioned it. Or perhaps because of the presence of a very large security guard near Campbell, nobody mentioned it. Besides, it ill behooves mere mortals to mention such matters in the context of Campbell being a role model, not just a model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyhoo. Campbell was talking on and on about the “hopeful journey” of the aspiring models on The Face when Rocha, the Canadian among the trio of banshees, felt moved to direct our attention to the true meaning of The Face. It's all about rejection, apparently – the tragedy of rejection that is rampant in the modelling community, and the toll it takes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She made a heartfelt attempt to explain her point and addressed the TV critics directly, plaintively. “We were trying to teach these girls as well, because, honestly, when you guys get rejected, it's because of a story that you wrote, because it wasn't perfect, it didn't write correctly, whatever. But for us, you look at us and you go, ‘I don't like her nose.' That's it. That's why I didn't get the job. ‘I don't like her thighs.' That's it. And I'm thinking, well, I have so much more to give you. I have a brain. I have a personality. So we try and teach these girls that, although we love who you are, you have to have this thick skin, and especially when we're out there and we're looking on the blogs and seeing what people have to write about us, they go, ‘I don't care about their sad story. Look at their face.'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, that explained everything. Chastened, I looked down at the small, plastic clutch purse I had been given and, for a moment, I felt the pain that supermodels suffer. I used to think the TV racket was a cruel world. Shows fail. Actors don't get cast. A series ends up competing with The Big Bang Theory for viewers. Now I know that authentic, searing pain is known only by the tall, skinny and beautiful. Because somebody doesn't care for their nose or thighs. The lousy haters. It took a TV show featuring supermodels to teach me that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rarely have I been so moved. Or frightened. Oh, my shattered nerves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">P.S.: Rocha was wearing Thierry Mugler. I did ask her, from a safe distance. Access to Campbell and Kurkova was blocked by the large security guard.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accounting and auditing are diagnostic techniques. That is why Chief Theresa Spence of the Attawapiskat First Nation is gravely mistaken when she dismisses a very critical audit of the financial management of her reserve as “a distraction.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The money spent by the federal government at Attawapiskat is not outrageously high per person. The question is, rather, why the spending on basic needs is so ineffective. Everyone agrees that the community suffers from severe social and economic ills, especially in its defective housing. It is in the far north of Ontario, on James Bay, but the dwellings are not adequate for winter, and there is a lack of drinkable running water. No one has alleged misappropriation of funds, but the lack of basic bookkeeping has made it impossible to find out how the money has been allocated. It seems quite likely that nobody, literally nobody, knows.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, 2011, the federal government hired Deloitte and Touche LLP to audit its $104-million in transfers to Attawapiskat from 2005 to 2011. Deloitte's report makes some favourable conclusions on the overall co-operation between the community and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the devil was in the details. Most payments were unexplained, unclassified; more than 60 per cent of a sample of transactions lacked any explanation of what they were for, and 81 per cent were not adequately accounted for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly before the audit was initiated, the government appointed a “third-party” manager, Jacques Marion, a partner at another large accounting firm, BDO Canada. Chief Spence and the council of Attawapiskat responded by suing in the Federal Court. In August, 2012, Mr. Justice Michael Phelan held that an assistant deputy minister had gone too far in appointing Mr. Marion, because the problem was an operational one, not a matter of “financial tools.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, the Deloitte audit was not yet complete at the time; Judge Phelan might have decided differently. Good financial practices are certainly not everything, but they can help pinpoint problems. Accounting is not a sufficient condition for well-being, at Attawapiskat or anywhere else, but it is a necessity – and far from a distraction.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Government of Canada</span> will spend about $250-billion on all of its programs in 2013-2014. Put that in the context of the assertion made by a lawyer representing some of the Indian leaders who are meeting Prime Minister Stephen Harper on Friday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Jeffrey Rath, “indigenous people” are owed “tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars” by the federal government because of lands, resources and other materials taken from these “peoples.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The “hundreds of billions” figure is a guess. Could be more, could be less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who cares when everything is based on the assertion that most of us live on stolen land and, therefore, owe almost whatever money is demanded, plus penance and apologies and, of course, guilt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To these demands have now been added the claims of the Métis and non-status Indians, who, the Federal Court of Canada ruled on Tuesday (in a judgment that will almost certainly be appealed by the government), had the right to be treated in the same way as Indians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As there are 400,000 people who identify as Métis, the financial obligations on the federal and provincial governments could be extremely heavy, indeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back when the Charter of Rights was being negotiated in the early 1980s, it was obvious that the status Indian leadership and that of the Métis were superficially polite to each other but deeply distrustful. The Indians did not consider the Métis to be fully Indian (as, indeed, they were not and are not), and the groups' treatment experiences within Canada had been different. The Métis, however, saw similarities where status Indians did not, and were anxious that the status Indians not receive constitutional protection that escaped them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now the Federal Court says, in essence, that the two groups were treated sufficiently the same, and were lumped together by governments many decades ago, so they should be considered in a similar fashion today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which will mean endless negotiations, considerable litigation and, if the Métis are ultimately successful, a huge additional financial obligation on the government that status Indians can only hope doesn't come from what they're receiving. If, indeed, the government owes the Indians “hundreds of billions” of dollars, according to one of their lawyers, what might Métis lawyers demand?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, a large number of Métis have integrated into what we might call mainstream society. So we will now be treated, in ways the judge hinted at but didn't define (how could he?), to procedures by which a Métis person is to be defined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What definition will be used in terms of what share of ancestry was aboriginal, and how long ago? Who's to say who's a Métis: the claimant, or some adjudicating board?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obviously, it will be important to know when allocating benefits, just as it is for any other government program. A person can't claim to be entitled to a pension without proving age or citizenship with documentation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not a judge's business to worry about public reaction, but this ruling, should it be upheld, is likely to prove highly controversial, to put matters mildly. The Métis who wanted this designation will be delighted; they have fought for their sense of justice in constitutional negotiations and courtrooms for more than three decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The judgment, however, lands at a particularly delicate moment, what with the Idle No More movement, demonstrations, the failure by police to enforce court injunctions, an inflamed sense of aboriginal oppression, Chief Theresa Spence's hunger strike, and garbled accounting records all making the news, not to mention the meeting on Friday between some chiefs and the Prime Minister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the obeisance paid to the rituals of multiculturalism, the majority of Canadian society is extremely integrationist – far more so than the United States or Europe – within the two broad streams of French- and English-language groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citizens who have joined, or are seeking as immigrants to join, the broad Canadian mainstream are likely to be themselves confused and resentful on being told they owe “hundreds of billions” of dollars, along with restitution and guilt; and that the Métis and non-status Indians have now joined status Indians on an equal footing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday, January 11, 2013</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian pension plans have age but not citizenship requirements. The Old Age Security requires that someone be a citizen or legal resident and the Canada Pension plan requires that someone has worked in Canada and made at least one payment to the plan. A column published Monday incorrectly said proof of citizenship was a requirement for a pension.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lamb shanks are a great treat and easy to serve for a dinner party. Made several days ahead, they improve as they sit. Shanks take well to spicing from many regions, but my favourite are Indian flavours, since the spices cut through the richness and give the shanks a more balanced taste.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the constitution, if the president-elect is unable to take the oath because of an “absolute” absence, he must be replaced with the president of the National Assembly and new elections held. If the “absolute” absence takes place after he's sworn in, the vice-president replaces the president and calls new elections. With the argument that Mr. Chavez is only “temporarily” absent, his officials are furiously manoeuvring to keep him as president. This week, they decided to “postpone” the swearing-in ceremony that should have taken place on Jan. 10 (Venezuela's top court endorsed the delay on Wednesday) in what looks like an open violation of the constitution, given that Mr. Chavez's absence bears the hallmarks of a permanent condition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behind the scenes, Mr. Maduro and Diosdado Cabello, a former army lieutenant who presides over the National Assembly, are struggling for the succession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Maduro has the support of three sources of power linked to Mr. Chavez: the President's elder daughter, Rosa Virginia, and her husband, Science and Technology Minister Jorge Arreaza, both of whom have assumed great influence during the leader's cancer drama; Cuba, a close ally of Venezuela that considers Mr. Maduro the most reliable heir; and Rafael Ramírez, the head of <span class="companylink">Petróleos de Venezuela SA</span>, the oil giant. At the cost of reducing its productivity by 20 per cent, Mr. Ramírez keeps milking the <span class="companylink">PDVSA</span> cow that's the lifeblood of the regime. Last year, out of a total of $125-billion in sales, $24-billion were channelled to the government as taxes and royalties and $30-billion directly to Mr. Chavez's discretionary fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cabello, meanwhile, has ascendancy over the military – he took part in the coup attempt led by Mr. Chavez against a legitimate government back in 1992, and has involved the army in social programs. He has some legitimacy because he helped reverse an overthrow of Mr. Chavez in 2002 and is close to the “Bolivarian” oligarchy. But he will have a hard time going against Mr. Maduro – it would mean disobeying the caudillo's plans and forcing the military to use massive force against a predictable backlash from the popular base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A retired officer, Mr. Cabello has no direct command of troops. Mr. Chavez recently promoted General Carlos Alcalá as commander of the army and Wilmer Barrientos as head of the Operational Strategic Command in order to dilute the power of other officers with prolonged tenures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also ensured that 11 of the 24 state governors recently elected were former members of the military – a way to disperse military power as well as strengthen the military-civilian entente.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does this mean Mr. Maduro will prevail? Only in the short run. Beyond that, the regime is doomed. No one commands the control and popularity that Mr. Chavez enjoyed. The economy is dismal: Inflation is running at 25 per cent and an imminent devaluation will fuel it further. There was no economic growth in 2011 and, last year, it was artificially generated thanks to a colossal fiscal deficit (amounting to more than 16 per cent of GDP). Government debt is 10 times larger than when Mr. Chavez came to power. The populist mirage that has made it possible for Venezuelans to fill up their gas tanks for less than $1 and to import ever-increasing amounts of goods and services while producing little will end sooner rather than later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Social conditions, including the fourth-highest homicide rate in the world, necessitate that the populist machinery run smoothly. If it doesn't, with the Chavez charisma out of the way, there will be little love left for the minions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the opposition will get a fair chance anytime soon is another matter. Mr. Maduro and Mr. Cabello could stick together for a while. Terrified of score settling, the military could fire on the populace should the streets fill with anti-government demonstrators. And it can't be ruled out that one of the leaders vying for control will make overtures to the opposition to negotiate a transition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the case, the messy post-Chavez era has begun while the caudillo nears judgment day in Havana.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once Leaf Nation got over the shock of Wednesday's stunning front-office shuffle, there was really one question left on everybody's mind. Did Brian Burke's dismissal make it more or less likely that the <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span> would move forward on a possible deal with the <span class="companylink">Vancouver Canucks</span> for goaltender Roberto Luongo?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Logically, the answer is far more likely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Luongo ultimately has the last word on a final destination because he has a no-trade clause in his contract and the <span class="companylink">Florida Panthers</span> appear to be his team of choice, for personal and professional reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Canucks' general manager Mike Gillis also has a responsibility to make the best possible deal that he can for his organization – and you'd have to think that right now, the Maple Leafs could offer the sweetest combination of players, especially to remedy the issue that Vancouver has at centre, with the injured Ryan Kesler still on the shelf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, Gillis was asked if Burke's firing would affect Luongo trade talks one way or the othe and said, “ Not in my mind.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gillis also said the window on a Luongo trade will not open until the weekend after the players ratify the new deal. “Then it begins,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You always had the sense that Burke resisted a trade for Luongo for the same reasons that he didn't move to improve his goaltending last year at the NHL trading deadline, when it was eminently clear that netminding was the weakest link on a team whose promising start evaporated during a second-half collapse. There were veteran goaltending options available last March, too, that Burke didn't act upon, moves that might have got the Leafs into the playoffs had he gone in that direction soon enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burke can be stubborn that way. He held onto coach Ron Wilson out of loyalty, long after it became clear that Wilson's shelf life with the Leafs had expired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was Burke's way. Even if everybody around him was saying one thing, he clung to his beliefs. He is a man of courage and conviction, even if logic sometimes suggested a different path was in order.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his mind, the Leafs' goaltending would eventually come around – although you'd have to think that François Allaire's departure as the goalie coach indicated that Burke did recognize that something needed to be done there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So now, here is Dave Nonis, the new general manager, who has that well-documented history with Luongo. As Burke's successor in Vancouver, Nonis's best move was acquiring Luongo from the Panthers for a package of players – Todd Bertuzzi, Bryan Allen and Alex Auld – that didn't do a thing to help Florida. But in Vancouver, Luongo's steadiness in goal helped the Canucks evolve into a bonafide Stanley Cup contender – and got them all the way to the seventh game of the Stanley Cup final two years ago. They have had five 100-point seasons in the past six years; and won five division crowns along the way, making them by far the most successful Canadian franchise in that time span – and Luongo had a lot to do with their success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, Burke lost his job primarily because the new ownership at Maple Leafs Sports and Entertainment wanted a new calmer, more corporate, face for the franchise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Anselmi, the chief operating officer, said as much, noting the decision to remove Burke was “more about tone and the voice of leadership than changing gears and going in a different direction.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonis made that point, too – that the Leafs were not prepared to go back to the starting line, even with the change in the manager's chair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“To turn around and gut the franchise now would set it back a long way,” Nonis said, “and it is not something anybody has any interest in doing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No, but they are interested in wheeling and dealing as soon the new labour pact is ratified and teams get the green light from the NHL to start making trades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonis made one other interesting observation about the state of the team – how the Leafs had some “good building blocks, but some of those building blocks are aren't ready to play right away. We have to buy ourselves some time until the younger players come along.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing buys a team time like the presence of a quality, experienced No. 1 goaltender. Nothing makes a team more competitive in the short term than solidifying its goaltending. You'd have to think that whatever qualms Burke may have had about moving forward on a Luongo trade, Nonis wouldn't share the same concerns. And if the Leafs land Luongo before the start of the season, that alone would change the on-ice dynamic more than any front-office shuffle possibly could.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firing of Brian Burke proved one thing – no matter who owns the <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span>, sooner or later they succumb to Harold Ballard disease.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It doesn't matter if that owner is individual or corporate, once they take charge there is an inevitable descent into the dark comedy that marked Ballard's ownership through the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burke's removal as president and general manager has the fingerprints of the newest owners, <span class="companylink">Rogers Communications Inc</span>., and <span class="companylink">BCE Inc</span>., all over it, rather than Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd. chairman Larry Tanenbaum. Several NHL governors said the word going around the room Wednesday when they met to approve the new collective agreement was that Burke's abrasive and loud public style rubbed BCE and Rogers suits the wrong way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also hanging over the decision was the long shadow of Roberto Luongo. The consensus among the same hockey executives and some NHL GMs was the stalled trade talks for the <span class="companylink">Vancouver Canucks</span> goaltender were at the very least the final straw in the decision to fire Burke and replace him with senior vice-president of hockey operations David Nonis 10 days before the lockout-shortened season began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burke was not keen to meet the asking price of Canucks GM Mike Gillis for Luongo. Nonis and the other Leaf executives are said to be more willing to get a deal done. Gillis said Burke's firing won't affect the talks one way or the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But no one saw this coming this quickly. Washington Capitals general manager George McPhee, whose worked with and against Burke for years, said he was talking to Burke on Tuesday night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burke was bubbling with enthusiasm with his plans for the season, said McPhee, who was not, by the way, one of the people who shared the information about the opinions of Burke's bosses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tanenbaum, who had the job of informing Burke of the decision early Wednesday morning, seemed as gobsmacked as everyone else. That included Nonis, who has now replaced his long-time friend twice after firings. The first time was with the Canucks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tanenbaum does not like speaking to the media but he was especially uncomfortable Wednesday when he arrived at the governors meeting to find a group of media waiting for him outside the hotel. While he is usually polite in brushing aside media queries, Tanenbaum was brusque this time. “It was a decision of the board,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The MLSE chairman was so flustered and eager to escape the reporters he turned to a revolving door that was covered by yellow tape and closed. He pushed at it for a second then turned and rushed down the street to the next entrance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burke's record since taking the job on Nov. 29, 2008, was 129-135-42 and no playoff games, continuing a postseason drought dating to 2004. That is not a gold-plated record, to be sure, but no sensible hockey organization fires the GM on the eve of a new season. This does not bode well for Rogers' and BCE's ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are going to change direction, it is done far enough into a season that the playoffs are out of reach or immediately after the season. This gives the new boss a chance to get his program in place before the next season starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On top of that, any seasoned hockey executive will tell you a GM deserves at least five full seasons to show if his approach is going to be successful. <span class="companylink">Detroit Red Wings</span> GM Ken Holland, whose cluster of Stanley Cup rings show he might know a thing or two about this, argues in a salary cap world, where that restriction means it takes years to undo a predecessor's mistakes, it should be 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rogers and BCE officially took over MLSE last August after their purchase of the company in December of 2011. That gave BCE chairman George Cope and his Rogers counterpart, Nadir Mohamed, lots of time to decide if Burke was their man.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If they were going to fire him without giving him the decency of five seasons to prove himself, last September was the time to do it. Especially with the league idle because of the lockout, which would give the new person lots of time to put his own touch on a team many GMs and scouts around the league say will be a playoff contender if it gets a good goaltender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, Burke's gruff exterior ruffles a lot of feathers. But he is a man of integrity and a good heart who made the Leafs better while enduring a personal tragedy that would have flattened a lot of others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He deserved better than this.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mali is in a mess. Last March, a military coup overthrew a democratic government there; a combination of Tuareg rebels, al-Qaeda jihadis and former Gadhafi mercenaries took advantage of the chaos to take over northern Mali and institute a jihadi regime.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Dec. 20, <span class="companylink">the United Nations</span> Security Council urged member states to help quash the uprising. Canada was apparently asked to help, but Prime Minister Stephen Harper has decided against any Canadian intervention in Mali. Sooner or later, however, Ottawa will again be asked to contribute to some seemingly worthwhile military mission. Any decision regarding the deployment of Canadian troops should be based on lessons learned – some of them bitter ones – from our involvement in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most important consideration is how prepared the federal government is to explain the mission to Canadians. It must tell the nation plainly why Canada should be involved and why the possible loss of Canadian life will be a necessary sacrifice to Canadian interests and/or values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This will be particularly hard for Ottawa to do, because few Canadians know anything about Africa – except possibly for its interminable civil wars, atrocities and even genocides. Nevertheless, it must be done, not only in a full debate in Parliament that culminates in a parliamentary resolution to send troops, but in regular consultations with Canadians to make sure the doings of their troops are always transparent. Without the support of Canadians, the mission won't be sustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa should have a clear idea of the political objectives of the larger military mission and should do its own evaluation as to whether they're achievable while guarding against the “mission creep” that tends to inflate small missions into big ones. It's simply not good enough to base Canadian decision-making on French or American (or UN) evaluations alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also important for Ottawa to know what other countries will contribute and, in particular, whether the United States will assume the lead role is supplying airlift, communications and logistics support. The U.S. has more carrying capacity than all the “Western” nations combined; supply lines by air (necessary for the landlocked country) will be a key component of any military operation there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Afghanistan, we learned the hard way that military coalitions can be very loose and uneven in their command structures, with different philosophies, rules of engagement, standard operating procedures, levels of training and quality and compatibility of equipment among coalition members. Is Canada prepared to tolerate that reality?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada should insist on full disclosure from its military allies on what operational and strategic plans they're making and should have a say in shaping those plans. Whether Canada sends 10 people or 500, all those Canadians are Ottawa's responsibility and all need to be protected against their misuse by our allies or against poor strategic decision-making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa should make very sure of the human and physical geography of the area that Canadian troops might be operating in and know what dangers (such as open borders offering sanctuary to an enemy) lie in the offing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa should also realistically assess the costs of the operation and how those costs will be paid for. The government must not take the funds for any new military mission out of the Department of National Defence's already stretched budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada has good reasons for saying no to a mission in Mali. The war in Afghanistan is not quite over for Canada – about 900 troops will remain there for another year or so – while the military (especially the army) badly needs rest and re-equipment after a decade of war. The country is battling debt and deficit, and the defence budget has been drastically curtailed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Harper's stand reflects another reality: It's a sobering, but necessary, reminder to Canadians that, no matter how worthy a cause may be, our capacity to battle evil everywhere and in any form is quite limited.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, the vagaries of the network-TV racket. The boasting and the busted promises.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the principal attractions of the mid-season TV press tour is the opportunity to assess how the major U.S. broadcasters are doing, midway through their selling season. Few other industries require the top execs to turn up, face critics and justify their decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First up was Robert Greenblatt, chairman of NBC Entertainment. He appeared for us, all relaxed and everything, and said, “What a difference a year makes. Last year I came here right off the top and said we had a bad fall. I'm not saying that this year.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">True enough. <span class="companylink">NBC</span> has been the No. 4 network for years. This TV season, so far, its audience has grown 19 per cent, putting it second overall behind CBS. In younger viewers coveted by advertisers, it is in first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are three reasons for this, all of them examples of how mercurial success in network TV has become. We'll get to those in a minute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, there are <span class="companylink">NBC</span>'s plans for the immediate future. The dramas, comedies and reality shows that will be surefire hits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, Michael J. Fox pitched them a comedy show about a guy in the media biz with a Parkinson's-like disease who is dealing with his family, job and illness. It's based on his real-life experience, obviously. The show is only in development and a first reading by actors will take place this week. That's nice, and an attention-grabber if it actually makes it to the <span class="companylink">NBC</span> schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a show going into production about Dracula, starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers from The Tudors. That's nice too, and Meyers is a sexy fella admired by lady viewers. But it's also possible that by the time it airs, the whole vampire thing will be so over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the short term, <span class="companylink">NBC</span> has just launched Deception (Mondays, 10 p.m.). The fact that the drama, a murder mystery set among the super-rich, was formerly titled Infamous, and before that, Notorious, tells you that <span class="companylink">NBC</span> even struggles with titles. Clearly meant to piggyback on the popularity of ABC's tangled drama Revenge, it debuted this week to mixed reviews. As in “awful,” “too generic” and “unintentionally hilarious.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also a new drama based around the serial-killer Hannibal Lecter character, but Greenblatt vaguely tells us, “It might air before the end of this season.” The subtext being that a new sensitivity about violence on TV might keep the show on the shelf for a very long time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Returning soon is Smash, the most high-profile and promoted of <span class="companylink">NBC</span>'s dramas last season. About the ins-and-outs of staging a Broadway musical on Marilyn Monroe, it's a pet project of Greenblatt, who has much Broadway experience on his résumé.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smash was no smash hit last year and several people charged with running the series left it. Now it is getting a major reboot, with new writers and cast members. What's odd about Smash is that for a series about the messy side of making a musical, it is formidably bland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What <span class="companylink">NBC</span> has going for it right now, and what has put it up there in second place, is The Voice, NFL football and the drama Revolution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that The Voice is a singing reality show that can only be milked for ratings for a short period. Another problem is that the looming Super Bowl brings the end of the NFL season and, with it, bumper viewer numbers for <span class="companylink">NBC</span>. The third problem is that Revolution is off the air until mid-March, when it returns at last with new episodes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In network TV nothing beats a strong stable of hit shows watched week after week. <span class="companylink">NBC</span> doesn't have that. Sports and singing shows only deliver temporary success. A block of dramas and comedy is the concrete foundation of network success. <span class="companylink">NBC</span>'s success is built on quicksand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much depends on Revolution, one of the very few new shows on any network to muster a sizable audience. It hovers just outside the Top 10 most-watched shows of the 2012/13 season and if it can hold on to its audience and move into the Top 10, it will be a major success for <span class="companylink">NBC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Set in a postapocalyptic future devoid of electricity, it's one if those shows that has a peculiar, multilayered appeal. On the one hand it has elements of The Hunger Games, and a young, attractive cast on a tension-filled journey of survival and discovery. On the other hand, it's a show that, unintentionally, appeals to people in search of simpler times and simpler pleasures. When the cast and producers met the critics here, a continuing theme was the show's emphasis on a world without cellphones, laptops and TVs. Giancarlo Esposito, who plays a bad guy, claimed that the show had inspired him and his family to spend Christmas without cellphones, computers and TV. “We talked. We sat. We looked at each other. We put down our technology. That came directly from the inspiration of what this show has done in my life.” Creator J.J. Abrams echoed the theme, saying he was learning to do without communications technology for days at a time, because the show made him think about that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is an interesting angle to Revolution, but it suggests that it has a certain gimmicky appeal. More time was spent talking about the no-technology angle than about the show's substance and storylines. Abrams co-created Lost, and Revolution is not Lost. It's a thin, surface-appeal series, and by the time it returns in March a portion of its fan base might have discovered something else to watch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, there's a connection between the appeal of Revolution and <span class="companylink">NBC</span>'s plight. There are so many alternatives to network TV that the audience is ever more fickle. These are not simpler times. They are more competitive and complex times.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time caught up to Brian Burke on Wednesday morning. It's one thing when a general manager lets himself be branded as the face of a winning team, quite another when he's still the face of an NHL franchise after four years without a playoff spot.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that Burke's firing as Toronto Maple Leafs general manager could come as a palpable shock speaks to the larger-than-life quality of the man and screams the failure of his tenure. That Burke was still very much the face of the franchise when he was fired – more than his leading scorer, Phil Kessel, or his captain, Dion Phaneuf – reinforced what a waste the past four Leafs seasons have been.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd. is no longer run by a benign pension plan; it is controlled by two media conglomerates that have signalled they intend to play an activist role on the MLSE board, with a clear sense of image and product. It is controlled, now, by businessmen unafraid to can somebody when stuff goes awry; by people smart enough to look at what Burke wrought and come to an inescapable conclusion: You mean that after four years, this is all we have?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody doubts that Burke had some seriously heavy lifting to do when he took over the Leafs job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But you have to be a blind Burke loyalist to wonder if it really should take that long to make the playoffs in this market in a league in which 16 of 30 teams advance to the playoffs. Not only did Burke not deliver results, he didn't even deliver the type of truculent hockey which he so bravely promised, instead icing teams that always seemed out of step with their head coach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while the playoffs went on without the Leafs, there was Burke making this pronouncement or that pronouncement, all bluster and picking fights and leading with his chin while he was instituting his own make-believe trade deadline. That was okay when the MLSE board was run by people who would take “because I know more about it than you do,” for an answer; not so much when <span class="companylink">BCE Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Rogers Communications Inc</span>. put their people in place and need to market cellular telephones and services and television and radio product, as <span class="companylink">Toronto Raptors</span> GM Bryan Colangelo appears to be finding out, as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The timing of Wednesday's announcement is puzzling, and immediately led to speculation about untidy personal matters or an imminent trade of goaltender Roberto Luongo, the thinking being that Burke's replacement, David Nonis, is more than Burke to strike a deal with <span class="companylink">Vancouver Canucks</span> GM Mike Gillis; that whatever animus exists between Nonis and Gillis manageable compared to the toxicity of Burke's relationship with the Canucks GM. Perhaps there is an element of truth to those hypotheses; or perhaps the timing was dictated by the end of the NHL lockout and the beginning of a jury-rigged schedule next Saturday. What's another shock to the system after what we've all been through, eh?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At any rate, Toronto sports fans who have been wondering whether the sale of the <span class="companylink">Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan</span> shares in MLSE to rival broadcasters simply meant exchanging one group of Tory blue suits for another now have an answer. Of course the new board will talk about being committed to winning. That's motherhood; it's a sports version of apple pie. The proof will come on the ice, the soccer pitch and the basketball court, but it is hard not to see Wednesday's move as a positive sign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The simple fact is the people who own MLSE thought they deserved better than what Burke had delivered, and looking beyond some of the charms of the man – the loyalty, the civic awareness and sensibilities and the raw emotion that comes from wanting to win so badly it hurts – it's hard to argue with the choice. Matter of fact, the real question might be: what took you so long?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don Cherry has done it again. The obnoxious loudmouth wants to know why we're wasting money by sending it to Haiti, one of the most blighted nations on Earth. “Are we nuts?” he tweeted the other day. That was his reaction to the news that Canada is “reviewing” its Haiti strategy because our International Co-operation Minister, Julian Fantino, doesn't think we're getting enough bang for our buck.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personally, I can think of quite a few reasons to help Haiti. Canadians are kind and generous, and Haiti is close to home. More than 90,000 Haitians – including our wildly popular former governor-general, Michaëlle Jean – live in Canada. Haiti is also a wrenching hard-luck story, devastated by earthquake, plagued by cholera and now threatened with hunger after Hurricane Sandy washed away most of the year's crops. Haitians don't deserve this. Nobody does.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it pains me to admit that Mr. Cherry has a point. Haiti is a hard country to help. Three years after Port-au-Prince was flattened by a quake, Haiti's reconstruction has barely started. More than 350,000 people still live in tents. They still don't have clean water, toilets or electricity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not for lack of good intentions. Bill Clinton, <span class="companylink">the United Nations</span> special envoy for Haiti, urged donors to take a new approach to aid. The aim was not merely to provide emergency relief but to “build back better” by creating the infrastructure, health programs and jobs needed to turn the country into a functioning state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donors enthusiastically pledged $5.3-billion to transform Haiti. Soon, there were no fewer than 9,000 NGOs at work there, more than in any country but India. The <span class="companylink">World Bank</span> and the <span class="companylink">U.S. Agency for International Development</span> plunged in. Canada stepped up, too; Haiti became its largest recipient of foreign aid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, the donors pledged not to repeat the same old mistakes. This time, someone would be in charge. Because the Haitian government was weak and unstable, a special commission, co-chaired by Mr. Clinton and the Haitian prime minister, was created to oversee the recovery efforts. Jean-Marie Bourjolly, a Haitian-Canadian technology professor, was one of the commissioners. “You need concerted effort, co-ordination and planning to solve the problem, because the problem is global,” he told me. “Clinton had all the power he needed. Unfortunately, he didn't do anything.” The commission wound down 18 months later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, it's doubtful that any master plan could have rescued Haiti. The country lacks basic property rights and land title, which means no one knows who owns what. The government can't deliver basic services. International officials, sensitive to being perceived as neo-colonials, tried to defer to the Haitians, but the Haitians felt the end run anyway. They stood by as foreigners raced around in SUVs and squandered huge amounts on overhead. Nearly all the money spent on redevelopment went to foreign contractors. Only 1 per cent of the aid money flowed through the Haitian government. Then UN soldiers from Nepal set off a cholera epidemic when their feces leaked into a local river, killing more than 7,500 people and sickening hundreds of thousands more. The epidemic made Haitians even more resentful of foreign intervention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Afghanistan, Haiti is a hard country to help. Canada spent $1.5-billion in aid in Afghanistan with no discernible result. We've spent $1-billion on development in Haiti since 2006. Some of the money has gone for emergency relief, and no one would begrudge that. But the idea that we – or anyone else – know how to “get Haiti right” is a cruel joke. It's just another version of the conceit that enlightened foreigners can lift up the world's backward people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I don't want to leave you with the notion that nothing can be done and that Haitians are doomed. In fact, Haitians do very well – outside Haiti. And they're a huge source of remittances, which go directly to Haitians themselves. This money amounts to about $1.5-billion a year. If we really wanted to help Haiti, we'd open our doors to Haitian emigration; that would cost us almost nothing, and improve the lives of all the new arrivals as well as the relatives who stay behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, we might not get that warm and fuzzy feeling. But we might actually do some good.</p>
