<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consternation is the order of the day in Ottawa and Alberta. U.S. President Barack Obama has rediscovered climate change as a priority. The federal and Alberta governments have been caught flat-footed.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither has assigned a high priority to climate change. They assumed that, since the issue was scarcely raised in the U.S. election campaign, Mr. Obama shared their lack of enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wrong. In his inaugural speech and the State of the Union address, Mr. Obama spent many paragraphs pledging action on carbon emissions, making a moral case for action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, along comes U.S. Ambassador David Jacobson seeking out Canadian media interviews. An ambassador doesn't look for interviews just because he feels like talking. The <span class="companylink">State Department</span> and the White House must approve their man going public and work out what he is going to say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jacobson did not mention the Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry Alberta's bitumen oil to the Gulf of Mexico, but he was talking about it nonetheless. He was sending perhaps two messages about Keystone: Either it isn't likely to be built and Canada should prepare for a rejection; or, if the pipeline is to be approved, the U.S. needs some concrete action from Canada to smooth the way in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ambassadors of friendly countries usually don't blindside their hosts, so chances are the Canadian (and perhaps the Alberta) government had some inkling of what was coming. Maybe his message might even be helpful, provided Canadians can get beyond the “How dare he” stance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, Stephen Harper's government has been promising to introduce regulations on emissions for the oil and gas industry for so long that people have forgotten when the promising began. That lobby has beaten away almost all serious attempts by governments to get emissions down rather than simply slowing their increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It ought to have been the policy of the industry and the governments to treat emissions from the bitumen industry the same as those from conventional oil. That way, at least some critics could have been disarmed. Instead, the industry and its clients in the Alberta and Ottawa governments preferred incremental steps and heaps of public relations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They just assumed that pipelines to the West Coast and through the United States were so evidently in everybody's self-interest that they would be built. The Harper government shared that perspective, declaring that opposition to the Enbridge pipeline through British Columbia was stirred up by U.S. environmentalists and that, as Prime Minister Stephen Harper inelegantly said, Keystone was a “no-brainer” in the U.S. Alberta's new representative in Washington suggested that the province needed to do more – and was promptly slapped down by his bosses in Edmonton, even though he had spoken the truth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the industry finds itself troubled on all sides – by environmental concerns, by aboriginals who don't want pipelines through northern British Columbia, by the B.C. government, by new oil discoveries in the United States and by shifting energy supplies courtesy of shale gas. In other words, the ground was shifting beneath the industry's feet even before the Obama emphasis on combatting climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alberta, at the civil service level and among intelligent policy analysts, it's been known for some time that the province's $15-a-tonne tax on emissions for companies that do not reduce them below a certain level is too low. It needs to be raised to a) be seen as credible, b) put more money into the technology fund and c) demonstrate an awareness that climate change is real, as Mr. Obama has passionately explained and as even Mr. Harper has grudgingly acknowledged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Messages from abroad can be irritating and unwelcome, but they can also galvanize domestic action. It's easy to tell the Americans to mind their own business. It's comforting to point to America's own inadequate record on emissions. Those complaints don't explain Canada's record. They don't help prepare Canada to cope with whatever action the Obama administration takes. After all, the Harper government's mantra has always been that Canada will move in lockstep with the Americans – whose President, it would appear, wants to move.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years now, people have been saying we need to have an adult conversation about how to pay for better transit in Toronto. Well, we're having it now. The city is buzzing with talk about revenue streams and dedicated taxes.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City Hall is in the first phase of an elaborate, three-part consultation exercise designed to wake Torontonians up to the transit challenge and get them to help choose how – or whether – they want to be taxed. It's called Feeling Congested? Toronto Talks Transportation, and organizers have been holding public meetings around the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metrolinx, the provincial transit agency, has been holding parallel roundtables, called Join the Big Conversation. The <span class="companylink">Toronto Region Board of Trade</span> is promising to “advance the conversation” by backing a preferred set of revenue tools – taxes, to you and me – to pay for transit. The Greater Toronto CivicAction Alliance has a campaign called “What would you do with 32?” that invites people to think about all the time they could save – 32 minutes, on average – if we build more transit and prevent commuting gridlock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is any of this really going to make any difference? To look on the bright side for a minute, it's encouraging that so much energy is going into a search for solutions to what is perhaps Toronto's biggest challenge for the coming decades: how to avoid strangling on its own growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All these talking shops spring from a broad, now nearly universal, consensus that the city has dropped the ball on transportation. Traffic congestion is growing. The TTC is bursting at the seams. Across the city you hear the cry: something must be done. “For too long, we have been teased with lofty plans and colourful presentations that ended up collecting dust on government shelves,” board of trade chief executive Carol Wilding wrote in The Globe and Mail earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those plans, Metrolinx's Big Move, is priced at a staggering $34-billion. How on Earth does a province that is struggling with high debt and deficits, or a city that is fighting to control costs, come up with that kind of money?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a Feeling Congested? meeting at City Hall this week, participants were asked to place a green sticker beside the funding option they preferred. Sales tax? Parking levy? Property-tax increase? Highways tolls?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is surely a good thing that people are being invited to have a say on this crucial question, especially considering that it could cost them a lot of money. Raising the $2-billion a year needed for the Big Move would ding the average household $600 if it was done through a hike in the personal income tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, though, small groups of concerned citizens will not make this call. Political leaders will. Are they bold enough to tell voters: I will tax you for better transit? Kathleen Wynne, the new Premier, gave some reason for hope when she said recently that she was willing to consider new revenue sources to pay for transit, even if it involved “political risk.” Tim Hudak, the Tory leader, was more careful when he spoke to the board of trade on Wednesday. He said he wanted to root out waste in the provincial government before asking taxpayers for more money. But he also said in the cold type of a news release that, when that was done, he would seek advice from voters on a “clear, dedicated, predictable source of funding.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A hopeful person would note that at least all of the talk is heading in the same direction – toward a recognition that government will have to raise more money to pay for transit and that some sort of dedicated tax or levy, directed specifically and solely to transit projects, is the way to go. A cautious person would note that, so far, it is all just talk.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once upon a time I lived in a flat next door to Bryan Ferry's west London recording studio. It was a basement apartment with high ceilings, and enormous windows facing the sidewalk. All day long I'd sit at my desk, watching an endless succession of legs swish by, my eyes at knee level, like a pervert.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I first heard about the studio, hidden in the pretty redbrick Victorian townhouse next door, because a girlfriend tipped me off. She'd been at school with Ferry's girlfriend (now wife), a gorgeous twentysomething publicist named Amanda Sheppard, whom the former Roxy Music singer reportedly met while she was dating one of his sons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was then (and remain) a big Bryan Ferry fan. His new record, The Jazz Age, a cover album of his old Roxy Music hits refashioned as jazz numbers, is nothing short of delicious – an audible glass of Champagne. Who'd have thought Avalon set to orchestral trumpet-led bebop would work as a piece of music, let alone sustain an entire album as a concept? But it does. And like the rest of Ferry's artistic output, it manages to be marvellously inventive and pleasantly comforting at the same time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That fine balance is Ferry's way. British interior designer Nicky Haslam once commented that Ferry was much more likely to redecorate a hotel room than to trash it. And I suppose it was this sense of elegant restraint, combined with musical genius, that made me so delighted to have him as a neighbour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I used to see him out my window from time to time. I came to recognize his collection of snappy leather brogues, which invariably led up to a pair of slim-cut wool trousers, tailored just so. If I moved close to the window, laid my face against the glass, and looked up, I could sometimes see the whole man. Usually it was just a glimpse, as he jumped into or out of a black cab; but occasionally he'd linger on the corner, sharing a cigarette with one of the young sessional musicians or backup singers who always seemed to be coming and going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was a year I buried myself in work, and as a result, I rarely left the flat. For a time, Ferry – and my imaginary adventures with him around London – were my main contact with the outside world. I started playing Roxy Music's greatest-hits album over and over, the soft-focus saxophone and synth tracks transporting me back to the early-eighties suburban dreamscape of my childhood. Sometimes I opened the windows in the hope he might overhear his songs and strike up a conversation. But if I saw him coming, I'd get embarrassed and run around the room slamming all the windows shut. This is the psychological conflict of having a pop star next door: You want to be cool and blasé about it, but at the same time you're dying for them to invite you over for tea and a round of Guitar Hero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Ferry, that never happened. But listening to his new album, I am reminded all over again of the magic he creates. It is not the magic of sex and drugs and danger that characterizes much of the pop music from his time, but one of gentler, grown-up pleasures: a crisp white Burgundy sipped in a well-designed armchair next to a crackling fire. Dinner jacket optional.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a fundamentally bourgeois person – I enjoy every aspect of dinner parties, and have never seen a countertop I didn't want to wipe – I am comforted by the existence of Bryan Ferry. He is living proof that it is possible to be simultaneously tidy and proper and artistically cutting-edge at the same time. His career is the embodiment of the famous Gustave Flaubert instruction to “be regular and orderly in your life… so that you may be violent and original in your work.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I no longer live in that basement flat. Like a typical bourgeois, I myself have moved on. But I think of him often: Those Roxy Music hits – original; and new, jazz covers – are still the soundtrack to my humdrum (and occasionally creative) working life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are those in Britain who consider Ferry a class traitor (he grew up working-class before sending his children to Eton, and now campaigns for the fox hunt and supports David Cameron's Tories), but that doesn't bother me. I don't need to agree with Ferry's stance on welfare reform to enjoy his music. His concerns, both creative and aesthetic, are essentially ephemeral and apolitical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is, in a sense, the modern-day Mrs. Dalloway of pop music. You won't hear a Roxy Music lyric slagging the Queen or constructing a naive vision for world peace. Avalon, in particular, is the musical equivalent of a truly successful dinner party: pleasurable, relaxing and stimulating to the senses, without being in any way difficult or challenging. This is not music that's trying to change the world, and yet it does so, if only by making it incrementally lovelier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Sheen endured 18 months of craziness shooting Apocalypse Now in the Philippines circa 1976, their 11-year-old sons Roman Coppola and Charlie Sheen were having the time of their lives, running around the jungle and hanging out in Colonel Kurtz's compound. “The set wasn't fibreglass and balsa wood, it was a real temple and a real village, and the company brought in real Ifugao tribespeople to live there,” Roman recalled in a recent phone interview. He and Charlie roved among the severed heads and staked skulls that decorated the set; they painted scars on each other with skills learned from the makeup crew; and when the Ifugao sacrificed a caribou (a rite that became the film's climax), they had a front-row seat.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both scions eventually entered the family business. Charlie, of course, became a film and television star, while Roman, who has a sonorous voice and a mug a lot like his dad's, embarked on an eclectic career behind the camera. He made commercials, music videos, short films and a feature, 2001's CQ, an affectionate send-up of sci-fi films such as Barbarella. He worked as a second unit director for his father (on Dracula, The Rainmaker and Tetro), his writer/director sister Sofia (on The Virgin Suicides, Lost in Translation and Marie Antoinette) and his writer/director friend Wes Anderson (on The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and The Darjeeling Limited). Together with Anderson, he wrote the scripts for The Darjeeling Limited and last year's Moonrise Kingdom; the latter is up for a best-original-screenplay Oscar next week. As well, he and Sofia currently run <span class="companylink">American Zoetrope</span>, the production company their father founded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, the younger Coppola and Sheen ran into each other occasionally, and Sheen always waxed enthusiastic about the idea of working together. “He's a huge Apocalypse Now fan. He's always quoting it,” says Coppola, who's now 47. “Even in the late 1980s, when he was a massive movie star and I was just this young guy trying to do whatever, he would say, ‘Your dad and mine made such a brilliant movie, we have to do something together.' That meant a lot to me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years ago, Coppola experienced a bad breakup, and found himself trapped in an emotional Mobius strip. “I kept having these conversations, ‘Do I love her or hate her? Do I want her back? No, she was the worst. What do you mean, she was perfect,'” he remembers. “The same memory could be beautiful or painful.” Naturally, given his DNA, he decided to explore his pain via film.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He wanted the movie to begin with a breakup, and he wanted to present his hero, who's “very outgoing, balls-out, crazy, immature,” in a kaleidoscopic way, through his varying memories of the relationship. And since he loves films that have “a verve and a pizzazz and a sense of play,” he wanted to create a world in which anything he could dream up could potentially fit – “I could put in a western sequence and a Nazi attack, and have it all make sense and be germane,” he says. He called the resulting script A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III, and he wanted Sheen to play the lead. (It opened in selected cities Friday.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sheen's reputation for being a hard-partying bad boy wasn't an issue for his old friend. “Not at all; I know what he can do,” Coppola says. “But it took a while to pin him down. He had to learn how to dance, speak Spanish, sing in Portuguese and expose himself in a deep way in some of the more emotional scenes. That can be scary. But I kept nudging him, and finally, I feel, it was the right time in his life for him to dig into this character. Once he decided, he couldn't have been more committed and dedicated. People consider Charlie to be flaky, but he's really quite the opposite.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coppola surrounded Sheen with members of his unofficial repertoire company, including his cousin, the writer and actor Jason Schwartzman, and his frequent collaborator Bill Murray, who does an amusing John Wayne impersonation in the western sequence. “My upbringing, the emphasis on family is a big one, and that includes the family that you work with,” Coppola says. “To have the pleasure of the continuity, loyalty, friendship that extend over years is a wonderful thing. It's fun, that's for sure. To see Bill show up in that red shirt, and Jason in a sheriff outfit with a Star of David, and our absurd, sexy Indians, to be shooting in the canyon where they used to shoot westerns and serials and Star Trek, with the Hollywood sign just off to the left, it was thrilling.” He also continued a family tradition: Coppola appeared in some of his dad's films – including The Godfather: Part 2, when he was 8 – and his baby daughter appears in Charles Swan III.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His father's success never intimidated him, Coppola maintains – “That sounds like b.s., but it's true.” Instead, it inspired him to be choosy, to turn down paycheque jobs (including directing I Still Know What You Did Last Summer) and to pursue only things that interested him. In high school, he was in a band and considered becoming an architect. He did the cinema-studies program at <span class="companylink">New York University</span>, took art classes and got into 3-D design. “I do a lot of commercials and videos, which allow me to try out all kinds of new things,” he says. “But when it comes to films, I've been rather precious, because I aspire to make movies in which you can feel a personality. I don't want to make a movie that some other person could make just as well as I, and it would be the same. You see a lot of movies like that, that don't have the stamp of individuality. I'm interested in the ones that do.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His stamp includes “things that have a sense of delight, that are colourful and pertain to the imagination. I like journeys, movies that take you into a world.” His films are indie in scale – Charles Swan III was shot in a mere 25 days – but not necessarily in spirit: “They're not moody and dark and gritty, as a lot of indie movies in recent times are,” Coppola says. “I'm not a very angst-filled person. My style is more about playfulness and the joy of putting on a show. I hope there's an appetite for a little sparkle and fun, even when a film comes from a soulful place – using a painful experience to graduate through it with some understanding, to be able to embark on the next experience with a bit of insight into yourself.” He believes that movies have a magic, and he should know – he's lived inside them.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Allison Chin and Michael Brune were arrested outside the White House last week, the event was noted with gravity in <span class="companylink">Sierra Club</span> boardrooms from British Columbia to Nova Scotia.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Chin, president of the Sierra Club, and Mr. Brune, the organization's executive director, were participating in a protest against the Keystone XL pipeline, and they went to Washington knowing they would be arrested along with Robert Kennedy Jr., president of Waterkeeper Alliance, and actress Daryl Hannah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arrest of the <span class="companylink">Sierra Club</span>'s top U.S. leaders marked the first time in its 120-year history that it had condoned civil disobedience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it has triggered soul searching north of the border, where <span class="companylink">Sierra Club</span> Canada directors are asking if it is time they too cast off the policy restriction against civil disobedience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The President is about to embark on a cross-country tour and he intends to talk with club leaders from Halifax to Victoria,” John Bennett, executive director, <span class="companylink">Sierra Club</span> Canada said on the weekend. “We've already conducted a survey of our supporters … and they were overwhelmingly in support [of civil disobedience].”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The poll results notwithstanding, the issue is raising fears among some that the conservative environmental group might lose core supporters if it becomes radicalized. But others are saying it would be shameful if the <span class="companylink">Sierra Club</span> wasn't willing to go to the wall to fight climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We recognize that civil disobedience is not something that everyone can endorse … But we believe the future of our planet demands no less,” Ms. Chin recently wrote. “We are watching a global crisis unfold before our eyes. To stand aside and let it happen – even though we know how to stop it – would be unconscionable.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Sierra Club</span> Canada was formed 50 years ago, but remains a separate entity from the U.S. arm. There are five regional chapters of the club within Canada – and they are all trying to come to grips with the question of whether they should break the law to further their environmental goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Sierra Club</span> BC recently posted a statement on its website, assuring the public it “does not engage in civil disobedience as a matter of policy.” But the Sierra Club Prairie Chapter seemed to be leaning the other way, stating that while it “does not participate directly in civil disobedience, we definitely applaud the use of both lawful protest and non-violent civil disobedience in the best traditions of Gandhian non-violence.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the decades, <span class="companylink">Sierra Club</span> Canada has dealt with many environmental crises – from acid rain to clear-cut logging – without feeling its leaders had to be prepared to break the law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Bennett said climate change is different.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're a pretty traditional organization,” he said. “We gather up the science and run a campaign based on the science. We have grown to expect over the last 50 years in Canada and 100-plus in the United States, that when you compile significant scientific evidence, government reviews that evidence and then takes action. But when it comes to climate change … governments haven't acted, they haven't followed the science. … So something more needs to be done.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That something more could see the leaders of one of Canada's most respected environmental groups chaining themselves to a fence, or sitting down in a road to block a pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if it comes to that, government should prepare itself for a storm of protest, because if a quiet, professional group like <span class="companylink">Sierra Club</span> Canada can be driven to desperation, then the general public can't be far behind.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team picked by many to finally take the step so many past editions of the <span class="companylink">St. Louis Blues</span> failed to do – a serious run at the Stanley Cup after regular-season success – may have righted itself.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Blues went into Sunday night's game against the <span class="companylink">Vancouver Canucks</span> on a two-game win streak after losing five in a row, and their comeback started when the players finally realized they fell victim to something that often bedevils <span class="companylink">NHL</span> teams on the rise. After a 6-1 start this season, the Blues started taking their success for granted. They thought their offensive skill would be enough, and it wasn't long before opponents were the ones scoring at will – especially after goaltender Jaroslav Halak was lost to a groin injury and Brian Elliott, who pushed his way into a 1A role with Halak last season, went back to being the goalie who was previously bounced by the <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span> and <span class="companylink">Colorado Avalanche</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was time for head coach Ken Hitchcock, who turned things around last season by forcing the Blues to play hard at both ends of the ice, to light another fire under his charges. Hitchcock says he was not frightened by the team's recent slump, seeing it as a chance to push his players back to a hard-working style that isn't much fun but brings results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The opportunity is to build a team,” Hitchcock told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “We have a good skill level. We're like every other team that is a budget team, in that you'd always like to have more. But we have a decent team here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And what we're trying to do is get this to be a really good team. Not a team with the numbers and names on the back, but a real team. We are learning the lessons that all of these other teams have learned. Are you going to look for space or are you going to start fighting for space? If you're a team, you don't look for space.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a lesson not easily learned. The Blues showed promise when they started last week's three-game road trip by beating the <span class="companylink">Detroit Red Wings</span>, and then went into Calgary and whipped the Flames 5-2. But the bad habits returned in Calgary as the Blues loosened up defensively after taking a 2-0 lead and almost let the Flames take over in the last two periods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hitchcock kept his players on the bus when they arrived at the Calgary airport following the game last Friday. He let them know turning pucks over and taking bad penalties is not the way to success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What we need to do is hard, it's emotional, it's gut-wrenching at times,” the coach said. “But man, once you're there, it just seems like it's a lot easier than you thought it would be. But it's going to be difficult getting there.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hitchcock will know quickly if his team is ready to play hard in front of the net at both ends of the ice. After the Vancouver game, the Blues have back-to-back, home-and-road games Tuesday and Wednesday against the <span class="companylink">San Jose Sharks</span> and Avalanche, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Someone to keep an eye on in this stretch of games is rookie goaltender Jake Allen. With Elliott fighting the puck, the 22-year-old Fredericton native was given a start against Detroit, won, and then won again in Calgary, complete with an eye-popping save on Flames winger T.J. Brodie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allen earned his third consecutive start Sunday, with Halak, who says he is 100 per cent, serving as the backup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Halak is expected to start either Tuesday or Wednesday, and Hitchcock says his plan was to give Elliott the other. Allen's recent play may change that – but it will take more heroics to make Hitchcock break away from his long-term Halak/Elliott tandem.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharks at Blues</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Blues show signs of regaining their reputation as a tough team to play against, and will need it against the Sharks, even though they are on a skid. Tuesday, 8 p.m., TSN2, NBCSN</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canucks at <span class="companylink">Blackhawks</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Games between these rivals have been fun to watch since the 2010 playoffs, when Chicago knocked off Vancouver in a bitter series on the way to the Stanley Cup. Tuesday, 8:30 p.m., Sportsnet Pacific</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blues at Avalanche</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Blues need to win both ends of a back-to-back, home-and-road set to prove to the faithful they are back on track. Wednesday, 10 p.m., TSN2, NBCSN</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruins at Lightning</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boston is sitting a little ways down the Eastern Conference standing than they should be thanks to a quirk in the schedule. They were fifth before Sunday's game against the Jets but only because they had played just 12 games (they only had two losses). Thursday, 7:30 p.m., <span class="companylink">NHL</span> Network U.S., NESN, SUN</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharks at Chicago</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the <span class="companylink">Blackhawks</span> beat the Sharks on Feb. 15, it was their second win against them in 10 days and kept the Sharks on a slide that started just before the first loss. That game also featured a fight between team captains Jonathan Toews of Chicago and Joe Thornton of San Jose, which shows just how much these teams like each other. Friday, 8:30 p.m., <span class="companylink">NHL</span> Network U.S., CSN California, CSN Chicago</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PROTECTION QUESTION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A remark by a teammate of <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span> defenceman Erik Karlsson after Karlsson was lost for the season due to a partially-severed Achilles tendon spoke loudly about the attitudes of <span class="companylink">NHL</span> players to what is best for them even in the face of compelling evidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Kevlar sock would probably have saved Karlsson from serious injury, but don't look for a rush to wear them among his peers. Even if wearing such socks are not a major adjustment, players still resist them for puzzling reasons, as Senators forward Stéphane Da Costa told the Ottawa Sun after trying a pair in practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sens watched their best player helped off the ice in agony but comfort and familiarity are still king.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have a routine, so I'm not sure,” Da Costa said of the chances of wearing the socks in a game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JETS HIT THE ROAD IN SEARCH OF ANSWERS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A five-game, nine-day road trip arrived just in time for the <span class="companylink">Winnipeg Jets</span>, who went into Sunday's game against the <span class="companylink">Boston Bruins</span> at the <span class="companylink">MTS Centre</span> with a 3-4 home record – which threatened to cast a shadow on their 17-month honeymoon with their fans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mind you, the Jets' 2-3-1 road record is even worse, but with the losses mounting it was a good time for the eastern swing that begins Tuesday in Buffalo and ends Feb. 26 in New York against the Rangers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it does not promise to be a fun trip as the Jets are now without their points leader and best defenceman, Tobias Enstrom, who suffered a shoulder injury in last Friday's loss to the <span class="companylink">Pittsburgh Penguins</span>. The Jets have not said how long Enstrom will be out but it appears he could be lost for at least a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Jets did get defenceman Zach Bogosian, who had off-season wrist surgery, back in the lineup at the same time as Enstrom was lost. Like Enstrom, Bogosian plays an offensive game but, at 22, lacks Enstrom's experience and leadership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Jets have not been much better than they were as Atlanta Thrashers until moving north in the summer of 2011, playing in front of packed houses allowed them to lead a charmed life at the <span class="companylink">MTS Centre</span>. But that is evaporating as the list of underachievers – Olli Jokinen (no stranger to such lists), Nik Antropov, Alexander Burmistrov and Kyle Wellwood – is growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the fact the Jets play in one of the noisiest arenas in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>, they do not use that to their advantage. Visiting teams are now prepared and the Jets invariably find themselves behind in the first period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Special teams are also a big problem. The power play, which was ranked second at home last season, with a 22-per-cent success rate, is now 12th overall (18.8 per cent). But the big problem is penalty killing: The Jets are dead last in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> in that department with an embarrassing 67.4-per-cent success rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the reasons for the poor showing is goaltender Ondrej Pavelec, who was one of the Jets' better players last season. Currently, he has a 3.15 goals-against average and .890 save percentage and is not showing any consistency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Jets do have one small comfort: forward Antti Miettinen is back on the ice for the first time since he was hurt in training camp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then again, his injury says much about the Jets season so far. Miettinen was hurt when he tripped on some sticks and fell into the boards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*****</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TORTORELLA NEEDS SHAKE AFTER LATEST SNAP</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Tortorella is in need of a dressing down from the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> head office. It is one thing for the famously fractious <span class="companylink">New York Rangers</span> head coach to spar with the reporters he despises, but quite another for him to refuse to recognize the basic function of journalists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Sunday's game against the <span class="companylink">Washington Capitals</span>, ESPN.com reporter Katie Strang asked Tortorella about the status of forward Rick Nash, who was thought to be nursing an injury. “None of your business,” Tortorella snapped. Later, the coach said Nash, who did play, was “banged up,” but he again refused to discuss injuries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even for a league that encourages deception when it comes to injuries, this is too much. Reporting on the health of a star player to readers, viewers and listeners is one of the most basic functions of a journalist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There will likely be a discussion between the Professional Hockey Writers Association and the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> about this, and the sooner Tortorella – who likes to become one of the hated media between jobs – is straightened, out the better.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than a century ago, Alfred Nobel began a tradition of recognizing excellence when he left much of his wealth to those who, with each passing year, “shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind.” Today, the Nobel Prize is a force for good in the world, celebrating and encouraging achievement with awards in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, economic sciences, peace and literature. Many Canadians are on the long list of recipients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The emergence of a world-class community of researchers and creative minds in Canada is undoubtedly one of our country's greatest achievements of the past 50 years. But is our learning receiving the international recognition it deserves – not solely in terms of Nobel Prizes, but with the many prestigious global honours and awards given to researchers each year? Are we adequately celebrating the work of the leading scholars and scientists at work in Canada today? Is their success being shared with and noted by the world?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this our record is mixed. As the Science, Technology and Innovation Council (STIC) has pointed out, Canadians are in fact winners of a disproportionately large share of global awards – approximately one in five international prizes goes to a researcher from Canada. Canadians do particularly well in the fields of environment, medicine and technology. These are important successes, not to be undervalued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the STIC also noted that when it comes to the world's most distinguished awards – the Nobel Prize, the Wolf Prize and the Fields Medal, for example – our country is underperforming. In the period from 1941 to 2008, Canadians received 19 of the top international awards in science – an impressive achievement, to be sure, but lacking when compared with the United States (with 1,403 winners), the United Kingdom (222), France (91), Germany (75) and Australia (42).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gap between Canada and other countries is significant because, in a world where knowledge is a key resource, awards are an important indicator of success, both for individual researchers and for the institutions that support them. In a globally competitive environment, such indicators are critical because when it comes to research, nothing attracts talent and resources like success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has implications for us all. In today's world, well-being is increasingly being defined by our ability to deepen our understanding of the natural and social world. In other words, knowledge is an increasingly valuable currency and essential to meeting the complex, interrelated challenges of the 21st century. Celebrating and nurturing our learning through awards and prizes is important to success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With this in mind, Canadian research agencies, scholarly associations and other organizations are taking action to enhance the global visibility of Canada's contributions to learning. This concerted effort is being supported by the STIC, as well as by Canada's three granting agencies – the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, the <span class="companylink">Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council</span> and the <span class="companylink">Canadian Institutes of Health Research</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working together, the aim is to nominate more of our leading scholars and scientists for major awards and prizes, while renewing our approach to sharing and celebrating their findings. We are reaching out to the wider academic and research community to identify opportunities for recognition and to develop compelling and strategic nominations. Our hope is to double the number of Canadian winners of international research awards by 2017. Would that not be a wonderful way to celebrate Canada's 150th birthday?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is so important that we recognize excellence, because our researchers and scholars are tackling problems and developing knowledge in science and engineering, in health and medicine and in the social sciences and humanities – in short, they are seeking answers to some of the most pressing questions of our time. Their success is our success, and that is a fact worth celebrating.</p>

If it did, it would take a long time. Talk of rapid proliferation across the region is simply not apt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the dawn of the nuclear era, various leaders and analysts have predicted that nuclear proliferation would take place rapidly and inexorably. Those countries that could build the bomb would do so, and others would build it in response. It has been predicted that almost 50 countries would eventually join the nuclear club alongside the five nuclear-weapon states recognized under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That prediction has proved wrong. Only four additional countries – India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea – have acquired nuclear weapons. One country unambiguously tried and was stopped (Iraq, before it was foolish enough to invade Kuwait). In each case, the reasons why these countries decided to build nuclear weapons had to do with the specifics of their security situations rather than a reflex action. This record is hardly cause for celebration but also hardly the proliferation threat so often forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, neighbours were threatened when these countries acquired nuclear weapons but decided not to build nuclear weapons in response. Japan and South Korea did not build them after China and then North Korea did, despite chilling rhetoric from the one-party states that easily matched anything Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said about Israel. No Arab country built them after Israel did. Yes, Pakistan followed India into the nuclear club, but no other country in the region has.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than build their own bombs, most countries faced with neighbours acquiring nuclear weapons have sought alliances and protection from others – most often the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, contrary to popular wisdom, experience has been that most states do not build nuclear bombs, even when they have the opportunity and, seemingly, the motive to do so. If there is a norm of international conduct regarding nuclear weapons, it is a norm of non-proliferation. For every state that has developed nuclear weapons, there are dozens more, including Canada, that could have but did not. South Africa did but then gave them up. There are several, including Brazil, Argentina and Sweden, that went down the road toward nuclear weapons but stopped and went back. There are even a few – Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan – that inherited nuclear weapons when the Soviet Union collapsed but soon gave them up voluntarily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet, in the Iranian case, we continue to be captivated by an argument that widespread regional proliferation is inevitable. Why? In part, it is because of what some scholars of proliferation call a “proliferation narrative” that has gripped the majority of analysts and practitioners of international affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This narrative, which focuses on power as the key element of international affairs, holds that nuclear weapons are the ultimate expression of power; that states seek to maximize their power; and so states, all other things being equal, will want nuclear weapons. Moreover, states facing a nuclear-armed foe will almost certainly want their own bomb. Despite decades of evidence to the contrary, this narrative continues to hold sway in large parts of the academic and practitioner communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason may be that pointing to an inevitable proliferation cascade is ample justification for those who wish to attack Iran to do so. It is a powerful narrative: “Yes, an attack on Iran may be dangerous, uncertain and could lead to a regional war, but far better to try to stop the Iranians from getting the bomb before X number of other [whisper when you say this] Muslim countries across the Middle East decide to build bombs as well.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But would they? And could they do it quickly? Despite some musings by some members of the Saudi Royal Family, it is debatable as to whether any other Middle East country would automatically decide to build a bomb if Iran ever did. Moreover, even if other states in the region did decide to build bombs, it would take decades. Experience seems to show that most of them would eventually counter an Iranian bomb by moving even further into the security embrace of the United States – an outcome profoundly at odds with Iran's interests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea of a rapid and inevitable proliferation cascade across the Middle East is simply not reasonable – but it works well as a scare tactic to justify a war with Iran that might otherwise be a hard sell to a war-weary American public.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we have here is an old-fashioned fight for a starting job, and despite no pitches having yet been thrown in anger, already the <span class="companylink">Toronto Blue Jays</span>' brain trust is going back and forth between Maicer Izturis and Emilio Bonifacio as the second baseman.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Izturis was technically the first major-league free agent to sign this off-season, agreeing on Nov. 8 to a three-year contract for $9-million (all currency U.S.) with a club option for a fourth year at $3-million. Yet he is the forgotten newcomer compared to Bonifacio, who joined the <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span> in their massive 12-player trade with the <span class="companylink">Miami Marlins</span> that was finalized 11 days after Izturis's contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is fine with Izturis, because in eight years with mostly very good <span class="companylink">Los Angeles Angels</span> teams, the diminutive Venezuelan played 759 games and had 2,792 plate appearances, splitting his time between third base (290 games), second base (246 games, including 49 as recently as 2011) and shortstop (194 games).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Izturis and Bonifacio are switch hitters. Bonifacio is five years younger than the 32-year-old Izturis and has stolen 70 bases in 84 attempts the past two seasons. But Bonifacio has also struck out 367 times in 476 games, compared to Izturis's 313 strikeouts in 791 games, and for a team that lived through Kelly Johnson's 159 whiffs in 2012, don't think that isn't a concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plus, as manager John Gibbons noted Sunday: “Maicer played for Mike Scioscia.” Translation: Izturis is a professional, he plays the game the right way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People said and wondered the same thing when I was in Anaheim for eight years,” Izturis said Sunday, before the <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span>' first official workout of spring training. “That team always had a lot of players and talent, but I'd still get 300, maybe 400 at-bats. One year, 500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I like this team,” Izturis added. “I will help this team wherever I can. This team, to me, is a lot like the 2005 Angels with Garret Anderson. Vlady [Vladimir Guerrero], a mix of so many good young and older players.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Izturis agreed to terms with the <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span> in November on the eve of general managers meetings in Indian Wells, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I told my agent, ‘Find me a team that will play me at one position,'” Izturis said, shrugging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span> said after acquiring Bonifacio they viewed him as more of a utility player. Then, Gibbons suggested he could be the starter at second. In his state-of-the-team address last Saturday, Jose Bautista mused having Bonifacio batting ninth, or second behind Jose Reyes, would be “like having two leadoff hitters.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Lately, I've heard better things about Bonifacio,” Gibbons said. “But let's see how it plays out. Izturis probably has the edge, but we'll put the best guy out there.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Reyes and third baseman Brett Lawrie both competing in the World Baseball Classic, Izturis will get plenty of chances to show his versatility, or perhaps “flexibility,” the word chosen by fangraphs.com in an analysis of Izturis's defence. The website's analysis showed that after 1,500 innings as a shortstop, almost 2,000 innings as a second baseman and more than 2,000 innings as a third baseman, his UZR (a rating that attaches run value to defence) is different degrees of quite adequate at all three spots. That explains in part how Izturis carved out his niche with an American League team, where the designated hitter presents hurdles to a bench player's ability to get at-bats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marlins people are split on whether Bonifacio plays defence well enough to be at second base everyday. Some see him better suited as a superutility player because of his ability to handle the outfield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a platoon possibility: Bonifacio's career numbers are better as a right-handed batter, where he hits .290; Izturis's numbers are better as a left-handed hitter, particularly after last season's .231 slide as a righty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General manager Alex Anthopoulos wondered Sunday whether Izturis could have the type of late career being enjoyed by Marco Scutaro, but for now it's enough Izturis is in the middle of the position battle of the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As if it could be any other way.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Supreme Court hearing would be preferable to the NAFTA arbitration proceeding against the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span> that Lilly has initiated (arising from a dispute about an ADHD drug, but raising a similar issue); it would keep the whole matter inside a quite specific point of Canadian patent law, and could avoid an unwieldy, sprawling comparison of the impacts of the various aspects of U.S. and Canadian patent law upon pharmaceutical corporations.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generic drug companies sometimes challenge the usefulness of a patented drug – paradoxically, because they want to sell the useful drug themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This whole controversy arose from a natural eagerness to facilitate and expedite the treatment of patients who have HIV/AIDS with a drug called AZT, which had not yet been tested in human beings or animals. In 2002, the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span> may have stretched a point by helping get AZT to market more quickly, relying on the “promises of the patent.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By an unintended consequence, such promises have somehow metamorphosed into a new requirement that is needed in order to prove a drug's usefulness in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lilly and other similar companies want patent protection before they are ready to publish their clinical trials on the Internet, when they have to disclose their work to competitors. They are not in the business of making and selling off-patent drugs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Supreme Court ought to re-establish a sensible balance between prima-facie evidence of usefulness and all-but-proven promise. Even better, the federal government could introduce a bill to clarify the utility criterion in the Patent Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, firms such as Lilly do very well in Canada, because (among other things) medical patents last longer here than in the United States. Nonetheless, Canadian law should not subject companies to irresolvable paradoxes.</p>

Baseball's training camps get into full swing across Florida and Arizona this week, and the blank-slate possibilities of a new season allow snowbound fans to share the buoyant spirit radiating from the diamonds where the boys of summer are now congregating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fresh start of February exudes sunny optimism: Hitters declare they're in the best shape ever, surgically repaired pitchers say their new elbow feels just fine, managers insist that last year's bottom-feeding team has a good chance to be a contender this year.</p>

Reality will get in the way soon enough – failure is built into a sport where even a great hitter fails to get on base six times out of 10. But for now, the good-news proclamations on the field of dreams play to a willing crowd, and even seasoned observers of the game feel the urge to believe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Baseball's most thoughtful believers are flocking to one team in particular: the <span class="companylink">Toronto Blue Jays</span>, a thoroughly overhauled squad that strongly aspires to be Canada's Team, if the big red maple leaf on the players' spring-training caps is anything to go by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Jays and their young general manager, the Montreal-born Alex Anthopoulos, have become Internet darlings for their shrewd off-season wheeling and dealing, and have reawakened pride in an underperforming team that hasn't made it to the World Series since the glory years of 1992-93.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's fair to say that many of the new acquisitions come with question marks, if only because Mr. Anthopoulos's sense of economy requires him to take chances on players he believes to be undervalued because of age, injury history or poor reputation in matters on-field and off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the preseason sunshine, these doubts are silenced, and all that riskiness can be celebrated as daring. Spring is in the air, for baseball devotees at least, and it's much easier to agree with the oddsmakers that this team with a quirky 38-year-old knuckleballer who relishes Yann Martel's Life of Pi, a once-marginalized power-hitter coming off wrist surgery, and a new outfielder who came cheap because he tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs, has a good chance to go all the way.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The afternoon Presidents' Day match between the <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span> and the <span class="companylink">New Jersey Devils</span> had been a game of bobbled pucks, whiffed shots, goal posts, near misses and give-your-head-a-shake plays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senators had gone a stunning 137 minutes 17 seconds without scoring a goal, their offence fizzled to a damp, cold wick since Matt Cooke's skate had sliced into the Achilles tendon of Erik Karlsson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That injury, suffered in Wednesday's loss to the <span class="companylink">Pittsburgh Penguins</span>, had seemingly exposed the Achilles heel of the entire Ottawa team: an inability to score without their young Norris Trophy-winning defenceman and their playmaking centre Jason Spezza, also lost for the season after undergoing back surgery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Spezza in the lineup, the Senators had averaged 3.3 goals a game and were doing just fine. Without Spezza, that fell to 2.1 goals a game, usually courtesy of Karlsson's inventive work. Without Karlsson, it hit 0.0 in a shutout loss to the <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span> Saturday night and seemed a good bet to remain there against the <span class="companylink">New Jersey Devils</span> on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Devils, after all, had scored on their first chance of the game, Stephen Gionta burying a rebound only 1:19 in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But hell finally froze over 8:12 into the third period when 40-year-old Daniel Alfredsson – who had muffed a similar chance earlier – put a backhand shot behind 40-year-old Martin Brodeur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, the game went to shootout when neither team could find a second goal in regular time or overtime. Alfredsson hit yet another post, but Ottawa's Swedish rookie, Jakob Silfverberg, got a shot past Brodeur, giving Ottawa a welcome 2-1 victory in this annus horribilis of an injury-plagued season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the win comes two points, maintaining the team's slim hold on a possible playoff spot, at the same time complicating the debate that is consuming those Ottawa voices not screaming with outrage over the expenses of certain senators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With eight players injured – some $22.6-million (U.S.) in salaries tied up in bandages – Ottawa general manager Bryan Murray has had his own thoughts to entertain, not to mention the opinions of every person, some of them sober, able to push the buttons that will get them onto the sports talk shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Murray has one marvellous card to play, though it is uncertain if, or how, he might play that card.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all Ottawa's troubles on the ice, they are blessed in the crease. Starter Craig Anderson, NHL player of the month in January, is arguably the best goaltender in the NHL now. The best goalie in the AHL, without argument, is young Robin Lehner of the Binghamton Senators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, head coach Paul MacLean – with a home game scheduled for Tuesday against the <span class="companylink">New York Islanders</span> – elected to play back-up Ben Bishop instead of Anderson. Bishop was often spectacular in winning his first game of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anderson is 31, Bishop 26, Lehner 21. Murray could, theoretically, find a buyer for Bishop and might be able to get in return an offensive top-six forward to sort-of replace Spezza, or a playmaking defenceman to sort-of replace Karlsson. There would, however, be no total replacement and, perhaps, what would be the point?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Murray could easily find a Stanley Cup contender eager to take on Anderson in return for prospects or future draft choices, which would be attractive. But Anderson has two years left on his contract and, just maybe, he's exactly who the Sens would want back there once Karlsson and Spezza return .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though it is not in the nature of Murray or MacLean to do so, there has also been free advice offered that the team might embrace its scoring spiral – “When you're cold, you're cold,” centre Zack Smith conceded in a between-period interview – and trust in the lottery giving them a pick of major potential in what is going to be a good draft year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Senators were going to shrug and let it all slip away, then other choices might come into play, including the Ottawa sacrilege of dispatching Alfredsson off to see if he might lift the Stanley Cup before he raises the issue of retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hockey has a long history of such arrangements and no one doubts Alfredsson's long-term future lies in Ottawa, where he expects to remain with his family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He was very good,” MacLean said of his captain after the win in New Jersey. He was more than good. And if the Sens are going to shake free of their stunningly bad power play – 0-for-25 since Karlsson went down – it will be with Alfredsson doing the marshalling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Murray's easiest choice is merely to stay the course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, when the Sens slipped into the playoffs, it was a surprise. The rebuilding plan was intended to take three years, at least. Next year will be Year 3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And with a healthy Karlsson and Spezza back, this shrunken season would be quickly, and appropriately, forgotten.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the items on Alex Anthopoulos's to-do list on this breezy, coolish Monday morning was catching a glimpse of Colby Rasmus's reworked, quieter swing during an eye-popping session of batting practice, and seeking out reliever Casey Janssen for a chat.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anthopoulos's message to Janssen was going to be simple: don't push yourself; watch your bullpen sessions; there's plenty of time to get ready for April; and if you need a day here or there during spring training, well, don't be afraid to take it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is it Mariano Rivera says, Anthopoulos asked? That he needs four innings in the Grapefruit League to be good to go during the regular season? That's all?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that Anthopoulos was comparing Janssen to Rivera. But the <span class="companylink">Toronto Blue Jays</span>' general manager was making it clear that Janssen will be treated this spring like a rehabilitating incumbent closer, and if nothing else it was a subtle reminder that for all the balloons and streamers surrounding the first few days of spring training, the <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span> are monitoring the status of some key contributors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Starting pitcher Ricky Romero revealed that he had had a blood-platelet procedure for tendinitis in his knees, and manager John Gibbons suggested off the cuff that knee pain might be an issue for Romero.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anthopoulos is extending Janssen a courtesy that he cannot extend to the man who was supposed to be the <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span>' closer, Sergio Santos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Janssen became the closer by default last season when Francisco Cordero crumbled after early-season shoulder issues shut down Santos, eventually necessitating surgery. Janssen filled the void masterfully, converting 22 of 25 save opportunities, including 15 consecutively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Janssen, too, needed surgery to alleviate discomfort in the acromioclavicular joint of his right shoulder and he is now behind Santos in terms of availability out of the gate. Janssen won't appear in Grapefruit League games until the second week of March. Santos is throwing free and easy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span> acquired Santos at the winter meetings in 2011, then kept him away from prying eyes during spring training by sending him to minor-league camp to work on a changeup. That raised suspicions that some saw as being justified when he finally was shut down for the season, but Santos said Monday that he really was working on a changeup, a pitch he'd thrown at times with the <span class="companylink">Chicago White Sox</span>, but that catcher A.J. Pierzynski seemed reluctant to call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“No, no, no, I really was working on a changeup,” Santos said. “I didn't foresee anything breaking down. There was some discomfort, but I thought I could get through it. After that game in Kansas City [April 20], though, it was pretty clear that wasn't going to be the case. It would have been too hard to fight through it for another four months, so I tried rehabilitating it, and then we all made a decision to just have a kind of general clean-out.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given a do-over, Santos said he probably wouldn't have tried to pitch through spring training, and if anything it only reinforced in both his and the <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span>' minds that even at 29 he is still a work in progress. A converted shortstop who is in his second stint with the <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span>, the White Sox turned Santos into a reliever in 2009, and after just 282/3 minor-league innings, he was pitching in the majors in 2010, saving 30 games in 2011 with 13.1 strikeouts per nine innings pitched.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has survived on power stuff (fastball and slider), but he wants to refine a changeup that had switch hitters Jose Reyes, Emilio Bonifacio and Maicer Izturis nodding their heads in admiration during Santos's first bullpen session on Sunday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I get some movement on it,” Santos said. “It can get me some ground-ball outs against lefties.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consistency of command is, of course, a necessary caveat. But if Santos stays healthy, and forkball-tossing Steve Delabar (12.55 strikeouts per nine innings pitched with the <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span> and <span class="companylink">Seattle Mariners</span> in 2012, the most of any American League pitcher with a minimum 60 innings) can continue to write his rags-to-riches story, Gibbons won't have to wait until the ninth inning to get a strikeout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if Janssen, who lost the 2008 season to surgery on his right labrum, can't close, there are options, including Santos, a guy who was once the <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span>' preferred option.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advocates of clean, green electric cars suffered a double disappointment last week: first, a harshly unfavourable report in the New York Times, alleging the failure of a vaunted Tesla S electric sedan to complete a weekend test drive without drama, culminating with a dead battery and a tow truck; and secondly, the intemperate reaction of Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, who denounced the report as “a fake” and claimed to expose it using trip data surreptitiously collected by the company during the test.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dispute has become a critical test of credibility for a bold new industry for which Tesla, equipped with a $465-million government loan, is the popular champion. Despite the promise of 500 kilometres of driving on a single charge in a $90,000 Tesla S, real-world tests suggest “range anxiety” remains an unavoidable drawback to life with even the most advanced electric cars.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disputed test was meant to showcase a new network of charging stations on the I-95 highway between Washington and Boston. Tesla backers say it is still too new to function satisfactorily; skeptics say it never will. The obvious question that neither side addresses is why anyone would want to drive that distance in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Europe and increasingly in Asia, such intercity travel is very much the business of high-speed electric rail, not cars or even planes. Rail's success contrasts sharply with unimpressive experiments with all-purpose electric cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, Madrid-Barcelona was the busiest air route in the world, with 971 flights a week. Shortly after construction of a rail link between the two cities, more than half those flights disappeared, and discounters began selling seats for as little as $10. Most travellers now choose rail, at about $200 for a one-way ticket. A trip that once took drivers six hours can now be accomplished in two and a half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Eurostar rail link between Paris and London and the TGV connection between Paris and Lyon have wrought similar revolutions. Meanwhile car use is declining throughout the developed world, even in countries where there is no modern rail. Experts dispute the causes, citing everything from a reaction against urban sprawl to a new generation's “love affair with the phone,” not the car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The paradigm shift that electric-car enthusiasts have long heralded seems to be actually happening – but it runs on steel, not rubber.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is wrong to be apparently acquiescing in a patchwork regulation of the wireless industry, in which federal and provincial regimes overlap and confuse all concerned. Jean-Pierre Blais, the Chair, seems blithely content with continued balkanization, even disdainful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, the CRTC has held hearings about a proposed wireless code for consumers. Last year, <span class="companylink">Telus Corp</span>. advocated national standards for service in wireless contracts; the CRTC's draft code is the result. What prompted the movement toward national standards was the proliferation of provincial legislation to protect consumers. The commission had previously believed there was enough competition, so that consumers didn't need help.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week at the hearing, Mr. Blais appeared dismissive about truly national standards. He asked Kenneth Engelhart, the senior vice-president for regulatory affairs of <span class="companylink">Rogers Communications Inc</span>., “Why do you want us to do that dirty work…?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no doubt that the federal Parliament – not the provincial legislatures – holds the authority to pass legislation about broadcasting and electronic communications, and to set up subsidiary bodies to regulate those activities, under the federal “peace, order and good government” power in the Constitution Act, 1867. It is true that commercial relationships come under the provinces' property-and-civil-rights power, but the federal power is paramount. If Ottawa had done nothing at all about telecommunications, that paramountcy would not apply. But the CRTC's very name shows that, to use constitutional-law dialect, Ottawa has indeed “occupied the field” – a field where Mr. Blais thinks “dirty work” is being proposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he put it to Mr. Engelhart, “You're turning to us to occupy, in a way to your benefit.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A pan-Canadian wireless code should not mean loose or minimal standards. It is in the interest of Canadian consumers and Canadian businesses to have wireless consistency across Canada. Surely, the CRTC is capable of forming strong regulations that are not skewed in favour of corporations, but which benefit consumers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim O'Neill gave the B.C. government what it was hoping for Monday – an endorsement by one of the country's top financial forecasters that its budget numbers are solid. The question now is whether validation from the <span class="companylink">Bank of Montreal</span>'s former chief economist will help embattled Premier Christy Clark persuade a skeptical public that the budget her government presents Tuesday can be believed.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, that was the whole point of this exercise. The Liberals knew that a promise to balance the books in what is a critical pre-election budget would be met with widespread cynicism. Few have forgotten how former Liberal premier Gordon Campbell had boasted in the budget tabled just before the 2009 election that his government had contained the deficit to $495-million – a fiscal miracle, we were led to believe, given the widespread damage caused by The Great Recession. A fiscal fairy tale as it turned out. The Liberals were off by more than $1.5-billion. It was the first of what turned out to be four consecutive deficits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Liberals know that if they have any hope of winning this election, they need to persuade voters that despite an uneven record managing the province's books, they are still better than the NDP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is why tabling a balanced budget became such a priority for Ms. Clark. And that is why getting a respected, outside opinion on their numbers was absolutely crucial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The conclusion reached is that economic and revenue expectations are generally well-founded,” Mr. O'Neill wrote in his report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economist made one fairly significant recommendation: that the natural-gas price used for the revenue forecast be lowered. Despite the $65-million hit that entailed, the government obliged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Otherwise, Mr. O'Neill was fairly praiseworthy about a budget preparation protocol that is, he said, rigorous and mostly cautious. And he's right. The people who work in B.C.'s finance ministry are some of the smartest people around. And government also relies on advice from several outside agencies such as the Economic Forecast Council of B.C. – a group of the province's top economists – in coming up with its numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mostly, the government has gotten into trouble when revenue projections from the resource sector have crumbled. The government would argue that its estimates from this sector always err on the side of caution. Others would say the government has repeatedly missed warning signs that should have prompted it to revise its revenue forecasts from the resource sector downward – especially around natural-gas prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's interesting that this is the one area that Mr. O'Neill zeroed in on. And was the one area in which the government had to retreat in terms of the numbers it was prepared to use. This is the same sector, it is noted, on which Ms. Clark is staking the economic future of the province. The sector that is supposed to fill the coffers of the proposed Prosperity Fund that would be used to pay off the province's accumulated debt by 2028.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as Mr. O'Neill rightly noted, natural-gas revenues have been overprojected in five of the past eight years. And the average size of those variances against other resource sectors is significant – $584-million versus $205-million for forests, for instance. “This is a key reason for my suggesting that the forecast for natural-gas revenues by shaded down further in the upcoming budget,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, Mr. O'Neill's report guarantees nothing. He did not look at the other side of the ledger: spending. Granted, this is something far easier for government to control. Mr. O'Neill also did not talk about the potential hit the treasury could take thanks to an ever-softening housing market and a stagnant retail sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor do we know what size the contingency fund will be in this budget. In the past, the government has socked away several hundred million to access in the event of unexpected emergencies or revenue declines. It's anticipated that the fund found in Tuesday's budget will be much more modest in nature. That could present problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. O'Neill gave the Liberals what they wanted, a much-needed stamp of approval. Then again, they wouldn't have allowed him to present a report that excoriated their budget plans. To have any credibility, the government was going to have to address virtually every recommendation its economist-for-hire made, no matter how costly. The Liberals got off the hook relatively easy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether it's enough to restore the Liberals' reputation as top-flight fiscal managers is doubtful, however. Over the past decade, they've gone roughly $6-billion over budget, according to the C.D. Howe Institute. They've run deficits when they said they wouldn't. In the process, they gave up that ace in the hole that was always available to use against the NDP come election time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One report doesn't give them that card back.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Brison believes the Maritime provinces are a decade away from calamity. He thinks he knows how to prevent it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are at the tipping point,” the Nova Scotia Liberal MP said Sunday in an interview. Debt is expanding even as fiscal capacity is shrinking. Maritime governments could soon find it increasingly difficult to raise money from lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My message is actually one of hope, because it's not too late,” said Mr. Brison. “But in a very short period of time it will be.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech Friday to the <span class="companylink">Atlantic Institute for Market Studies</span>, Mr. Brison laid out in stark detail just how close his home province has come to insolvency:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– Nova Scotia's debt has topped $12-billion. “If you combine our share of the federal debt with our provincial debt as a percentage of our GDP, our fiscal situation is about as dire as that of European economies like Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain just before they hit the tipping point,” Mr. Brison observed in his speech.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– So determined are young people to get out of the province that in the past five years alone the median age has increased from 42 to almost 44, and the population over 65 has increased from 15.1 per cent to 16.6 per cent. Three thousand fewer children start school every year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– Raising new revenue to eliminate the deficit and reduce debt is a limited option. Corporate income taxes are already the highest in the country; so are electricity rates. Nova Scotia ties with PEI for the highest sales-tax rate (15 per cent); income-tax rates are second only to Quebec's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These trends should scare the heck out of us,” Mr. Brison concluded in his speech.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They point to a near future that could look something like this: Fewer and older people are forced to pay ever higher taxes and energy rates to sustain fixed capital costs, driving out the few remaining industries. Impatient taxpayers in other provinces refuse to bridge the gap through increased equalization payments. Spooked lenders start charging interest rates so high that the province cannot borrow and Ottawa has to intervene, imposing grinding austerity on the region in order to get the books balanced and debt under control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This doesn't have to happen. Although Mr. Brison does not support the trio of Conservative senators who advocate Maritime political union, he does propose economic union, which he calls a New East Partnership and Trade Agreement Plus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That title may remind you of something. The New West Partnership of British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan will be fully implemented by July 1. Workers can move freely between provinces without requiring additional certification; all governments commit to treating out-of-province firms equally in procurement contracts; regulations are being made mutually compatible; and the three governments seek opportunities for joint procurement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar economic union in Atlantic Canada, Mr. Brison believes, would promote regional growth while reducing government costs. He also wants to see a regional strategy to encourage immigration, a regional securities regulator and an Atlantic Liquor Commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He would dream further. There is nothing in the existing New West Partnership to prevent any or all Atlantic provinces from joining it, he observes, though “obviously there would be a name change.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This writer wonders whether a future Ontario government couldn't also join, finally creating an English Canadian economic union. Quebec, as is almost always the case, would probably prefer to go its own way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Brison's prescriptions are not sufficient to reverse Maritime Canada's relentless decline, they at least point the provinces in the right direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While the decisions may seem difficult now,” he warned, “they will be much easier than the excruciatingly painful ones that will be imposed on us in 10 years.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The alternative is to go past the tipping point and see what happens. That route is easy. All politicians have to do is nothing.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forget about fat, sugar, even sodium. There's a new dietary evil we're told to cut from our diets: wheat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Dr. William Davis, author of best-selling Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight and Find Your Path Back to Health, the grain that's been a staple of the human diet for thousands of years is making us sick and fat.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his book, Davis makes the case that wheat is the “world's most destructive dietary ingredient.” Just how toxic is wheat? Davis, a U.S. cardiologist, asserts that our consumption of “genetically altered” modern wheat is the cause of rising obesity rates and a myriad of diseases, including celiac disease, diabetes, heart disease, even schizophrenia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The remedy? Follow the Wheat Belly diet, and your spare tire and your symptoms – digestive upset, rashes, joint pain, foggy thinking, to list just a few – will vanish. Too good to be true? Perhaps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wheat Belly is yet another diet book that blames one food, food group or food ingredient – be it fat, carbohydrates, sugar, or, in this case, wheat products – for a multifaceted problem: obesity. And it does so by putting forth one doctor's theories, notions that aren't strongly backed by scientific evidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem with today's wheat, according to Davis, is a protein called gluten. Years of traditional wheat breeding have created changes in the structure of gluten, alterations potentially harmful to human health. Yet, the data used to support this notion come from an experiment conducted in the laboratory, not conventional plant breeding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Dr. Brett Carver, wheat genetics chair in agriculture at <span class="companylink">Oklahoma State University</span>, none of the wheat grown in North America is developed through the process used in the cited lab experiment. What's more, experts say the gluten composition of wheat has not changed dramatically over the past 100 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be clear, nowhere in the world is wheat a product of genetic engineering, nor is Davis claiming it is. Genetically engineered crops may have foreign genes – from other plants or animals – inserted into their genetic codes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is there a connection between wheat and obesity? While the proliferation of wheat products parallels the rise in obesity, such an association does not prove cause and effect. (It is interesting to note that people in some European and Asian countries consume much higher per capita amounts of wheat flour than those in the United States, yet they have lower obesity rates.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It does suggest, however, that one culprit behind our expanding waistlines is our penchant for highly processed wheat products. It's true that a steady intake of refined grains can lead to increased levels of insulin, which can drive appetite and fat storage. But is this the real reason obesity is on the rise?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We must also consider the so-called “obesogenic” environment in which we live, one that encourages us to eat and drink more calories than we expend. We rely on cars to take us everywhere. Highly processed and fast foods are easily accessible. Hectic lifestyles force many of us to eat on the go, rather than sitting down to a home-cooked meal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no proof eating wheat is a direct cause of obesity, nor is there strong evidence to show the grain causes the numerous diseases that Davis links it to. Yes, eating wheat can trigger celiac disease in genetically predisposed people. And yes, the prevalence of celiac disease is on the rise; according to <span class="companylink">Mayo Clinic</span> researchers, four times as many people have the disease now than did in 1950s. But researchers aren't certain why.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Celiac disease is an inherited disorder that causes the body's immune system to attack the small intestine when gluten – found in wheat, rye and barley – is consumed. Symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss and, in children, delayed growth. But many symptoms of celiac, such as bloating, skin rashes, joint pain, anemia and infertility, are more subtle or don't involve the gut. As a result, the disease can go unrecognized for years before a diagnosis is made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what does the Wheat Belly diet look like? In my opinion, it's a dressed-up version of a low-carb diet. Besides no wheat, other off-limits foods include potatoes, processed gluten-free foods (such as breads and crackers), juices, dried fruit, soy products and energy bars. You can eat gluten-free grains such as rice, buckwheat, millet and quinoa, but serving sizes must be less than 1/2 cup. Milk, yogurt and cottage cheese must be limited. Because of its sugar content, fruit is also limited to very small serving sizes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can eat vegetables, eggs, nuts, seeds, unprocessed meats, cheese, oils, olives, avocados and pickled vegetables.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Yoni Freedhoff, an Ottawa-based obesity expert regards the diet as “just Atkins minus cured meats … it's highly restrictive and extremely unlikely to be sustainable in the long run.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shelley Case, a dietitian and member of the professional advisory board of the Canadian Celiac Association, advises anyone with symptoms suggestive of celiac disease to get tested. And until you do, you must avoid all gluten-free diets, including the Wheat Belly diet, because in order to be accurately diagnosed, you must be eating a gluten-containing diet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Because one in 100 people have celiac disease, yet only 5 to 10 per cent are diagnosed, get tested before jumping on the gluten-free bandwagon,” Case says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once diagnosed, individuals with celiac disease must strictly adhere to a gluten-free diet. As for the rest of us? Dropping wheat can help some people feel better, in particular those with a wheat sensitivity. But if you're following the Wheat Belly diet to lose weight, first ask yourself if you can envision eating this way long-term.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are touchy times on the bilateral front. Canada is looking to diversify its foreign markets. The thorny issue of the Keystone XL pipeline is on the table. With his re-election victory, President Barack Obama is emboldened, pushing his liberal agenda, one that clashes with the governing philosophy in Ottawa. Last week, Washington got meddlesome, playing the linkage card, suggesting that co-operation on energy issues might be tied to better performance by the Harper Conservatives on the environment.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now there is talk of Washington sending an iconic liberal, a Kennedy, to Ottawa as the next U.S. ambassador. Caroline Kennedy, the rumour mill has it, is being considered for the post. What a splash that would make. Camelot on the Rideau. The American media would start paying attention to us. Ottawa's reputation as one of the world's most boring capitals would be refurbished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good grief. Throw in the likely selection of Justin Trudeau as Liberal Party leader and, with the daughter of John F. Kennedy as ambassador, it would be like the sixties all over again. Liberal legends at large.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But how would Stephen Harper's Conservatives view a Kennedy appointment? One can bet they'd hardly be overjoyed. It would be seen as provocative. It would tend to widen the ideological gulf and put an added strain on relations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not only the iconic liberal name that would grate on the Tories. There's some history to be recalled here. And from a Conservative perspective, what an ugly stretch of history it is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President John F. Kennedy was Tory enemy No. 1. The Kennedy relationship with John Diefenbaker was the worst in the history of the presidents and prime ministers. The Kennedy administration precipitated Dief's downfall on a no-confidence vote in 1963. In the election campaign, the Cameloters worked against the Tories, giving Lester Pearson every lift they could.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two governments clashed over a myriad of defence co-operation issues, including the Cuban missile crisis. The differences came to head when the White House issued a press release that categorically contradicted Diefenbaker on the question of nuclear weapons for NATO allies. It led to the no-confidence motion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone doubting the seriousness of the American role only had to read a memorandum written some years later by McGeorge Bundy, who served as Kennedy's national security adviser. “I might add,” Bundy wrote to Lyndon Johnson, “that I myself have been sensitive to the need for being extra polite to Canadians ever since George Ball and I knocked over the Diefenbaker government by one incautious press release.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kennedy gang loved Pearson and had him as a guest at the White House. One day, Diefenbaker glared at Pearson across the Commons aisle. “When,” he demanded, “are you going back for further instructions?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for ambassadors, Kennedy's man in Ottawa, a pushy American named Walton Butterworth, was hated by Dief. He referred to him as “Butterballs.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the Obama White House, the Kennedy crew were more hip and progressive compared to their Canadian counterparts. The Kennedyites couldn't believe the naïveté of Dief's foreign minister, Howard Green. Dean Rusk, Kennedy's secretary of state, once told me of how the story made the White House rounds of a visit to Ottawa by Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba. The African leader had the reputation of a notorious fornicator. In a meeting with Green, he asked that a girl be sent over to his Chateau Laurier suite. The churchgoing Green thought he meant a typist. When the unsuspecting stenographer entered Lumumba's room all hell broke loose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The raucous history was a long time ago but would hardly serve as a comfortable backdrop for Kennedy's daughter in dealing with a Conservative government. Mr. Harper, who has managed the Obama relationship well considering their differences, would probably prefer the appointment of another rumoured candidate, former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm. She is articulate, charismatic and has the hands-on political experience that Caroline Kennedy lacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea of JFK's daughter serving as ambassador to Canada is appealing in many ways. But not now. The timing isn't right.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathleen Wynne will reach across the aisle with a Speech from the Throne that seeks common ground with Ontario's two opposition parties. But the promises of cost-cutting reforms, more spending on social priorities and more corporate taxes could set the stage for centre-left co-operation between the governing Liberals and the third-party NDP.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major themes of Tuesday afternoon's Throne Speech will include job creation and building a more “fair society.” But a third one, making the minority legislature work, will be overarching – the rookie Premier making policy commitments aimed at proving she will govern more co-operatively than her predecessor, Dalton McGuinty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A government source acknowledged on Monday that the speech will include a nod toward making sure businesses pay their fair share of tax – presumably by curbing exemptions, for entertainment and other purposes, that the NDP refers to as “loopholes.” Other pledges geared toward the New Democrats will include increased spending on home care, a focus on youth unemployment, and allowing social-assistance recipients to keep more earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Promises more aligned with the interests of the Progressive Conservatives will include the implementation of additional recommendations from last year's Drummond Report, and a reiteration of Ms. Wynne's long-term pledge to restore the debt-to-GDP ratio to its prerecession level by restraining spending increases after the deficit's scheduled elimination in 2017-18.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tonally, the speech will attempt to make the case for a tripartisan tackling of Ontario's myriad fiscal, economic and social challenges. “The government does not believe we are irreparably divided,” it will say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In reality, most insiders expect bipartisan co-operation with the NDP is far more likely. While the Liberals' relations with the Tories have defrosted somewhat in recent weeks – Ms. Wynne has already met more often with PC Leader Tim Hudak than Mr. McGuinty did in the preceding 15 months of minority government – the Official Opposition is widely seen to be far more enthusiastic about forcing an election than the NDP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter released on Monday, Mr. Hudak effectively called on Ms. Wynne to spurn the NDP and shift sharply to the right. That demand, seemingly at odds with both the Liberals' political interests and the worldview of a Premier seen to come from her party's centre-left, will evidently not be reflected in Tuesday's text.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Ms. Wynne appears to be drawing heavily from wish lists recently provided by NDP Leader Andrea Horwath. Of those demands, the only one that has been outright rejected is a call for a public inquiry into the controversy around the costly cancellation of the construction of two power plants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That should give the Liberals a good chance of surviving not just a vote on the Throne Speech, but also one on this spring's budget. Having built her brand largely around reasonableness and a willingness to work with others, Ms. Horwath could be hard-pressed to resist the overtures of a Premier showing enthusiasm for Liberal-NDP co-operation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wynne, however, may also find herself struggling with a growing list of NDP demands – a situation that bedevilled Mr. McGuinty for much of last year. With the Liberals having nowhere else to turn for support, the New Democrats could see the number of wishes granted in the Throne Speech as an invitation to put more forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unable to know for certain how long she will be able to govern, the Liberals – who are making much of Ms. Wynne's past as a professional mediator – will if nothing else be hoping that the Throne Speech's open tone helps pin any blame for legislative dysfunction on the opposition parties.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many reasons to doubt a national economic strategy premised centrally on digging out non-renewable resources, then selling them off to foreigners as quickly as possible. But one of the most irrational aspects of the recent energy boom has been its perverse impact on export revenues.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In essence, the faster we extract bitumen and export it, the cheaper it gets. Our regulatory system gives each individual company free rein to export as much as possible, as fast as possible. But the resulting export surge drives down the overall price. Perversely, that undermines each producer's revenue and fails to serve the public interest in maximizing the value of non-renewable resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada both exports oil (from the West) and imports it (to the East). However, because of the depressing effect of unrestrained exports on prices, an incredible gap has emerged between what we pay for imports and what we fetch for exports. Last December, that so-called “Canadian discount” surged to more than $60 a barrel. In essence, we had to export two barrels from the West to pay for each barrel imported to the East. The gap has since narrowed, but it still costs Canadians billions of dollars a year – hurting both oil companies and consumers. Almost half of Canada's petroleum export revenue now goes to pay for petroleum imports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian discount is commonly attributed to clogged southbound pipelines, but this is false. Export pipelines will continue to have capacity for a while, depending on how fast bitumen production grows. The problem is that the regional market those pipelines serve, in the U.S. Southwest, is saturated. Other oil, including new shale oil, has flooded that market, refineries are full-up and U.S. demand is sluggish, partly because of energy conservation measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Politicians at all levels now routinely invoke the Canadian discount as a scapegoat for all their fiscal ailments. Alberta Finance Minister Doug Horner singled out the price differential when he revealed a surprise $3-billion provincial deficit. Federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty did the same, referencing the issue in explaining why his government is $5-billion behind its budget target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is unconvincing, especially at the federal level. Since Ottawa collects no oil royalties, any fiscal benefit from oil exports is indirect and modest, captured largely through corporate taxes from oil companies – taxes that Ottawa has cut in half since 2001. Indeed, Ottawa typically collects less than two cents from each dollar in upstream oil revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real cause of Canada's deficits is the failure to stimulate employment and income growth across the economy. We can hardly single out one industry, petroleum extraction, which produces just 3 per cent of real GDP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, these politicians have another motive for blaming deficits on oil price differentials: They support new export pipelines and hope their fiscal arguments will make those pipelines more palatable to a skeptical public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the problem exists because we're pumping out raw bitumen faster than markets can absorb it, will it really help to pump it out even faster? Few analysts believe the Keystone pipeline to the United States would solve the problem, even if it does get built; at best, it would displace downward price pressure from Oklahoma southward to Louisiana. Pipelines through British Columbia are unlikely to be built, for environmental reasons. And even if Canadian oil could reach Asia, remember that there are similar price risks there – including alternative supplies, conservation and environmental constraints. In sum, the inherent limitations of an economic strategy rooted in the extraction and export of raw resources cannot be overcome by simply finding another foreigner to sell to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sheer waste and irrationality of the Canadian discount should be addressed with alternative measures. Instead of extracting and exporting raw commodities, we should strive to add more value to our resources right here in Canada. Upstream, we could use far more Canadian-made equipment in resource projects. Downstream, we could upgrade and refine the resource instead of saturating export markets with raw output. Even better would be to use Canadian petroleum refined at home to displace the expensive crude currently imported from Britain and Algeria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, this would mean slowing the pace of bitumen expansion, since there's not enough demand in Canada, to absorb all the new bitumen the industry wants to pump. But we would extract much more value from each barrel. And we'd stop cheapening the value of our own non-renewable resources with this mad rush to export.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario's latest Speech from the Throne on Tuesday sets some fine fiscal goals, but Premier Kathleen Wynne will have a hard time reconciling those good intentions with proposals for new spending, of which some are at least partly aimed to obtain the support of Andrea Horwath and the New Democratic Party, in the present minority Legislative Assembly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wynne deserves credit for bringing the legislature back only eight days after she and the new cabinet were sworn – but all too long after the ill-considered prorogation instigated by her predecessor, Dalton McGuinty, last October.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberal government promises to eliminate the deficit in 2017-2018 and, subsequently, to limit spending increases to 1 per cent below GDP growth until the debt-to-GDP ratio is 27 per cent, where it was before the recession of 2008. It also undertakes to keep implementing the rigorous Drummond Report, made public a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The speech was mercifully free of explicit pandering to the NDP, or for that matter to the Conservatives. Ms. Horwath recently demanded a 15-per-cent reduction in automobile insurance premiums; the speech more cautiously offers to work toward reducing them – in any case, at the expense of the insurers not the public purse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Wynne's program includes some substantial new spending commitments, for example, acting upon recommendations from the report last year by Frances Lankin and Munir Sheikh on social assistance, which was generally reasonable, but welfare reforms are rarely fiscally neutral. Likewise, more and better home-care services are desirable but costly. So too is the transportation infrastructure that is promised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As if to delicately distance Ms. Wynne from Mr. McGuinty, the expression “green energy” is not to be found in the Throne Speech. Likewise, local communities are to be consulted about gas plants, casinos, wind plants and quarries – all sore points of the past few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall approach shows considerable continuity, however. Not surprisingly, Ms. Horwath has said that she will support the Speech from the Throne, while Tim Hudak, the Conservative Leader, will oppose it. The provincial Liberals are still governing from the centre-left.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let the critics howl over the new Office of Religious Freedom – it's about time we got a little more respect for religion in this country. On Tuesday, the Prime Minister announced Andrew Bennett as Canada's new ambassador for religious freedom. The Christian college dean and former Privy Council policy analyst with a political science doctorate will launch the long-promised $5-million initiative.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're inclined to believe this is part of Prime Minister Stephen Harper's mission from God to please the social, religious and ethnic conservatives who elected him, consider a few facts; the need for this office in the Foreign Affairs Department is not about politics, but human rights:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Widowed mother Nadia Mohamed Ali and her seven children were recently jailed in Egypt for returning to the Christian faith after the death of her Muslim husband. The World Evangelical Alliance's Religious Liberties Commission reported that Mrs. Ali and her children were each given 15 years in jail. Seven officials at an Egyptian Registry Office received sentences of five years each for processing the change request.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• In Saudi Arabia, police have just arrested 53 Christians for attending worship at the rented home of an Ethiopian Christian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Four young boys in Burlington, Ont., are still waiting for the return of their father, Huseyin Celil, a Canadian citizen and Muslim victim of religious persecution. Mr. Celil spoke out for China's Uyghur minority and was mysteriously arrested in 2006 during a visit to family in Uzbekistan, then deported to China. There, he received a kangaroo court verdict and a life sentence. He now languishes in a remote Chinese jail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take a look at the #religiousfreedom topic on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> to see the litany of personal examples across faiths and the welcome for the office – proof that the partisan and anti-religion jabs are foolishly misguided.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still not convinced? Count the dozens of warring conflicts on our planet and try to find one where religion isn't complicit or at least a factor. Cardus analyst Rob Joustra, writing for The Globe and Mail last September, summed it up well: “Not every problem in the world is religious, but almost every enduring solution will require some level of religious accommodation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The location of the announcement underlined the need. Mr. Harper introduced the new ambassador at a Toronto mosque that has become a refuge for Ahmadiyya Muslims, who have been harshly persecuted in Pakistan. “There are very few nations that are working hard at religious accommodation. We're one of a few nations who have it right. Canada can be an honest broker in this field,” said Richard Landau, author of What the World Needs to Know About Interfaith Dialogue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some may wonder why there is any room for religion in <span class="companylink">Canada's government</span>, but that's not a question we ask of any other Charter-protected human right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Christianity evolved, scribes took note of Jesus's warning that his followers should prepare for hostility. There would be resistance, then rejection, then detainment, then abuse, then pursuit, then death. We feel smug that it could never happen here, but threats to religious freedom begin at the grassroots level, even before official sanction. We don't need to look far in Canadian culture to find examples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new Office of Religious Freedom must speak to all levels of hostility. It's up to the rest of us to make sure Dr. Bennett can point back the Canadian example of how to protect freedoms.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he watched the last 10 minutes from the Leafs' bench after letting in four goals on 14 shots. Scrivens, shouldering the load with James Reimer's knee injury, was replaced by Jussi Rynnas after two goals on long shots in a span of 2:40.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alexander Killorn's shot from the blueline squeezed under Scrivens's pad at 2:49, and Scrivens then waved at Matt Carle's shot, which made the score 4-1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Leafs outshot the Lightning 16-10 through two largely turgid periods, yet they w ere losing 2-1 due to two untimely, if to that point in the game rare, defensive breakdowns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John-Michael Liles was a healthy scratch for the second consecutive game after sitting out Monday's 3-0 win over the <span class="companylink">Florida Panthers</span>, but based on Korbinian Holzer's evening, he'd best prepare himself to play in Thursday's game against the <span class="companylink">Buffalo Sabres</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paired with captain Dion Phaneuf on the Leafs' top unit, Holzer was victimized on the go-ahead goal at 4:46 of the second period when he lost track of Steven Stamkos, who fired a shot past Scrivens from the low slot after Stamkos won the faceoff and circled around while the Leafs gained possession of the puck only to turn it back behind their own goal instead of playing it off the boards and down the ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a strange first period, full of pace but with little in the way of opportunity. Lightning goaltender Anders Lindback looked uncomfortable early in the game and that manifested itself with Mikhail Grabovski's first goal in 11 games, scored at 17:59 of the first period to tie the score at 1-1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grabovski cashed in on a rebound off the glove of Lindback, who was backing up and was off-balance when Nikolai Kulemin fired a wrist shot. James van Riemsdyk scored the Leafs' second goal with less than four minutes left, and Phil Kessel hit the goal post a minute later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vincent Lecavalier took advantage of a Tyler Bozak misplay to give the Lightning a 1-0 lead at 9:25 – ending Scrivens's streak of shutout goaltending at 154 minutes 16 seconds – in what was one of the few clear shots the Lightning had against a Leafs team that seemed prepared to be diligent defensively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Lightning know patience. They came into the game first in the NHL in shooting percentage. Those numbers improved Tuesday night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Leafs' road to history? Not so much.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have always called it The Car Wash, a kind of whirlwind, multimedia interview and promotion session that <span class="companylink">Toronto Blue Jays</span> players go through early in spring training. But on Tuesday the team's owners, <span class="companylink">Rogers Media</span>, went all in: a sound stage under a huge, enclosed tent in the parking lot beside left field at Florida Auto Exchange Stadium, replete with extras as “fans,” a lighted stage and all manner of whiz-bang electronic gimmicks and what-have-yous.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You could buy a million-dollar player with what the thing costs, and still have enough left for another player making the major-league minimum. Maybe two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I had to act and narrate stuff,” Mark Buehrle said, peeling off his jersey in the serenity of an empty clubhouse. “Two things I'm not really good at.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The session took less than an hour, which on some days is enough for five innings work on Buehrle's part. That's significant for catcher J.P. Arencibia. There's been much hand-wringing about whether he can handle R.A. Dickey's knuckleball, but the bigger issue might be how he adapts to Buehrle's pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Sometimes I'm already in my motion when the catcher's just got his knuckles in position to put the sign down,” Buehrle said. “I mean, I know A.J. [Pierzynski, who caught Buehrle with the <span class="companylink">Chicago White Sox</span>] had to learn not to look down before he got set for each pitch. He'd do that, I'd already have my hands going and you could see him thinking ‘Uh-oh, I better throw a sign down right now.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I like to get the sign as fast as I can,” Buehrle added. “I don't like to be out there and be ready and have the catcher kind of sit down and take a few seconds to think. So, it's big that we [he and Arencibia] get on the same page.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arencibia is aware of all this. He's reminded of it every day by somebody with a notepad or a microphone. Indeed, the guess here is that Arencibia and Dickey will enjoy their time away from the Blue Jays during the World Baseball Classic (both are with Team USA) because spring training is just a few days old and already they're part of what seems to be a freak show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arencibia – bless him – still answers all the questions about catching Dickey. Dickey – bless him, too – still seems understanding of the newness he has brought to the team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“R.A. adds something different to our team,” manager John Gibbons said Tuesday. “I don't know what it is. Maybe he just brings attention to the team.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which means attention is transferred to Arencibia, the 27-year-old, four-year major-league veteran who does not receive enough credit for the strides he's made defensively. Arencibia is aware of what people say and think about him because, well, because he cares. He chafed a bit this off-season when he went from being a guy about to be traded, to a guy whose pride was hurt by projections of doom and gloom about his ability to catch Dickey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it came to pace last season, Dickey was the fourth fastest pitcher in the majors per plate appearance; Buehrle was the fastest at 1 minute 3.6 seconds, according to Fangraphs.com. Pace is a big deal, since it keeps fielders on their toes and messes with a batter's comfort zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his previous 12 years in the American League – before his one-year stint with the <span class="companylink">Miami Marlins</span> in the designated hitter-less National League – Buehrle's average time per start of 2 hours 37 minutes 4 seconds was faster than any other pitcher with at least 75 starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buehrle is not a big fan of pitchers and catchers meetings to go over that day's opponent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I won't say I'm not going to go if they tell me I have to,” Buehrle said, “but in Chicago, Coop [pitching coach Don Cooper] and A.J. would do it themselves. I'd stay away. Didn't want any part of it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But nothing aggravates him more than shaking off a catcher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I won't do it unless, you know, it's a situation where it's 3-2 on a hitter and he calls for a curve and I'm not that confident with the pitch on that day,” Buehrle said. “No way I want to walk a guy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This will be a test for Arencibia, to be sure. No longer is he catching guys he came up with, no longer is he catching potential. This time it's all pedigree and track record and perfect games and Cy Young Awards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time's a-wasting. Welcome to the fast track. Welcome to the 2013 <span class="companylink">Toronto Blue Jays</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For three weeks, it was easy to overlook that Kathleen Wynne became Ontario's Premier with a minimal policy mandate, emerging triumphant from a truncated leadership race that mostly dodged the tough questions about Ontario's fiscal and economic troubles.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, in a Speech from the Throne that resembled a group hug more than a vision statement, it showed signs of catching up with her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the extent that the text carved out a different path from that of her predecessor, it was mostly in style. Ms. Wynne aims to be more open and inclusive, to listen to others' ideas rather than ram her own down Ontarians' throats, and that theme was driven home again and again in commitments to work more co-operatively with everyone from opposition parties to public sector unions. A vow to consult communities “from the beginning if there is going to be a gas plant or a casino or a wind plant or a quarry in their hometown” was something of a dig at Dalton McGuinty's disinclination to do likewise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a few fronts, there were notable policy shifts as well. Ms. Wynne appears to be more passionate about upgrading the province's lacklustre transportation infrastructure, and willing to consider road tolls to do so. She is also less reluctant about collecting more corporate tax revenue (possibly by doing away with existing credits) and more eager to make life better for social-assistance recipients – issues that could not only help her win support from the third-party NDP, but also seem to fit her own value system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on the biggest issues, the ones that will inevitably consume much of her attention, her policies remain ambiguous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While recommitting to both the 2017-18 deadline for eliminating the provincial deficit and a leadership campaign promise to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio, she offered little indication of what cost-cutting will look like. An oddly brief section on health-care policy skimmed over the all-encompassing question of how the system will be made more sustainable, other than an expansion of home care and promotion of healthier living. Although job creation, and specifically youth employment, got more attention, it was mostly rhetorical, with only marginal commitments such as a $50-million contribution to a federal-provincial venture capital fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It all gave the impression of a new Premier who is still trying to figure out what she wants to do with her office – which, in the circumstances, is understandable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The promise to return the legislature quickly helped Ms. Wynne win over her fellow Liberals, who were worried about further backlash against them if prorogation continued. But it also led to a mad scramble after her victory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An overhauled Premier's office is only just taking shape, many jobs are still not filled or are being held temporarily. Ministers' offices are in at least as much flux, with a new cabinet – including 10 rookies – appointed only last week. Many of the people who helped craft the agenda, or usually would, are still just finding their way around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If she had come to office in a general election, Ms. Wynne would have had not just more time, but also a relatively comprehensive platform to draw from during her transitional phase. In this case, she has only the sorts of low-risk promises offered during a contest in which the main objective was not to offend too many fellow travellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On top of that, the reality of minority government is being able to do only as much as the opposition will permit – which in this case is really just the New Democrats, since the Progressive Conservatives have no intention of propping up the Liberals regardless. Conversations on that front seem to still be in the exploratory stage, so there are only so many limbs she can rush out on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this Throne Speech was “vague in the extreme,” as NDP Leader Andrea Horwath aptly put it, that can be chalked up in part to it being a placeholder. Such texts being notoriously vague to begin with, the much better test will come with the spring budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it was hard not to notice at the press conference after Lieutenant-Governor David Onley's reading that Ms. Wynne, hedging and frequently stumbling over words, seemed decidedly less relaxed and confident than in her first appearances as her party's new leader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps she was just having a bad day. Or maybe the gravity of what she's up against, and what will be needed from her in the next couple of months, had just caught up with her.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim Hanni is not the first person to thumb his nose at the pompous dogma of wine snobs. But his is no ordinary nose. A vaunted Master of Wine and professionally trained chef, he has spent the past 20 years working with sensory scientists, placing sacred beliefs under the proverbial microscope. His conclusion: Conventional connoisseurship, with its bias for bold, expensive reds and its rigid food-and-beverage-matching rules, needs an overhaul.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His populist manifesto is the subject of a new, self-published book, Why You Like the Wines You Like (available through Amazon). It's a compendium of irreverent, witty rants, science explications, food-and-wine lore and even workbook-style multiple-choice tests to gauge the reader's own style preferences – all designed to put novice wine lovers at ease in the company of geeks. Hanni spoke with The Globe and Mail from his home in Napa, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You coined the term vinotype to convey that people are to some extent physically hard-wired to prefer certain wine styles. Can you elaborate?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's taken from “phenotype.” There's the physiological, genetic aspect of an organism plus adaptations and changes in behaviour – nature plus nurture. Then there's something called phenotypic plasticity, how far an organism may or may not adapt to different environments. If you look at people at the extremes of the sensitivity scale, what we call sweet-hypersensitive at one end and tolerant at the other extreme, they have less natural inclination to adapt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And you say that hypersensitive people tend to prefer delicate sweet wines, like white zinfandel, while tolerant tasters might go for fashionable, powerful reds with high alcohol. Do you know the percentage breakdown?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sweet's the hard one, because they are in the closet. They don't want to face the recrimination of the hip people. But our estimate is that about 40 per cent are in the sweet-hypersensitive camp, while about 35 per cent are in the sensitive group. That leaves about 15 per cent in the tolerant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does this make wine criticism and point scores irrelevant?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not at all. We keep waiting for the 100-point scale to go away, but there are certain vinotypes that it's absolutely perfect for. The question is, “What else is there for others?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Isn't the stigma against white zinfandel based on the fact it's an uncomplex, industrial wine, the oenological equivalent of that cheesy poster of dogs playing poker? Critics are paid to teach us about Matisse, aren't they?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think it's up to the individual. What if you went over to somebody's house and their walls are bare because they are so embarrassed about their art? It's just gotten a bit out of hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, should critics award 95-point scores to Yellow Tail just because millions of people love uncomplicated shiraz?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You should say, “This wine's technically very, very well made, it's got a sweet edge to it. Those of you who want something a little sweet and predictable and whatever – no problem, you'll love it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aren't you reducing pleasure to mere physiological gratification? Some people find allure in geography and boutique craftsmanship. They drink the stories as much as the wine. Is that wrong?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. It just means you're very studious. I've got an audio addiction. I can listen to Wagner one minute and then turn around and listen to Lyle Lovett and His Large Band, which is exquisitely engineered, and I love it in part for the sound engineering. That [technical appreciation] opens the door to make more people enthusiastic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You encourage people to try the “wrong” wines with food, like red with delicate fish or oysters, and white with steak. Does that approach work?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It almost invariably works. Try this : For a month, have all the wrong wines when you get the chance, like pinot grigio with steak. If my mother-in-law hates red wine, she's not going to like red with her steak. She's going to want something delicate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, pair the wine to the diner, not the dinner?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exactly. “Welcome over to my house, I've got a leg of lamb. Who wants red? Who wants white? Who wants sweet? Who wants dry? Who wants a beer? Thank you for being here.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is there any wine style that everybody will like?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't think so, unless you've got an expert at the table and then they're reacting to the expert, not to the wine. The more training we gain, the less natural our reactions to the wines are.</p>

She describes the Duchess as “becoming a jointed doll on which certain rags are hung… a shop-window mannequin, with no personality of her own.” The papers called this a scathing attack, manufacturing some outrage to print between dozens of the “baby bump” pictures shot during the Duchess's first public appearance in which her pregnancy, now in its fourth month, shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 6,000-word piece, delivered as a lecture earlier this month before it was posted on the LRB website, Mantel takes a piercing look at her own reactions to royals in the flesh. The Booker laureate describes attending a reception at Buckingham Palace where she stares at the Queen as “a cannibal views his dinner.” Mantel, whose much praised 2009 novel Wolf Hall is a fictionalized biography of the Tudor minister Thomas Cromwell, then gets to the meat of her subject: She reviews new research into the health of the much-married Henry VIII and looks at the fertility problems that produced a reign whose notorious history is “graphically gynecological.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this context, it is important that the Duchess of Cambridge is young, pretty and now demonstrably fertile, and that is Mantel's introduction. She contrasts Kate's all-important reliability to the tragically unstable egos of Marie Antoinette and Diana, Princess of Wales, writing that the Duchess “seems to have been selected for her role of princess because she was irreproachable: as painfully thin as anyone could wish, without quirks, without oddities, without the risk of the emergence of character.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Missing the point that this is not a criticism of the Duchess herself, whoever she might be, but rather of the public image the press and Palace thrust on her, the tabs have gone into overdrive, denouncing anyone who would say their perfect Kate lacked personality. Prime Minister David Cameron even weighed in, calling Mantel's remarks “completely misguided and completely wrong,” perhaps because the author is questioning the monarchy itself. (She comes to the conclusion that royals are like pandas, fun to look at but unnecessary.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is ironic about this artificial controversy is how the press, despite its new, post-Diana, no-more-phone-hacking propriety, is casting the Duchess in exactly the role Mantel has identified. On the papers' websites, you can watch the video of her appearance Tuesday at an addiction-recovery centre that she supports. She emerges from a car in an elegant, form-fitting dress to be greeted by staff, but all you can hear is the clicking of camera shutters and the occasional “Katherine!” as photographers try to get her to look their way. She waves once; otherwise she acts – and what is it except sheer pretense to ignore the immediate proximity of a phalanx of loudly clicking cameras? – as though they aren't there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Daily Express described her as wearing “an unseasonally summery Max Mara dress” while the Daily Mail wrote that she “braved a chill morning in London wearing only a grey patterned wrap dress.” In other words, after the British press respected the Palace's request not to publish paparazzi shots of her in a bikini that appeared in some U.S. publications last week, the obliging royal showed up at an official event without a coat in a clingy dress so that the photographers could get what they needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the papers, Nick Barton, chief executive of Action on Addiction, describes the Duchess as engaging and filled with intelligent questions, but that is beside the point. The real Kate may have loads of personality, but as Duchess of Cambridge she is the star attraction in a media pageant in which her pregnancy is the next big float. Can she ever lay claim to her private self? Perhaps if, as Mantel urges us “[We] back off and not be brutes,” but the faux furor over her essay suggests we are more eager to pounce than retreat.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sympathy is usually in short supply in politics, but a smidgen of that sentiment might be directed at John Duncan.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Duncan resigned as federal aboriginal affairs minister last week. The media opined that he had been a “weak” minister. Mr. Duncan quit because he sent a character reference to the Tax Court on behalf of a constituent in 2011. He explained that the letter was “written with honourable intentions,” but that it was “not appropriate” for a minister to write to the Tax Court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is what the rules say – keep politicians away from courts and regulatory tribunals. But what if the rules are a little silly?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our system sends people to Parliament to represent and help constituents. What counts is the transparency with which they help. Clearly, private contact between ministers (or MPs) and courts or tribunals would be grossly wrong, since politicians would have privileged access denied to others. But if we insist, as apparently we do, that ministers acting as MPs cannot send a public character reference for a constituent or a letter of support to a regulatory tribunal, then we are saying these elected officials cannot help their constituents in this way, although everybody else can.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further, we are assuming judges and tribunal heads are so corruptible that their judgments would be swayed by a public letter from a minister or MP. If you believe that, you don't have much faith in either the human condition or the integrity of those making judicial or quasi-judicial decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prior to Mr. Duncan's resignation, Ethics Commissioner Mary Dawson upbraided Finance Minister Jim Flaherty and two parliamentary secretaries (MPs) for writing to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission on behalf of constituents competing for a Toronto radio licence. Again, the submissions were public – anybody could read them – and presumably they were among many the CRTC received on the file. Defenders of public virtue would presumably claim these letters sullied, or risked sullying, the CRTC decision. Given the transparency of the submissions, it would be a stretched argument of the holier-than-thou kind so prevalent in today's politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's another reason for a bit of sympathy for Mr. Duncan: the near impossibility of the aboriginal affairs file.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every ministerial portfolio has its challenges, and thanks for a job well done are as rare in politics as sympathy. Every portfolio has lobby groups in various states of agitation, opposition party critics in constant full howl, a media inclined to think the worst and difficult decisions on every front – to say nothing of trying to keep The Boss and his staff at the Prime Minister's Office contented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aboriginal affairs is especially challenging, as anyone who has watched the parade of ministers in that portfolio understands. Privately, it used to be called a survival portfolio, one through which the occupant passed while waiting for a portfolio where objectives could be attained and reputations burnished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Very few aboriginal affairs ministers stay long. They have come with differing approaches over the decades, but it would be hard to identify one whose reputation was made there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some ministers decide to travel to meet with their far-flung constituents in aboriginal Canada, a decision that can make them marginally popular outside Ottawa. But then letters pile up in Ottawa, cabinet meetings are missed, the bureaucracy seizes up and complaints begin. Or the minister can stay in Ottawa, fighting battles, but the charge is then made that he or she doesn't know what's happening on the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Money is always deemed grossly inadequate for evident and pressing needs. The Indian Act is supposed to guide some ministerial decisions but is vilified by those who live under it. Try to reform it and wait for the outcry. Demands that bands of fewer than 1,000 people become self-governing “nations” fill the air, no matter how implausible the realization. Court rulings change the rules of the game, forcing ministers to scramble to adjust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worse, polls consistently show – as they certainly do now – that doing a lot more for aboriginals isn't very popular with the majority of Canadians. And since aboriginals don't vote much in federal elections, there are few votes to be gained in those communities. Politically, the minister is in a classic Catch-22.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the moments leading up to the drop of the puck between the <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span> and <span class="companylink">New York Islanders</span>, the few fans who made it through the grease and slop of a mid-February snowstorm were treated to film clips of past glory.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neil Brady scoring the first ever goal in the team's first ever win back in 1992. The goals that got the team into the playoffs in 1997. The goal that won them the Eastern Conference in 2007. And several goals by a little No. 65 who seemed to move up and down the ice like an electric current.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would be Erik Karlsson, past glory. And No. 19, Jason Spezza, past glory. And perhaps even No. 9, Milan Michalek, perhaps past glory depending on a second evaluation being done on his knee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Immediate past glory was less than a week ago, when Karlsson's Achilles tendon was sliced by Matt Cooke's skate in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seems as long ago as Neil Brady's No. 12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The depleted Senators, fresh off a surprising and welcome 2-1 shootout victory over the <span class="companylink">New Jersey Devils</span> Monday, met the Islanders, fresh off a 7-0 drubbing by the <span class="companylink">Philadelphia Flyers</span> that same night. The Islanders could not solve their sudden lack of scoring, falling 3-1 to give the Senators a second straight win.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With both teams demoralized and tired, the game opened largely as expected: sloppy as the Queensway, sticks cold as the Arctic blast coming down the Ottawa Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The greatest play in the first period was turned in by Ottawa goaltender Craig Anderson's net, when an iron post denied what seemed an easy backhand goal by Islander centre Josh Bailey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senators had expected the Islanders to come out flying in an effort to avenge the lopsided loss to the Flyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Islanders had, after all, won their previous two games and 22-year-old John Tavares had been named <span class="companylink">NHL</span> player of the week after collecting five goals and seven points in three games. He had also scored in all five of his previous road games before arriving in Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Islanders, however, do not have much puck luck with the Senators. Last season, they won but once while losing three times; all time, the Islanders are 19-42-14 against Ottawa, hardly past glory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senators head coach Paul MacLean had promised his team would continue to play the attack style they found success with when Karlsson and Spezza were healthy. Far more knowledgeable experts – no names need be mentioned – had predicted the Senators would have no choice but to turn to a dreary defensive style and pray.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The personnel has obviously changed,” MacLean said Tuesday, “but the way we play hasn't changed.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senators finally scored on a power play after coming into the game on a depressing 0-for-24 streak. Captain Daniel Alfredsson held the puck behind the Islanders' net, slipped it out front into a wild scrum and Colin Greening clipped home only his second goal of the season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Islanders had elected to give struggling backup goaltender Rick DiPietro a start, but he was not the cause of Greening's goal, nor could he be blamed later in the second when ageing rookie (29) Andre Benoit fired a point shot through traffic that DiPietro did not see until it was in the back of his net.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the other end, <span class="companylink">NHL</span> player of the month for January, Craig Anderson, remained brilliant in the Ottawa net. Three times in the second period alone he stopped the dangerous Tavares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tavares was, as expected, by far the most dangerous of the <span class="companylink">New York Islanders</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He's a handful,” said MacLean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Anderson – who came into the game with a gobsmacking .949 save percentage in 14 games – handled him effortlessly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in the third period, however, Anderson's incredible run of luck and posts ran out when, following a series of broken plays and failed clearings in the Ottawa end, the puck came out to defenceman Travis Homonic in the slot and Homonic's high shot found its way past Anderson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A goal post again came into play late in the game when Ottawa defenceman Patrick Wiercioch took a shot from the point that hit the inside of DiPietro's post but just bounced clear of the second post.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DiPietro needed all the help he could get. His curious inability to contain any puck that comes near his glove leads to easy rebounds. One bobbled puck late in the game led to minor-league-callup Dave Dziurzynski scoring his first goal when he simply charged the free puck and DiPietro could not keep it out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sens will next meet the <span class="companylink">New York Rangers</span> on Thursday here and will play host to the <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span> on Saturday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Win those and Ottawa fans will, much to their shock, be talking about current glory.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A good deal of what airs on ABC tonight is Oscar-themed. This smacks of desperation.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's the special episode of 20/20, Mad About Oscar With Katie Couric (ABC, CHCH, 10 p.m.) which promises “Footage of memorable acceptance speeches, hilarious monologues, unscripted moments and red carpet fashion from the Oscar archives.” Now, this sort of pre-AcademyAwards special is not unusual, though it does seem weird that the program looks back at old Oscar evenings rather than focusing on this year's contest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that's not all. Most ABC comedies are also Oscar-related. The Middle (ABC, Citytv, 8 p.m.) has a plot anchored around the mom's character's “upcoming annual tradition of watching the Oscars on TV…” Other allegedly funny stuff happens but plugging Sunday's Academy Awards on ABC is the main point. On The Neighbors (ABC, CTV Two, 8:30 p.m.), the episode is called Larry Bird Presents an Oscar-Winning Film by Larry Bird. There's some nonsense about a spelling bee and two characters being “obsessed” with making a documentary about the bee and winning an Oscar for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Modern Family (ABC, Citytv, 9 p.m.), we are informed, in advance, that Cameron uses baby Joe for a photo shoot, “an Oscar-themed homage to the old Hollywood.” Or something. Anyway, the Oscars shindig gets thrown at viewers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All broadcasters use the multiple platforms available to plug their shows and events these days, but there was a time when this sort of desperate promotion of the Academy Awards would not have been necessary. The glamour and spectacle of Oscar night would have been enough to ensure a mass audience was going to tune in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, not this year obviously. The point of ABC's Oscar-themed sitcoms is to create the impression that everybody – totally, totally, everybody – is buzzing with Oscar fever. This isn't the case, of course. The Academy Awards used to be the biggest show on TV, but it is far from that and in truth it's just another variety program vying for attention. The actual broadcast is long and tedious, and you can be guaranteed that many people who watch it will wish they hadn't wasted their time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps we are watching the Academy Awards in its death throes. Most reasonable people would agree that very few movies now match the best of television in terms of artistic vitality, storytelling vigour and social relevance. That argument is over and television won.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now it seems that even the spectacle of the Academy Awards – the red-carpet coverage, the speeches, the banter of the host – is in need of flagrant, frantic promotion. Possibly, by the time that awards season ends with the Oscars, the public is just bored with the whole thing. As spectacle, the Golden Globes is more compelling, both because the merit of being honoured with a Globe is dubious, making it less prone to pomposity, and because a lot of TV shows are included in the Globes process. And, as the other awards shows roll out, the banality of the movies becomes all the more clear. Come Oscar night, any excitement has fizzled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe, just maybe, even the red-carpet coverage is now an anticlimax. So much attention has been paid to actresses and their frocks and hairdos that even the camp frivolity of watching and making catty remarks from the safety of your couch has lost its appeal. Been there, done that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the actual competition for an Academy Award, that too has become the victim of saturation coverage and speculation. Me, I haven't seen any of the movies nominated, but an hour of online reading and I can be pretty well-informed. As I understand it, Daniel Day-Lewis has the best actor award locked up, Anne Hathaway is guaranteed a win for best supporting actress, Amour wins best foreign film and Adele will certainly win for best song. And most of the cinematography and special effects awards will go Life of Pi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe I'm wrong about some of these. But two things are certain. First, on Monday morning next, most people won't remember much about the details of who-won-what-award. Second, the fact that ABC is flogging the Academy Awards through its sitcoms is further evidence of the increasing irrelevance of Oscar night.</p>

I almost always rise as soon as the person in front of me does, if he or she blocks my view of the curtain call, anyway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The alternative – sitting grumpily and staring at a stranger's backside – seems unnecessarily willful. The only time I stay seated, ironically enough, is when a show has so completely bowled me over that I feel unable to move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many theatre artists find the declining significance of the standing ovation troubling, however. Indeed, they tend to have one of two reactions to it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, there are those in a state of denial. These are perhaps artists who use a standing ovation on a family-and-friends-filled opening night as a psychological shield against reviews – or a weapon to wield against them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Playwright and director Morris Panych does the latter – he first took me to task for shrugging off a standing ovation in the comments section of The Globe and Mail's website five years ago. “Whether people stand slowly, quickly, spring lightly, leap wildly, or whatever other physical contortion is required to legitimize the act, I take it at face value, but then I am not in the business of assigning invented values to art,” he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, after I was less than enthusiastic about Panych's Stratford musical Wanderlust, his partner, designer Ken MacDonald, drew a cartoon of me sitting sullenly in the midst of a standing ovation, an empty thought bubble floating above my head. (It made a great <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> profile photo.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, there are those artists who do recognize that standing, clapping spectators are now merely standing, clapping spectators – sometimes they are wildly enthusiastic, sometimes they just want to beat the traffic – but who can't stand the shift in semiotics. They would prefer audiences stay seated unless they've really had their socks knocked off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caleb McMullen, the co-founder and artistic producer of Mnemonic Theatre in Vancouver, is on a mission to re-educate audiences on ovations. Last week, he blogged about “an idea to remedy ‘the compulsory Canadian standing O',” a follow-up to an earlier post where he expressed his worries that “Canadian theatregoers are willing to accept the underwhelming” and are not responding honestly to plays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McMullen's idea is to insert the following text into your program, as he plans to do for Mnemonic's upcoming production of David Auburn's Proof: “To help us better understand your level of satisfaction with our presentation please: give us a standing ovation if you are incredibly satisfied, a seated applause if you are satisfied, and complete silence if you are rather indifferent … and (dare I say…) a vocal ‘boo' if you were unsatisfied.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While McMullen yearns for increasingly archaic audience behaviour, he otherwise lives in the 21st century – and so elicited my feedback to his immodest proposal on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> last week. I responded that it was a terrible, naive, insulting idea – and that perhaps he might include a program note explaining when and how to laugh and cry as well. How's that for honest response? At the end of the day, I'll take the artist who takes his audience's reactions at “face value” – as Panych does – over one who is contemptuous of his audience and believes them to be liars or sheep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking up the expression “standing ovation” in the Oxford English Dictionary, I was surprised to find the earliest citation is from 1969. But, of course, that makes sense – Shakespeare and Molière certainly wouldn't have made a big deal of standing spectators since so many would have been erect the whole show long in the pit or the parterre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there is a simple way to find out whether audiences truly like your show: It's called the box office. If McMullen really wants to be sure his audiences aren't lying, he could always offer a money-back guarantee.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘We are the vile offspring of the predatory Spaniards who came to America to bleed her white and to breed with their victims,” Simon Bolivar, the Liberator, wrote in 1826 as his dream of a Gran Colombia, uniting the new South American republics, succumbed to the rivalries and intrigues of competing caudillos – military dictators. “Later the illegitimate offspring of these unions joined with the offspring of slaves transported from Africa. With such racial mixture and such a moral record, can we afford to place laws above leaders and principles above men?”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A long parade of dictators used the cult of Bolivar to mask and decorate the rough edges of Venezuelan society. The first of them was Jose Antonio Paez, the warlord of the southern plains who displaced the Liberator at the head of Venezuela's government and later brought Bolivar's remains back to Caracas from Colombia in 1842. Later dictators – Antonio Guzman Blanco in the 1870s and 1880s, Juan Vicente Gomez (1908-35), Marcos Perez Jimenez (1948-58) – believed they embodied Bolivar's spirit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since he was first elected President in 1998, Hugo Chavez has carried the cult to an extreme, renaming the country the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Mr. Chavez did not go so far as to claim to be the reincarnation of Bolivar, who was a scion of the white creole aristocracy. Nevertheless, he declared a certain resemblance, announcing that they were both zambos, a racial mixture of black and Indian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Bolivar was not white,” Mr. Chavez announced after ordering <span class="companylink">PDVSA</span>, the state oil company, to spend $450,000 in 2006 for a carnival procession in Rio de Janeiro that carried a 12-metre-high effigy of Bolivar on a huge float. “Bolivar was born among the blacks, was more black than white. He did not have green eyes. Bolivar was a zambo.” Anthropologist Patricia Marquez observed that poor people backed Mr. Chavez because he was “one of them,” a dark-skinned army officer from the village of Sabaneta, where the southern foothills of the Andes slope into the vast savannahs that form the often violent frontier with Colombia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, Mr. Chavez returned to Caracas after almost two months in Havana for his fourth surgery to remove recurrent tumours in his abdomen. While he was there, Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolas Maduro met at least five times with Cuban President Raul Castro and Vice-President Ramiro Valdes, who for many years ran the Castro regime's security apparatus. Mr. Valdes now supervises the bulk of the 40,000 Cubans sent to Venezuela as doctors, sports instructors, planners, military advisers and intelligence agents, many of them embedded in Venezuela's armed forces, foreign and finance ministries, ports, electricity grid, central bank and intelligence agency. The Cubans also won contracts to create electronic passports and identification cards, concentrating the personal data of all 30 million Venezuelans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of these Cuban services are paid for in cash and in exchange for more than 100,000 barrels daily of Venezuelan crude oil sold to Cuba at deeply discounted prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The notion of an emergent “Cubazuela” remains a sensitive issue, especially among the Venezuelan military, despite purges of the officer corps to remove those resentful of Cuban interference. Whatever the immediate outcome of Mr. Chavez's demise, Venezuela will remain a polarized society for the foreseeable future, and Chavismo will remain a contender in Venezuelan politics, in the same way that Peronismo remains a vital force in Argentina.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, Venezuela is now threatened with severe inflation, having run through nearly $1-trillion, mainly from oil revenues and loans, since Mr. Chavez took office. Consumer inflation, despite price controls and massive import subsidies, is poised to burst far above the official annual rate of 20 per cent. Estimates of the fiscal deficit run as high as 17 per cent of GDP, beclouded by large off-budget funds accessible only to Mr. Chavez and his closest aides. On Feb. 8, the currency was devalued by 32 per cent, which will give the government more cash to pay salaries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venezuela has been saved from economic collapse by the surge of oil prices over the past decade. Nevertheless, despite boasting some of the world's biggest petroleum reserves, production has fallen from 3.2 million barrels a day in 1998 to 2.8 million today, thanks to politicization, mismanagement and corruption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venezuela became a leading importer of gasoline and diesel from the United States after a series of major accidents at its refineries and other installations, attributed to poor maintenance, which is also blamed for chronic electricity blackouts throughout the country. The leading symptom of social disorder is the epidemic of murders and kidnappings, which have turned Caracas into one of the world's most dangerous cities and more than quadrupled the national homicide rate since 1998 to 73 per 100,000 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venezuela is not all ruin. It still produces star athletes, beauty queens and an internationally acclaimed system of youth symphony orchestras, financed by the government. But the pity of it is that, in the 1970s and 1980s, it was a beacon of stable democracy in a region then plagued by dictators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, it stands as a warning to the rest of Latin America of the costs of degradation and failure of public institutions. The story of Venezuela describes the impact of surging oil revenues on weak institutions, compounded by rapid urbanization. After Mr. Chavez has gone, Venezuela will remain burdened by poverty and conflict until coherent initiatives are developed in long-term efforts to overcome disorder and polarization. The economy is in tatters while many potential successors, civilian and military, compete to assume a dubious legacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of this legacy is the splitting of democratic trends in Latin America between populist regimes exploiting weak institutions – as in Venezuela, Bolivia, Argentina and Ecuador – and more cautious republics such as Chile, Peru, Colombia and Mexico, which strive for stability, growth and social justice through deeper engagement with the world economy.</p>

If the report is accurate, which it seems to be, this means the Chinese government is responsible for years of malicious cyberattacks on American and Canadian corporate and government computers. This is a watershed moment in relations between China and the West, with stakes that are critical to the future security of Canada and the United States.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Barack Obama alluded to the growing menace of cyber-espionage in his State of the Union address last week when he said, “Our enemies are … seeking the ability to sabotage our power grid, our financial institutions, our air-traffic control systems.” His words parallel what the security firm, <span class="companylink">Mandiant</span>, has reported in great technical detail, as well as recent findings of the House Intelligence Committee in Washington: that dozens of cyberattacks that targeted North American military contractors, chemical plants, mining and pharmaceutical companies, satellite and telecommunications firms, media companies and public utilities since 2006 can be linked to the Chinese military.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the New York Times, which commissioned the <span class="companylink">Mandiant</span> investigation after being hit by cyberattacks from China, the most serious incident involved the Canadian branch of an American company whose software lets oil and gas pipeline companies, as well as power-generating utilities, open and close valves and turn switches on and off, remotely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not just China that is dangerous. Iran targeted American banks in an effort to damage the U.S. economy as retaliation for economic sanctions imposed as a result of Iran's continuing nuclear program. The United States, meanwhile, damaged Iran's nuclear program in 2010 through the use of a virus developed by the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada and the United States must sharply rebuke the Chinese government. Its past denials of any involvement in China-based cyberespionage have a hollow tone to them now. China should immediately de-escalate its “digital war” on the West.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The B.C. Liberals will head into this spring's provincial election campaigning on a surplus budget they insist is based on fact not fiction.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while there are certainly elements of fiscal prudence built into the financial document tabled by Finance Minister Mike de Jong Tuesday, there is also at least one ugly battle the government will need to win in order to make its final numbers add up. The government's fiscal model relies on stringent spending measures – including a clampdown on health-care costs that defies our times and would seem destined to force a showdown with the province's doctors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In order to get to its bottom line, the Liberals also had to make some uncomfortable ideological choices, which include raising taxes on corporations and the rich. And in the runup to an election, the government was being criticized for tabling a budget that contains measures for which it has historically criticized the New Democratic Party. In fact, the Liberals were being accused of tabling a very NDP-like budget, one that takes money from the wealthy and increases spending on social programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, B.C.'s fiscal plan is one that powerhouse provinces such as Ontario, Quebec and even Alberta must regard with some envy. B.C.'s closest neighbour is expected to present a deficit budget next month as a result of the $6-billion hole that recently ripped through its revenue projections because of a sudden decline in crude oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario and Quebec, meantime, face their own stiff fiscal challenges, not to mention climbing debt figures that remain costly albatrosses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the new B.C. budget, taxpayer-supported debt (which excludes Crown corporations and ancillary agencies) is forecast to be $42.6-billion in 2013-14 and increase to $46.1-billion in 2015-16. As a percentage of GDP, the debt in the coming fiscal year will be 17 per cent and peak at 18.3 per cent in 2014-15 before beginning to decline the following year, according to government forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, Ontario's debt-to-GDP ratio sits at 36.9 per cent, while Quebec's is an eye-popping 48 per cent. Mr. de Jong said the difference in debt-servicing costs between Ontario and B.C., for instance, frees up about $2-billion a year in interest charges that he can use for programs and services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. de Jong said he was hopeful that the province would be able to keep its prized Triple-A credit rating – one recently threatened to be downgraded by a leading bond agency – as a result of its new fiscal plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The B.C. budget also highlighted why the province has emerged from recent economic storms in better shape than many other parts of the country: diversification. The financial fortunes of the province are not nearly as dependent on the economic health of the United States as they once were.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The B.C. government has projected it will finish the current fiscal year with a $1.2-billion operating deficit; which is just a little less than the amount Mr. de Jong needed to find in order to present the surplus budget that he did. How did he perform this economic miracle? By selling off government assets, factoring in some economic growth and putting the clamps on spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One area of expenditure management that caught many people's attention was the modest projected growth in health-care spending over the next three years. The government is suggesting it contain those costs to an average of 2.6 per cent. And while B.C. has certainly led the nation in bending health-care costs downward, in order to realize the containment they are looking for now they will need to negotiate a new contract with doctors that allows for a net-zero wage increase – something that hasn't been done in recent memory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the extent all budgets are political documents, this one takes on special significance given that the province is less than three months away from an election. Is there enough in this one to change Liberal fortunes, to get those who may believe it's time for a change to perhaps give this government one more chance? Only time will tell.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Christy Clark of British Columbia and Michael de Jong, the Minister of Finance, deserve praise for a sober pre-election budget, which does not attempt to buy the voters with their own money. Although the 1-percentage-point increase in the corporate income-tax rate is regrettable, a balance or modest surplus after four successive deficits is an accomplishment in hard times – difficult especially for a natural-resource-based provincial economy – when the other large Canadian provinces are in deficit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the fixed election date of May 14 may mean that the Legislative Assembly will not have time to pass this budget, it should at least be acknowledged as a campaign document that contains very few crowd-pleasing elements. On the contrary, a rise in medical-services premiums will heighten awareness of health-care costs.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The foolish return to the Provincial Sales Tax on April Fool's Day, 2013 – not the choice of the provincial Liberals, but of the voters – adds to the difficulties that the government faces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the sake of the province's international competitiveness, it would have been better if Mr. de Jong's budget had limited the corporate-tax increase from 10 to 11 per cent to just a few years, much as was done with the personal rate increase for people with incomes of more than $150,000, for just two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers in this budget appear to be solid. The Vancouver Board of Trade has found the $1.1-billion savings in government departments to be plausible, and projected natural-gas revenues were revised downward by $379-million, at the instance of an independent economist, Tim O'Neill, a former vice-president of the Bank of Montreal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hitherto, the Clark government had not shown a seriousness on policy equal to that of Gordon Campbell, the previous premier. There might have been some merit in a less coldly technocratic way of governing, but for the most part the result has been a lack of a sense of direction. This budget, however, shows some resolve. “When a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight,” said the literary critic and lexicographer Samuel Johnson 21/2 centuries ago, “it concentrates his mind wonderfully.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same is true of a prospect of election defeat in three months. Mr. de Jong's budget is a credible, creditable document.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much has been said about the fact that the three youths shot to death in Toronto in the past few weeks were all a mere 15 years old. Quite a bit has been said about the fact that they all died in public housing. Very little has been said about another fact – all three were black.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Street violence is taking a tragic toll on black men and boys in this city. Both as victims and as perpetrators, they are caught up all too often. If you pick up the paper or turn on the computer after reports of a shooting, stabbing or violent robbery, chances are the face staring out at you will be black.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pockets of the city where unemployment and dropout rates are high, where many sons grow up without a father, where gangs and guns are all around, have become dangerous traps for what social workers call at-risk youth. More often than not, they turn on each other. Black-on-black violence is a disfiguring stain on the face of the city's multicultural success. It is an uncomfortable truth that, as a welcoming and liberal city, we prefer to ignore. The political class won't talk about it for fear of being labelled racist. The media are almost as cowed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In days of coverage after the killing of Jarvis Montaque, the latest of three 15-year-olds to be gunned down, it was almost never mentioned. The first honest reference I heard was on Wednesday's Metro Morning , the CBC Radio show that has been bolder than most at exploring the roots of this sad phenomenon. “Why are we losing young black men in the city?” asked host Matt Galloway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is an urgent question, but you won't often hear it asked, much less answered. Politicians prefer the euphemism “youth violence.” Michael Thompson, Toronto's only black city councillor, told me that it's not just black Torontonians who are affected. Even in the three recent killings, “I think it's really about young residents of Toronto who happen to be black.” He said the real problem is the easy availability of firearms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alvin Curling, a former provincial cabinet minister who helped write a report on youth violence, told The Globe and Mail's Sunny Dhillon that it's not a black problem. It's a societal and community problem, with roots in poverty and mental-health issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caution and sensitivity about this problem are understandable, even necessary. No one wants to be accused of stigmatizing a whole community because of a troubled subsection. It should go without saying that for every black youth that gets in trouble, there are many more who are doing fine. But caution too often becomes denial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is hard to to admit that the city that calls diversity its strength is failing at least one important group. “At no point did the government say, ‘We have to tackle this problem in Toronto and the GTA of African-Canadian youth killing each other,” said Knia Singh, of the African Canadian Coalition of Community Organizations. “People were scared to say it was a black problem before, but we want it to be identified as such because it is.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, he said, “It's not white kids killing white kids. It's not Chinese kids killing Chinese kids. It's not even black kids killing white kids or Chinese kids or vice versa. It's mostly black kids killing black kids.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As long we keep ducking that fact, he said, we won't be able to find solutions or aim resources where they are most needed: at troubled black youth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just what those solutions are is hard to say. Dozens of worthy programs and heaps of earnest reports have fallen short. Mr. Singh, a University of Toronto student and former Green Party candidate, thinks that the roots of the problem lie in the legacy of slavery and ongoing systemic racism that pigeonholes young black men as losers or troublemakers. The last thing he wants to do is contribute to that stereotyping. “This is not an excuse for people to come out and say, ‘Look, blacks are killing blacks so they're all criminals and they're all gangsters.' ” Instead, “This is an opportunity to say, ‘Blacks are killing blacks. Why?' ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until we grapple with that question instead of tiptoeing around it, we won't have even a ghost of a chance at progress.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs fellow and editor of the Canadian Foreign Policy Journal at Carleton University</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The appointment of Andrew Bennett, an obscure bureaucrat turned academic from a small religious school in Ottawa, to lead the Office of Religious Freedom in the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) is part of the Conservative government's one-two punch to capture the ethnic-minority vote.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some time now, the department has toyed with the idea of a “global citizens” agenda, a nascent policy that would see Ottawa tapping into expatriate and diaspora expertise to advance Canadian trade and cultural and development interests overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Office of Religious Freedom has a much more specific mandate to monitor the state of the world's religious minorities, evaluate the risks they face and provide policy advice to the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, <span class="companylink">Public Safety Canada</span>, the department created a few years after 9/11, responsible for critical infrastructure and the security of Canadians, has been relying on a high-level panel of religious leaders to facilitate dialogue among their communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All three ideas take their cue from DFAIT's U.S. counterparts, where equivalent organizations and policies have been in place for more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics who argue that the office is further evidence of the creeping incursion of religious and right-wing ideology into Canadian politics have got it all wrong. This isn't about the separation of church and state – it's about catering to ethnic minorities at home and poking a stick in the eyes of the government's chosen opponents abroad. Yes, the office will appeal to Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Christian base, but that support was already firm. The office is mostly another means to increase the political gains the Harper government has achieved among new Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the office is deliberately housed behind DFAIT's closed doors. As such, its evaluations and recommendations will always be politically tinged. There is precedence: Under Jean Chrétien, Foreign Affairs ministers hosted the Canadian Centre for Foreign Policy Development, an in-house think tank. The centre was dismissed by many academics and disliked by the foreign service. It died a slow death because its lack of independence meant it wasn't taken seriously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, those who matter most to Mr. Harper are new Canadians. By the middle of this decade, more than six million Canadians will be foreign-born. Immigrants now account for more than 70 per cent of Canada's labour force growth. Many new Canadians come from places where religious minorities are at risk. Advancing their interests – even indirectly, by championing the rights of their brethren back home – is astute politics. With diplomatic privileges equivalent to those of an ambassador, Mr. Bennett will be pressing the flesh with religious leaders around the world. Those kinds of photo ops play out extremely well in ethnic newspapers – as Immigration Minister Jason Kenney is keenly aware.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who gets to decide which groups should be promoted and why is a different matter. There are more than 240 minorities at risk in the world, and more than a third of those are members of religious sects and groups. One must question the utility of targeting specific religious minorities when such diversity and complexity abounds. While some members of a group may be persecuted, it does not mean that all are and it certainly does not mean that such persecutions are fixed over time. For example, Syria's Alawites fear persecution now that their leader, President Bashar al-Assad, is about to be toppled. So discriminating among worthy cases will certainly pose difficulties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Targeting minorities of a country against which the Harper government has taken a firm stand is not without serious consequences. Christians in Iran, Pakistan, Egypt and China are likely to be high on the office's list, but so are Baha'is, Ahmadi, Shia and Uyghur Muslims, Sikhs, Hindus, Tibetan Buddhists and practitioners of Falun Gong. Meddling in the affairs of India, China, Pakistan and Iran is an unwise course of action for a country seeking to broaden its diplomatic influence and trade ties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other ways to give religious minorities a voice. These options range from the highly formalized to light and informal procedures, including developing rights-centred institutions at home and abroad and fast-tracking access to Canadian citizenship. The ultimate goal should be to empower religious minorities while maintaining independence from government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian Multiculturalism Act is intended to “preserve and enhance the multicultural heritage of Canadians while working to achieve the equality of all Canadians.” A coherent policy toward religious minorities should endorse their activities while encouraging them to uphold their heritage and identity independent of political affiliation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, we should seek to distance religious minorities from the agendas of specific governments, immunizing them in a sense from the vagaries of short-term political opportunism.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report from <span class="companylink">Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</span> says your retirement is in trouble. When you're done working, your standard of living could on average be 30 per cent lower than it was in your best earning years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CIBC explains this retirement shortfall as being the result of lower savings rates, lower investment returns and both fewer and lesser quality pension plans in the workplace. The solutions: Increased savings and government action. In fact, CIBC chief executive officer Gerry McCaughey said in speech this week that the Canada Pension Plan should be adjusted so that people can voluntarily add contributions beyond what they're already kicking in through payroll deduction at work. Great idea, but make those extra contributions automatic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People born during the Second World War are most likely to have the same standard of living in retirement that they did while working. From there, average living standards in retirement decline gradually. The worst-off segment of the population? “It's the young guys,” said Benjamin Tal, the CIBC economist who co-authored the report. “If you were born in the 1940s, you're fine.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Find a job and save your brains out for retirement, Gen Y. And, educate yourself on the ways the older generation helped you get into this mess. For starters, there's the idea that the way to build wealth is to buy a home rather than by saving. It worked for the baby boom generation, which has seeded this idea into the financial system and popular culture. It's an amazingly friction-free process to get a mortgage that ruins your chances of saving properly for retirement, while also having some disposable income to enjoy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CIBC's report acknowledges that rising home values have boosted personal net worth, which helps to offset the decline in the savings rate. But it also points out that converting a house to cash is tough because of the need to spend money on a replacement home or cover rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The older generation also bears responsibility for damaging the global financial system so badly five years ago that it's still not working properly. That's why we continue to have interest rates so low that returns on savings accounts remain firmly between zero and 2 per cent, and why expectations for stock market returns remain subdued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low rates and weak stock market returns hold back growth in retirement savings, CIBC notes. This growth slowed after the 1990s, when boomers were fattening their registered retirement savings plans, and then slowed even more after the big market crash in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gen Y, the older generation also took away your pensions. CIBC says that one-third of the Canadian work force is now covered by a company pension plan, down from 37 per cent in 1992. Of the pensions that continue to exist, many companies have replaced defined benefit plans for new recruits with defined contribution plans. A defined benefit plan weighs a variety of factors in determining a set monthly pension payout for life after you retire. A defined contribution plan is like a DB plan in that it includes contributions from both employees and employers, but payments in retirement are not guaranteed and subject to fluctuations in financial markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, CIBC says almost six million people face a drop of 20 per cent or more in their standard of living in retirement. Don't confuse this with income – standard of living refers here to the ability to consume the same goods and services as you did while in your peak earnings years, with adjustments made for you being older. “More than 20 per cent is a significant reduction in the standard of living,” said Mr. Tal. For some people, it could, hypothetically, be like a 50-per-cent reduction in their income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gen Y, you're in the worst shape of all. You've been putting houses ahead of savings, your investment returns are weak, and you're losing out on pensions. You're seeing your government retirement benefits crimped. Last year's federal budget raised the minimum age for receiving Old Age Security for future retirees while keeping current retirees whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, and about that ‘Find a job and start saving' advice. A survey by <span class="companylink">Sun Life Financial</span> suggests that only one-quarter of Canadians plan to retire at age 66. In a few years, you could be competing for jobs with your parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gen Y, what's your message to employers, educators, parents and politicians? I'm opening a forum on my <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> personal finance community for you to speak up.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many of his brethren, economist Jock Finlayson thought the balanced-budget legislation that debuted in Canada more than two decades ago was a good idea.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The principle underlying the laws first introduced in this country by the B.C. Social Credit Party in 1991 made sense – in theory, at least. The laws bound provincial politicians to balance their budgets, reduce debt and hold the line on spending. Over the years, British Columbia would be joined by other provinces, each of which tweaked their balanced-budget rules to suit the governing ideology of the day, not to mention the economic times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For many reasons, these laws made sense,” says Mr. Finlayson, chief policy officer at the <span class="companylink">Business Council of British Columbia</span> and one of the leading economic forecasters in the country. “But I think the record shows the legislation hasn't really accomplished what it set out to achieve.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Finlayson didn't just come to this view out of nowhere. He was persuaded, in part, by a study done by two University of Manitoba academics who looked at the value of such legislation. Effective Tool or Effectively Hollow? economist Wayne Simpson and political scientist Jared J. Wesley asked in a paper published last year by Canadian Public Policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The paper offers a fascinating look at the evolution of balanced-budget legislation in Canada. (Just three provinces – Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador – don't have some form of these laws.) It's interesting to note, for instance, that in most cases edicts governing deficits and spending were introduced when economic and budgetary conditions were favourable – in other words, when it was easy for governments to square their books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But balanced-budget laws were also intended to impose fiscal discipline – to act as a drag on expenditures relative to revenue growth – the idea being that surplus funds could be saved for those cyclical downturns that invariably afflict boom-and-bust, resource-based economies like those in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In doing their research, however, the report's authors found quite the opposite. “In every case but British Columbia, expenditure growth has increased after the enactment of BBL [balanced-budget legislation], and in the majority of cases (Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and New Brunswick) it has outstripped the increase in revenue growth,” the report says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond that, the study found that balanced-budget laws were no match for the Great Recession. Many provinces simply suspended their legislation to allow for deficits. B.C. just balanced its books after four deficit budgets but had to sell almost a billion dollars in public assets to do it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authors conclude that, for the most part, balanced-budget laws in Canada have failed to live up to expectations. “It seems clear that, like any other piece of legislation, BBL is only as strong as the political will and public support underlying it,” they say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For his part, Mr. Finlayson thinks it's time to reconsider the efficacy of these laws. At the provincial level, revenues can be volatile, which makes budget forecasting highly unreliable. If a provincial government is going to be truly bound by its balanced-budget laws, it would have to establish a sizeable fiscal reserve to provide relief in the event of an unexpected deterioration of economic conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Finlayson believes that for a resource-based economy like B.C.'s, that forecast allowance would have to be about 5 per cent of the budget, slightly more than $2-billion. The allowance in the B.C. budget tabled Tuesday was a quarter of that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And of course, when an economy suffers a catastrophic shock, such as the financial crisis of 2008, governments need the flexibility to respond, Mr. Finlayson says. In such cases, balanced-budget decrees will be ignored or amended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So it's clear that these laws, whatever their symbolic utility, aren't binding,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's his view that governments should concentrate more on public debt than the accounting of any particular year. It is accumulative debt, not deficits, that the credit-rating agencies worry about. Yet only a modest amount of total taxpayer-supported debt is made up of past deficits. Most of it is from borrowing for capital spending projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This underscores the oddity of focusing so much attention on the annual operating budget – is it in deficit, surplus or balanced? – when the level and change in debt is really the issue,” says Mr. Finlayson. “And it's time we started to think about that.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nadine Gordimer's 1998 novel The House Gun describes a familiar post-apartheid South Africa scenario: A white boy kills his housemate with “the house gun.” His parents cannot believe that he would do so deliberately. This narrative – white-on-white violence in a security-obsessed, gun-savvy, walled society – is in contrast to the other great narrative of white South African literature: arming oneself against the impoverished hordes outside the walls. And it is these two narratives – the “conflicting accounts” as the papers say – that are competing in the case of Oscar Pistorius.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The obsession with security is a staple of the nation's literature as of its life. My dad, an English prof, bought a Beretta pistol in his hometown of Johannesburg in the late 1950s, when he was around 19. Most white men did. He took my mom out for target practice on the veldt, something she hated. He said they had to learn to defend themselves. Only whites had guns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One kept one's gun in one's bedside table, or under one's bed, as Pistorius did, and so the stories of accidental shootings were common – the husband who wakes in the middle of the night to strange noises and blasts away at his own wife was already a known phenomenon. One also always had a cricket bat to hand – an everyday object there, in the white suburbs, but also of a useful size for close quarters. In fact, my dad kept his boyhood cricket bat with him through his continental migrations, as much for self-defence as for nostalgia, and even in late middle age would talk quite seriously of taking it over to the student neighbours' parties if they were too loud. This was in Halifax, where cricket-bat retribution would not have been looked on indulgently by the authorities; we had to remind him of this late at night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all the shootings that he grew up with were accidental, of course. He told me of one obstreperous neighbour, in their new and isolated subdivision of the mid-sixties, who waved a handgun around when he was angry. He was burly, this guy, and he complained a lot about another neighbour's barking dog. The two men had a confrontation over the garden fence, with the little yappy dog present. The burly guy threatened to shoot the dog, and the neighbour said, sarcastically, “Good idea, shoot the dog.” And blammo, he did. The armed guy won that dispute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, it was best to have guns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once, the aggressive neighbour – we'll call him Hans – called my dad in the middle of the night. He needed help: He had just shot “a black” at his front garden gate. The black had been trying to open it. Now Hans needed help hauling the would-be burglar's body through the gate and onto the property, so that all would be in order when the police arrived. If the black was on your property, then of course you had a right to shoot. The way my dad explained it, the request for body-displacement was also a not-uncommon neighbourly exchange in those days. And what are you going to say to a guy like Hans?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was just before the very high walls sprang up around every middle-class property, before the tightly girded condo communities like Pistorius's, with their pools and their guard towers and their private security firms. Nowadays, after a shooting, accidental or otherwise, one might not call the police at all; one would call security. Or, like Pistorius, the property manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the private security firms began to supplant the police for the middle class, toward the end of the white government, their ranks were filled with former South African Defence Force soldiers, the trained defenders of the regime. Many of these men had, owing to compulsory military service, seen some sort of violent action in South Africa's border wars. The SADF had become adept, at that point, at designing and improvising their own weapons, since they were denied arms sales by most of the world. My dad used to relish telling me about some of their most ingenious devices: He particularly liked describing a sawn-off, fully automatic, drum-magazine shotgun he had seen – basically an indiscriminate crowd-clearing shot-sprayer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To this day, the security firms will arrive faster than the police, and with machine guns. When you call them, you are calling in a great deal of firepower. Pistorius himself had a lot of firepower, right in the bedroom where he slept with Reeva Steenkamp, whom he is charged with killing, according to South African media. Reports have said that he had his own machine gun, and had recently applied for licences for six more guns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In most white South African fiction, though, the threat to the characters' safety is not seen to be coming from their own security systems: It comes from outside. Something Out There, a 1984 novella by Gordimer, portrays a genteel white suburb frightened by rumours of some large animal, possibly an ape or an orangutan, that keeps being sighted, and might break into your home at night. The unidentified animal is heavily symbolic of the African population itself, and the invisible gathering storm. The allegorical 1980 J.M. Coetzee novel sums up the expectation in its title alone: Waiting for the Barbarians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout the 1980s, most of the world expected a revolution and a bloodbath in that place; Gordimer herself fantasized this end in July's People, a work of speculative fiction that is set after the revolution has come and whites are being hunted and hidden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That bloodbath never came. But white insecurity only grew, and since apartheid ended in 1994 there are more guns than ever. Coetzee's 1999 novel Disgrace concretized post-apartheid fears: The violence actually does come from the disenfranchised outside the front door, the second you open the door to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The danger without and the danger within: Which is the more difficult to assess? Nadine Gordimer's characters, in their fortifications, came, over 40 years, to the jarring realization that violent death can come not only from the tribal hordes outside the walls, but from inside the heavily armed house, from inside the bedroom even.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is what happened to 200 passengers stranded for the length of time it takes to fly from Toronto to Tel Aviv on the tarmac at Pearson International Airport on Feb. 8. The Sunwing Airlines flight to Panama and Costa Rica finally took off 17 hours after its scheduled departure.

If the industry does not take more initiative, MPs should consider changes to federal law similar to the ideas contained in the proposed Bill C-459, introduced by José Nunez-Melo, an NDP MP from Laval, Que.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Air Passengers' Rights bill sets out the right for passengers to be informed about delays, and policies around rerouting, cancellations, delays as well as “tarmac rights.” These are not radical measures. In fact, they are in keeping with those imposed by the <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Transportation</span>, which stipulates a three-hour limit for domestic flight delays, and a four-hour limit for international delays. (Otherwise, the airline must pay a large fine.) Bill C-459 would make it obligatory for passengers who are delayed on the tarmac to be offered food and drinks, as well as the option of disembarking; otherwise, they would be entitled to compensation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This bill, in its second reading in the House of Commons, is unlikely to pass; a similar one was defeated in 2009.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gibbons said he will give “most of the guys the green light [to run],” but added: “We're too good an offence to rely on manufacturing runs. You don't want to end the inning with the wrong guy at the plate instead of having a shot to blow open an inning because of a stupid base-running error.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And you can never get caught stealing third base with two out. That should never happen.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The statistics and the naked eye bear out that baseball has become a different offensive game as it continues to purge its system of steroids and increases the focus on human growth hormone (HGH) and other performance-enhancing drugs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Blue Jays figure to have a different offensive dimension this season as well, given the addition of the likes of speedsters Jose Reyes and Emilio Bonifacio. Waiting at Triple-A Buffalo is Anthony Gose, who could become one of the game's dominant base-stealers. And the Blue Jays have hired Tim Raines (808 stolen bases in his lengthy major-league career) as a minor-league base-running instructor for the next generation (such as Dwight Smith and D.J. Davis).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reyes is an accomplished base-stealer in his own right, of course, but when Rickey Henderson was a coach with the <span class="companylink">New York Mets</span>, he sounded him out and Reyes said he will tap into Raines's knowledge, too. Reyes has stolen 410 bases in 513 career attempts and his 40 with the <span class="companylink">Miami Marlins</span> last season was his most since 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says he has a deliberate approach to using spring training to hone that part of his game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Mostly, I work on my style more than the results,” said Reyes, who will play for the Dominican Republic in the 2013 World Baseball Classic. “In the spring, I like to work on getting a good jump and getting a comfortable lead when the chances are there.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reyes said when he was with the Mets (the first nine years of his career), he would sometimes use a set of personal signals between himself and the batter hitting behind him in the event he reached first base. It's not uncommon, especially for clubs with clearly defined leadoff and No. 2 hitters, for the leadoff hitter to tip off the batter that he is about to run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“After a while, I didn't like it,” Reyes said. “I started telling the hitters: ‘You do your thing, I don't want to get in the middle of your game. If you see me going, you might want to take the pitch but I'm not going to tell you that.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What if I get a bad jump, and it's a fastball down the middle? Nobody's helped, then. So I tell them that I do my thing and they should do theirs – if you want to swing at the first pitch, do it. Second pitch? Do it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gibbons could not have been clearer through the first week of spring training: The deciding factor in whether relievers Casey Janssen or Sergio Santos close, or Brett Cecil makes the bullpen, or Maicer Izturis or Bonifacio start at second base – heck, whether incumbent J.P. Arencibia is behind the plate to catch R.A Dickey on opening day (instead of Henry Blanco or Josh Thole) – will be whatever maximizes the chance to win.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gibbons will manage each inning with that goal in mind, too, and give varying degrees of rope to various players. But when it comes to running, Reyes will be on his own.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's probably a good thing that Hilary Mantel opened her mouth and made a speech about Kate Middleton getting knocked up and such matters. It gave everybody – simply everybody – something to pontificate about for days and days. Much easier to opine about the Royals and the media than getting acquainted with some of the real horror in the world today.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Events surrounding the athlete Oscar Pistorius in South Africa and the fatal shooting of his girlfriend are another distraction. Lurid, strange and compelling, the story offers so many opportunities for opinions to be meted out about the worship of athletes. Again, it is easier to focus on that story than it is to dwell on the mundane horror of war, of countries experiencing deeply traumatic and bloody conflict. And by that I mean Syria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Syria: Behind Rebel Lines (CBC, 9 p.m on Doc Zone ) is a rare look inside Syria as it is now. It's a fine piece of journalism rather than a carefully crafted documentary with a forged story arc. And because of that, it is all the more galvanizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the reporting is done by veteran Time magazine correspondent Rania Abouzeid and directed by Sylvene Gilchrist, and it is deeply sobering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It opens in a small town in northern Syria, one that has been destroyed and, as is pointed out to us, is largely devoid of civilians. Almost two years since protests unleashed the first stirrings of a civil war in Syria, the war grinds on in places such as this – remote, barren, ruined. We are introduced to a man in the Free Syrian Army, alone in manning a sniper position by an olive grove. Where once there were families, farmers and businesses, now the only activity is a brutal game of cat and mouse between the rebels and the forces of the regime. We also meet a man who worked in a clothing store in Damascus but returned to his home area when the trouble started. Now he's a fighter and takes a pessimistic view of the future. “All will be accountable,” he says darkly, meaning that if and when the regime falls, there will be more bloodshed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rania Abouzeid tells us, “There is chaos in the Syrian civil war.” She says there are shadowy groups of foreign fighters in the country and “criminal elements” who engage in kidnapping for ransom, looting homes and taking every advantage of the lawlessness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With two million people displaced and thousands fleeing every week, the chaos has allowed warlords to emerge, but we are told that the current political situation is “like a marketplace.” That is, people can pick and choose their allegiance from the elements among the rebel forces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She meets a group of men she describes as “Islamists who want an Islamic state.” Their leader is a charismatic figure who had left Syria for Italy and returned when the Hosni Mubarek regime fell in Egypt. He believed the Assad regime would fall next. A former champion discus-thrower, he's now battle-hardened, claiming to have dozens of pieces of shrapnel in his body, and he has a broken jaw.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the camera he says, “Yes we are mujahedeen, holy warriors until the fall of the regime. After the regime, everyone can display their wares. I want to stress this point. We will display our wares, not force them on anyone. The people will decide.” He also claims to be wary of foreign influences in Syria's future. “We started with a stick and a pump-action shotgun and we will return to the stick rather than allow anyone to force anything on us.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We meet a man, a former civil servant, who now makes rockets for the rebel forces. And we meet a female fighter with the rebels. The woman, who fights on the front line with an AK-47, says she tried to form a women's brigade, but other women weren't interested. An extraordinary figure, she has a personal message for Bashar al-Assad, the President of Syria – that's she is coming for him .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many vignettes that make the program interesting . But the overall portrait is what makes it memorable and a formidable act of reporting. The war in Syria goes on and on, in bleak outposts where the regime hangs on, having laid waste to the area; on stretches of highway that are controlled by one side, then another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's appalling, grim and yet it isn't unknowable, thanks to this act of bearing witness and reporting back. Even as so much else is distracting and lurid, it's better to be aware of the chilly, austere awfulness that unfolds in other places.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most harrowing thing I do every day here at home in South Africa is to drive 10 minutes to my two daughters' school.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't a possible hijacking I fear. It's words.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You see, we have newspaper posters here, tied to streetlight poles, advertising the big stories to lure readers. Tuesday was another horrific day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Why TV Star Klapped [slapped] Her!” screamed the Daily Sun tabloid's poster. Its more upmarket cousin, the Sowetan, offered: “Boys Forced To Have Sex: Attempted Rape Avenged With Rape.” Another was about Oscar Pistorius, the Paralympic hero charged with murder in the death of his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp: “Oscar's Gun Wishlist.” The story listed six firearm licences Mr. Pistorius had applied for, with a graphic of his face, three shotguns, a rifle and two handguns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this stared out at me and my two young girls, one of whom is a fluent reader. To avoid this assault, I have begun tuning the radio to music stations and steering discussion toward wildlife.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a country at war with its women. The <span class="companylink">African National Congress</span>'s Women's League is picketing against “the high rate of femicide in South Africa” at Mr. Pistorius's trial, and the term, with its intimations of murder on a vast scale, is about right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naeemah Abrahams, a senior researcher at the <span class="companylink">South African Medical Research Council</span>, told SAfm radio that between 1999 and 2009, the country's female homicide rate was five times higher than the global rate. On average, a woman is raped every four minutes and a woman is killed every eight hours by a partner or relative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, despite the voices highlighting the problem, nothing much is done. Every few months, a horrific incident occurs and the issue is suddenly front and centre. Politicians turn up at the victim's house and cameras flash. Then everyone goes about their business. We treat these horrific cases as rarities, but the truth is that the rape and murder of women is commonplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following the Pistorius case, South Africa is once again up in arms about the murder and rape of women, and once again, nothing much is being done. Mere hours after Ms. Steenkamp was killed, President Jacob Zuma – a man given to calling his main opposition opponent in Parliament “little girl” – delivered his State of the Nation speech. He decried violence against women. Then he announced drastic measures to clamp down on workers and communities protesting against lack of services. There were no serious new measures to fight gender-based violence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Africa is crying out for a real conversation. Few discuss the fact that a solution must begin with a discussion of how South Africans raise their young boys and men: Traditional roles are calcified, bullying is rampant in schools, a macho culture that glorifies gun ownership prevails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are always explanations about why South African men rape. Many blame the apartheid regime and how it allegedly dehumanized and humiliated black men. Others blame poverty. We wallow in analysis and do nothing while the body count rises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In my view, there is something we can do, though. South African can look at the facts, we can look at ourselves and we can acknowledge that we have a problem. Men need to talk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, that isn't happening. I have written elsewhere and I will repeat it today: We need a state of emergency. We need a concerted push to sit men down in communities, in schools, in workplaces, and make them acknowledge that they know co-workers, acquaintances and friends who rape. Studies have showed that some 28 per cent of men in South Africa have admitted to rape. Who are their friends?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is we who who walk away, who keep quiet, who say nothing even as the cries of women in our homes and neighbourhoods fill the nights. The answer lies with South Africa's men. Just as the HIV-AIDS pandemic is being defeated here through concerted and steady education, so too can we teach our men to be empathetic and human. Otherwise our children – boys and girls – have no future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If South Africa doesn't break the pattern, now, I fear our children's pain will not just come from what they read in newspaper posters. Our children's pain will come from being the real victims.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, we watched one of Canada's leading sportscasters stand before 18,000 high-school students at Toronto's Air Canada Centre and say, “I suffer from depression.” The courage it took for TSN's Michael Landsberg to publicly discuss his mental health struggles inspires us. While <span class="companylink">Bell Canada</span>'s “Let's Talk” campaign received almost 100 million calls, texts and social media hits last week, a study found almost half of Canadians surveyed believed that mental illness is “just an excuse for poor behaviour.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than six million Canadians face mental illness. So how do we support those who suffer in silence to one day be able to say, as Michael Landsberg did on that Toronto stage, “… I'm not embarrassed about it at all”?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experts</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We must appreciate the resilience of the many individuals who suffer mental illness but continue to contribute in meaningful ways to the diversity of our society, and to openly celebrate their contributions.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The readers</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– Paulette Dufort</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Get rid of wait lists. Based on my experience, people are more likely to come forward if they know they will get the help they need in a timely manner.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The soft-propaganda program, marching in lockstep with a gunfight against terrorism, has changed our perception of the agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new stereotype has emerged: The <span class="companylink">CIA</span> is neither an idiot nor a sinister killer, and its agents are no longer thin-lipped Machiavellian spooks, pulling the strings of international intrigue. They are struggling men and women, making personal sacrifices to fight the war on the shape-shifting monster called terrorism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The typically reticent <span class="companylink">CIA</span> showed up relatively late to the Hollywood party, in the 1990s. The <span class="companylink">Federal Bureau of Investigation</span> had been managing its image in popular media since the 1930s (1936's G-Men, and the TV series The F.B.I.) , and the Department of Defence started Hollywood outreach in 1947, with the Pentagon offering support to such rah-rah films as Patton, Top Gun and Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the post-Cold War period was a tough time for the <span class="companylink">CIA</span>, which was undergoing downsizing, criticism from Congress and questions about its competency. Hollywood had not been a traditional ally. Films from Three Days of the Condor (1975) to JFK (1991) typically showed the agency as either sinister, incompetent or both. Professor Tricia Jenkins, author of The <span class="companylink">CIA</span> in Hollywood: How the Agency Shapes Film and Television (2012), categorized the negative stereotypes into three categories, “rogues, assassins and buffoons.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1996, the <span class="companylink">CIA</span> appointed its first Hollywood liaison officer, Chase Brandon (a first cousin to Tommy Lee Jones), to turn that image around. What could the agency offer? Not tanks and fighter jets like the Pentagon. But they could provide script advice, access to real spies, story ideas and an aura of authenticity. The agency started consulting on movies such as Enemy of the State (1998), The Sum of All Fears (2002) and The Recruit (2003) and television shows such as The Agency, Alias and 24 (in the fall of 2001, coincident with the 9/11 attacks).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The movie-friendly approach worked. Even in the wake of the intelligence failures of 9/11 and the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, the controversies over renditions and waterboarding, the agency's representation on film and television has generally been more positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">CIA</span> does not have final say over the final film, but the agency won't help filmmakers if it finds a script unflattering, as in the cases of Spy Game (2001) or The Bourne Identity (2002). The benefits aren't just about sending a message of competence, ingenuity and intimidating technology (“Terrorists watch TV, too,” Brandon told one producer). TV shows and movies are also regarded as recruitment tools, especially as the agency, which was criticized in the 9/11 Commission Report for a lack of diversity, reaches out to women and minorities: Jennifer Garner, star of Alias, and later Ben Affleck's wife, did a recruitment video for the agency in 2004, which was posted on the <span class="companylink">CIA</span> website and used at college employment fairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, not all spy movies are officially approved. Retired <span class="companylink">CIA</span> agents are also consulted on movies that cast the agency in a bad light, such as 2005's Syriana, based on former agent Robert Baer's memoir, See No Evil. Another retired agent, Milton Bearden, was a key player in The Good Shepherd, an unflattering history of the agency from its inception to the failure of the Bay of Pigs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency doesn't seem to hold grudges, or miss a PR opportunity. George Clooney, who produced and starred in Syriana, also directed Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002), based on the memoir of Gong Show host Chuck Barris, who claimed in his memoir that he was an assassin for the <span class="companylink">CIA</span>. Clooney also starred in The Men Who Stare At Goats (2009), directed by his friend and producing partner, Grant Heslov, about the intelligence community's ridiculous mind-control experiments. Both Clooney and Heslov are in line to win best picture Oscars as producers on Argo, which was given <span class="companylink">CIA</span> co-operation and access to shoot at the agency's Langley, Va., headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In The Recruit, Al Pacino tells a young apprentice that the public knows only the <span class="companylink">CIA</span>'s failures, not its successes, but that has changed. Credit the agency with one of the greatest successful stealth missions ever perpetuated on the moviegoing public: It has made the <span class="companylink">CIA</span> seem human.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been a lot of loose talk of late about the United States becoming “energy independent” by decade's end. A more accurate prediction is that North America may become more energy independent in that time as the result of developments under way in both Canada and the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the U.S. consumes 15 million barrels of crude oil a day and imports eight to nine million, more than half of what it needs. The <span class="companylink">U.S. Energy Information Administration</span> forecast in 2012 that the U.S. will continue to import 7.5 million barrels a day into 2035.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada currently exports about 2.2 million barrels of crude oil a day to the U.S., an amount that could easily double if additional pipeline capacity were available. Now, there is little spare capacity, which is why some shippers are turning to rail. This limited pipeline capacity contributes to the sharply discounted price ($30 a barrel) for Canadian crude, a discount that negates some $6-billion in taxes and royalties annually for the Alberta treasury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deposits in Texas will compete with light, sweet crude from the Bakken region in North Dakota but not with Canadian heavy crude oil. Gulf Coast refineries, which would receive crude oil through the Keystone XL pipeline, prefer Canadian heavy oil because they are set up to run on heavy crude (today mainly from Venezuela) and cannot easily or economically switch to new light oil. And the relative longevity of a predictable oil sands supply versus shorter-lived shale plays further underscores that preference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimates about the future may vary, but all analyses confirm that world energy demand, particularly for oil, will grow for the next 20 years and that the U.S. will continue to use more fossil fuels and import several million barrels of crude oil each and every day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So if oil is not shipped in increasing quantities by pipeline from secure, stable Canada, the U.S. will be obliged to rely on crude oil from more volatile Middle Eastern and South American suppliers who share neither American interests nor values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under NAFTA, Canada provided security of oil supply to the U.S., including supply on a pro rata basis in times of shortage, in exchange for security of demand. No other oil supplier has made a similar commitment to the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also much confusion between fact and fiction surrounding the greenhouse gas (GHG) contribution of oil sands production. For one thing, crude oil shipped to U.S. refineries from Canada via Keystone XL would displace heavy oil from Venezuela with similar carbon content. For another, on a life-cycle basis, the oil sands industry has already reduced GHG emissions per barrel by 26 per cent since 1990, and technology will enable further progress in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite prattle that we should do “more” about climate change, Canada is the only supplier of oil to the U.S. market that is aligned with the U.S. on GHG emissions and has similar approaches to oversight and transparency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil sands emissions currently constitute 0.1 per cent of global GHG emissions. The 48 million tonnes of emissions from the oil sands in 2012 are less than 3 per cent of the emissions from U.S. coal-fired plants, which account for two billion tonnes of GHG emissions annually and are expected to increase by a third by 2025. Some U.S. rhetoric on the subject of climate change often ignores this inconvenient truth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often forgotten is that more than 70 per cent of GHG emissions occur during fuel consumption – regardless of the source of the crude oil. But Keystone XL would offset as many as 200 ocean tankers a year, reducing GHG emissions by as much as 19 million tonnes. According to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of State</span>'s Environmental Impact Study, the use of trains to move crude oil produces more than triple the GHG emissions of a pipeline. There have even been shipments by barge down the Mississippi River!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most important fact of all is that by adding new pipeline capacity to our East and West coasts, as well as to the U.S., Canada can not only help bring North America closer to energy independence but also have more than a single market for crude oil exports. Without additional pipeline capacity in and from Canada, energy independence will remain illusory and Canada's valuable resource will remain landlocked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the East Coast options for the transmission of western crude to Quebec and Saint John materialize, Canadian consumers will be able to wean themselves from foreign imports entirely. (Canada currently imports about 600,000 barrels a day from suppliers such as Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Angola at substantially higher costs.) An added bonus would be that the deep discount for Canadian crude oil, due largely to limitations of existing pipeline capacity and absence of pipeline approvals, will disappear. Regrettably, the combination of insufficient pipeline capacity, deeply discounted prices in Western Canada and high supply costs in Eastern Canada reduces economic activity across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Approving Keystone and the East and West coast options for pipelines can reduce both Canadian and U.S. vulnerability to the vagaries of more volatile markets. Because opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline is essentially intended to stop production from the oil sands, the smartest move Canada can make is to endorse and start to build pipelines that will enable us to diversify oil exports beyond the U.S. market. That would inject a degree of leverage into the debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Above all, we need a balanced approach, based on fact, not fiction, that recognizes the importance of economic growth and environmental stability, not a false choice between the two.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Brunswick governments have suffered from oil and gas envy. A bit grumpily, they watched offshore oil pour revenues into Newfoundland and saw Nova Scotia reap the benefits of offshore natural gas.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Times are tough, which makes the envy a bit deeper. The province has suffered two credit downgrades. It's running a large fiscal deficit and has a big debt burden. Unemployment is stubbornly high; Ottawa's changes to EI eligibility for seasonal workers are unpopular. Many have headed to Alberta to work in oil and gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could it be, however, that oil and natural gas might lift New Brunswick itself from its doldrums, at least partially? Not for a while. But perhaps within a decade, oil and gas may be running through the province to Saint John, bringing jobs, revenues and even spinoff industries .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's the dream scenario: Alberta's bitumen oil is being increasingly harried; pipelines through British Columbia face considerable opposition; the Keystone XL pipeline to the Gulf of Mexico is uncertain, owing to the vagaries of U.S. politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one direction where western oil can flow with the fewest political obstacles is east – to Ontario (for refining in Sarnia), Quebec (Montreal and Quebec City) and Saint John, with a refinery and a deep-water port for year-round shipping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All three major political parties in New Brunswick support a pipeline from Quebec City to Saint John. So do the Harper Conservatives, provided a business case can be made. Even the federal New Democrats are nominally in favour. With those ducks lined up, no wonder New Brunswickers allow themselves to dream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But wait. Between dream and reality lies Quebec. There, “national interest” means what's in it for Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec has ripped off Newfoundland over Labarador hydro for decades, refusing to reopen any part of an egregiously unfair deal signed when hydroelectric rates were a tiny fraction of what they became. <span class="companylink">Hydro-Québec</span>'s takeover plans for New Brunswick's electrical utility died on the hill of ferocious local opposition in the smaller province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No pipeline can reach New Brunswick until a line is allowed from Quebec City to the border. In theory (and law), a decision on interprovincial matters lies with Ottawa; in practice, no federal government would defy Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Brunswick's hope is that the lure of shipping oil all the way to New Brunswick will make the Alberta industry more interested in reversing one pipeline and building another to supply the refineries in Montreal and Quebec City. More oil could then be sent to Saint John. Alberta oil would be cheaper than offshore supplies for Quebec and not subject to interruptions or price spikes as the result of international crises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Brunswick Premier David Alward has met with Quebec's Pauline Marois, who promised to study the matter from the unique perspective of Quebec's interests – and of her cabinet and caucus dynamics, where voices inveigh against oil in general and Alberta's “dirty” bitumen oil in particular. Mr. Alward has clear political sailing in his province. Not so Ms. Marois in her own party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there's shale gas. Four companies are working on it in New Brunswick. Early estimates suggest large quantities. Environmental questions need answers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Brunswick sits in a geographic sweet spot. A gas pipeline runs to the United States from Nova Scotia. Saint John, with its deep-water port, would be perfect for a liquefied natural gas terminal site. Shale gas for the U.S. (assuming a market exists, what with the discoveries of shale gas there). Liquefied natural gas for foreign markets. Jobs and money for New Brunswick. Maybe there could be petrochemical production, too. And just maybe, fertilizer plants using the province's potash and shale gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is all to dream. In the province that gave the world the Bricklin car, dreams have had a way of going awry. But these ones are not so easily mocked.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pre-Oscars red carpet viewing can add two, even three hours of rubbernecking to an already cruelly long night. In exchange, we get preening and posing and actors pulled between interviewers like circus animals on invisible leashes. Occasionally, the red carpet yields an unscripted moment of delightful weirdness – inevitably involving Gary Busey – but the exercise has become so carefully orchestrated that reporters don't ask actual questions, except for the accidental uptalk: “You look amazing?” Ultimately, the red carpet becomes the Home Shopping Channel, where female celebrities – no one cares that Armani makes your suit, George – name-check designers in exchange for handbags and loaned diamonds.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the comfort of our couches, the red carpet is equal parts boring and intoxicating, but is it bad for women? For their efforts, the actresses will be pilloried, compared and contrasted, forced into rivalries by bloggers and reporters citing dresses that are less ugly or more lame than some other starlet's. It all seems like harmless fun, but it may be that the red carpet – and our fascination with off-carpet feuds – perpetuates the enduring, absurd idea that women hate women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rivalry is the raison d'être of the awards season, but for female celebrities, reports quickly segue from professional competition to cat fight. Occasionally, the animosity is real (Joan Crawford did diss Bette Davis's dress when the latter won an Oscar for Dangerous), but most is manufactured (Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Lopez presented an award together last year to defuse rumours of backstabbing).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, the alleged girl-on-girl hostility is between best actress nominees Jessica Chastain and Jennifer Lawrence. After Lawrence made a mild joke at Chastain's expense on Saturday Night Live, gossip site Showbiz Spy reported a source who said: “Jessica can't stand the fact that Jennifer is stealing her thunder!” The faux-questioning headline read: “Jessica Chastain Hates Jennifer Lawrence?” As each collected trophies at various ceremonies, their alleged sniping made news around the globe, reported from Ireland to India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Impressively, Chastain confronted the rumours head-on. On her <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page, she complimented Lawrence and asked: “Why do we support the myth that women are competitive and cannot get along?” She wrote that she had never fielded more questions about behind-the-scenes bickering than when she made The Help, a movie featuring a nearly all-female cast, ergo: cat fight!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leora Tanenbaum's book Catfight notes that describing a woman with the word “cat” dates back to the 1600s (it was also slang for vulva), but the phrase “cat fight” – petty, titillating and jealous lady battles – didn't get much use until the 1970s. The word is almost never applied to men: When Chris Brown didn't rise from his seat after Frank Ocean won a Grammy last month, the moment was noted in the media as graceless, but no one made a “Meow!” sound and waved claw hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Cat fight” trivializes relationships between women, reducing female competition to a giggling, sexually charged spectacle. But it's ridiculous to assert that women take inherent pleasure in watching each other fail, or always resent one another's success. I've known and worked with too many supportive, generously spirited women, and far too many cutthroat, devious men, to believe that all women are one shove away from What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So who does it serve to stereotype women as rivals and enemies? American writer Susan J. Douglas documented how during the ERA movement in the United States in the 1970s, media and political opponents loved pitting feminist Gloria Steinem against conservative Phyllis Schlafly, distracting from the issue at hand, and even slowing down progress. Presenting women as emotional and furry makes it hard to take them seriously, and ensures the status quo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This isn't to deny that women receive warped messages about assertiveness. Too often, women learn early that to be overt about one's ambitions is unfeminine. A “good girl” isn't competitive, but selfless. If Jessica Chastain wants Jennifer Lawrence to lose, that makes her a bitch. If Joaquin Phoenix wants Daniel Day-Lewis to lose, that makes him human.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition is about scarcity of resources: The faux-rivalry between Chastain and Lawrence is a version of the “2 Stars 1 Slot” game that originated on the now-defunct website Fametracker. It's as if there couldn't possibly be enough room in Hollywood for two talented, beautiful, breakout actresses with the first initial J, so one must eat the other, like a hamster mom. Unequal access to power drives competition between women in workplaces, too: If many industries and professions are still dominated by men, women may view other women as rivals for fewer spaces, fair or not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this perception doesn't help redress inequalities; women championing and mentoring other women might. At the risk of sounding a touch Kumbaya, women should be helping each other along, not pulling each other down – and they do, regularly. Unfortunately, women-helping-women is a less appetizing pop-culture trope than “cat fight.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So despite the temptation, I'm going to resist the red carpet this year, where accomplished women are set against each other for entertainment. Unlike the young actresses trying to forge their careers, at least I have the option to turn it off.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The horrific and deadly gang rape of a 23-year-old student in Delhi last December, and the shooting of model Reeva Steenkamp in Pretoria on Valentine's Day have brought to the fore the issue of sexual violence and the particular dangers women face. Ms. Steenkamp's boyfriend, Oscar Pistorius, a double-amputee and celebrity Olympian, has been charged with murder.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both countries are having to confront the public's anger over alarmingly high levels of violence against women and the deeply ingrained societal biases against women that the two tragedies have highlighted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India is to be commended, then, for acting quickly to bring in a new law toughening the penalties for rape, and making stalking, acid attacks and the trafficking of women and children crimes. The legislation reflects the expectation that the state must do a better job protecting women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a defining moment for India, as it rolls out public-outreach and engagement programs, including training police in how to investigate rapes, in the hope that certain behaviours that have long been tolerated, such as groping women on public transport, will change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Africa should likewise channel its outrage over the murder of Ms. Steenkamp into political action. The rate of homicides of females in that country is extremely high – five times higher than the global rate, according to the <span class="companylink">South African Medical Research Council</span>. One-quarter of men have raped a woman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country must find new ways to bring up and educate boys and young men, so that they no longer grow up thinking violence against women is acceptable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as India has been spurred to action, South Africa must use the tragedy to push for transformation, and to finally tackle the root cause of endemic gender-based violence and challenge a deeply chauvinistic culture.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My daughter is in a serious relationship with a gentleman who is 13 years her senior. She thinks marriage is in their future and is expecting him to ask me for permission to marry her. What questions might I ask him to best demonstrate he is a man who deserves my daughter?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, first of all, be happy that he wants to “ask your permission” before marrying your daughter. Old school! Maybe it helps he's a bit older, and not part of the millennial hook-up culture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Writer Kate Bolick recently created quite a stir with an Atlantic article declaring the reason she hadn't married yet, at the age of 39, was because modern men are either “deadbeats” or “playboys.” The saddest part of the article, to me, was when she described a group of women who were recent college graduates. She says that “these denizens of hook-up culture were far more experienced than I'd been at their age,” and at first “they all joked easily about sexual positions and penis size … with the offhand knowledge only familiarity can breed.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when Ms. Bolick asked them how they felt about the prospect of being single into their 30s, like her, there was a long pause, then: “‘I don't think I can bear doing this that long,' one of them said, with undisguised alarm.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not saying everybody should get married. But I am a fan of the institution (smartest thing I ever did), and I think it's cause for celebration that your daughter has found someone she wants to marry, who wants to marry her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I mean, sure, sit the guy down, have a beer and some pretzels, and get to know him. In your shoes I'd be curious to know a) what his plans are for the future, b) what it is that he loves about your daughter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that the specifics matter so much: What you're looking for in both cases is passion. My own father-in-law, never sat me down like that – though he could have. I was braced for it: After all, he comes from a generation, raised in the shadow of the Depression, lived through a world war, that valued economic stability above all else. And here was his daughter marrying this … writer?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If he had, I could have delivered a soliloquy that would have singed his eyebrows. I had it all ready. It begins: “Well, Wilson, let me tell you, first of all: I'd gladly take a bullet for your daughter, any day of the week – okay, maybe gladly is a stretch, but if someone were to pull a gun on her, would I jump in front? In a heartbeat. And as I slid down the wall, leaving a bloody track, I'd smile quietly to myself, knowing I'd done the right thing …”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then I'd explain my burning ambitions to claw my way to the top of the writing game, in order to provide a happy life for his daughter and future grandchildren, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So look for a bit of that in your prospective son-in-law. What a career needs at the beginning is purpose and ambition; what a relationship needs is momentum. Conversely, the father-in-law/son-in-law relationship is one best eased into, like a hot tub. So steer clear of any formal inquisition this early on. He's much more likely to open up to you that way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I wouldn't worry too much about whether he “deserves” her or not. I mean, what man in the history of humanity has ever deserved the woman he's with? Did you deserve the mother of your daughter? Better if he doesn't deserve her and knows it. That way, he'll spend a lifetime trying to impress her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, a couple of other things I think are important in the early going are: good impulse control and that he loves her for her faults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you detect poor impulse control, then you have my permission to speak to your daughter in the most strenuous terms. Otherwise, I would just, tactfully, with great caution and circumlocution – remember, it's an IED-filled road to go down, criticizing someone's fiancé! – share your findings with your daughter, but take it no further than that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because what's all this about “permission” anyway, and who says she needs it or will abide by your ruling? Even if she were such a dutiful daughter that she called off her wedding because you withheld your “permission,” then who's the one not “respecting her needs” and “nurturing her ability to be independent?”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Political sociologist at the University of Lethbridge and director of the Parkland Institute, an Alberta think tank</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent statements by federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty that the government's budget plans have been thrown into disarray by a decline in Alberta's oil revenues should come as no surprise. The differential between the North American benchmark price for crude and the price Alberta gets for its thicker brand of oil has been played up in recent months by the provincial Progressive Conservative government as a major cause of its fiscal woes. Now its federal counterpart is using the same argument to explain its declining revenues.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly the differential rate is part of the story for both governments. And complaints of insufficient pipeline access to new markets hold some merit. But the differential rate is not something new, and the idea that more pipelines would solve Alberta's and Canada's growing revenue problems is, one might say, a pipe dream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bigger, more important story is the narrowing of Canada's economy in the interest of petroleum development. Historically, Alberta's economy has been the most unstable in all of Canada, but the volatility was largely confined to its own borders. Today, aided and abetted by the federal government, Alberta has exported its instability to the rest of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those familiar with the tenets of staples theory will recognize the pattern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pioneered by Canadian economist Harold Innis, staples theory emphasized the dilemmas associated with single-resource production. When the world price of a commodity is high, the allure of riches can be so great that people throw all of their effort and money into riding the resource boom. But the price of staples is unstable, subject to, among other things, over-production, replacement technologies, the vagaries of climate, transportation glitches and even fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as the price of a staple commodity can rise quickly, it can drop, bringing economic, social and political ruin. Canada's landscape is dotted with this story, from towns (Uranium City) to regions and provinces (Newfoundland and cod). Sometimes, of course, the good times return, but often they don't. In any case, the result is growing economic and political dependency, what Innis referred to as the “staples trap” – easy to get into, hard to get out of. That's where Alberta and Canada find themselves now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Stephen Harper is on record as declaring Canada an emerging energy superpower. The efforts his government has made to promote this vision – the passing of omnibus legislation to eliminate perceived roadblocks to oil development, the politically motivated attacks on individuals and organizations who oppose further petroleum expansion – have been unprecedented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Far from being a superpower, however, Canada increasingly looks like a hundred-pound weakling, a single-resource producer, buffeted by pricing over which we have no control, technological innovations that portend a reduction in the value of oil and environmental issues that threaten all of us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Montreal's fur trade magnates 200 years ago, who suddenly found that the market for beaver pelts had disappeared, we find ourselves today sending emissaries here, there and everywhere, pleading, begging and cajoling others to save us from the fate unfolding before our eyes. But, as Shakespeare said, the fault lies not in the stars, but in ourselves – and the governments we have elected, which too eagerly have opened the doors leading to the petroleum trap.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is laughable that the <span class="companylink">Office québécois de la langue française</span> would go after an Italian restaurant for having a few Italian words on its otherwise all-French menu. It is even more absurd that the Parti Québécois government of Pauline Marois has distanced itself from the incident, calling it a case of overzealousness. The PQ has been pushing divisive language buttons since the election last fall; that is why the word “pasta” is in the crosshairs of language inspectors.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buonanotte (which means bonne nuit) is a trendy Italian bar and restaurant that sees its share of NHL hockey players and politicians at its linened tables. The menu is mostly in French, as required by law, but Italian words like polpette (meatballs), calamari (squid) and pasta (pasta) were left in. For most French-speaking Quebeckers, those Italian words are as inoffensive as the name Gionta on the jersey of the well-loved captain of the Montreal Canadiens hockey team. But to the OQLF, they are a blight on the French language.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PQ cabinet ministers laughed off the incident. The OQLF has since backed off, saying it would take into account the peculiarities of an Italian restaurant serving Italian dishes. But can the OQLF be blamed for its hypervigilance, given the atmosphere created by the PQ? One of the government's first acts was to propose a law to make it easier to register complaints about being served bilingually (not in French only) in a store or restaurant; Mme. Marois called on Quebeckers to be “sentinels of the language” and report alleged abuses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The small town of Ste-Agathe-des-Monts was ordered to stop including a page of English information in its municipal newsletter. It was a move that angered the town's French-speaking mayor and many of its francophone residents, but which was left to fester by the PQ. Another town with even deeper English roots, Lac-Brome, is now being threatened with the loss of its bilingual status because its anglophone population may have fallen below the 50-per-cent benchmark required to be blessed with the right to sell “pasta.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec's contentious language laws and the institutions overseeing them are important to French-speaking Quebeckers. But when a new government begins its mandate by encouraging Quebeckers to snitch on each other, and refuses to show flexibility where it is clearly warranted, then you end up with the ridiculous sight of inspectors asking for the removal of the word “pasta” from Italian menus. If the OQLF is a laughingstock today, it has the PQ government to thank for that.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why can't you ever get begrudging acceptance?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contrary to most opinions, the refusal to accept no is not an indication of budding character flaws. Children who object to not getting their way are not bad, they are just alive and possessed of speech. The normal response to not getting one's way is to be upset and to try to undo the current unpleasant state of affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Children today are not afraid of their parents. They do not worry about dire consequences for being a pest – there generally are none.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But your reason is stupid. Why can't you drive me to the store. There's plenty of time.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You do need to stop the debate. Don't even say: “I don't want to hear any more about it.” The truth is that any response to their objections will feed their non-acceptance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once you make your final decision, stick with your “no.” If you regularly follow this practice, they learn that they can fuss as much as they want, but it's not going to get them anything.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's a devoted fan of musical theatre, but Jim Buckshon never imagined himself a props master. The president of a music production company was merely looking for some new office space, when he wound up stumbling upon a whole new line of work. Not props master, really – but owner of the Vancouver Playhouse Theatre Company's enormous collection of props: chandeliers, bird cages, tea cups, skeletons, baby carriages, rows and rows of chairs.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Want to count? It's in the multiple 100s,” said Mr. Buckshon of those chairs, touring through the storage area on Friday, showing off the vintage typewriters, paper mâché turkeys, and stacks of vintage luggage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's probably enough suitcases to sink the Titanic.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Vancouver Playhouse Theatre Company shut down operations last March, a day after publicly announcing it could not continue. There was some hope of reigniting the 49-year-old regional theatre company, but on December 13, it disbanded. The board members resigned the following day. According to a note on the Playhouse website, the company is insolvent and cannot pay for bankruptcy proceedings. (Attempts to reach former board chair Jeff Schulz were not successful.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The props collection – amassed over many years, and an important asset to the theatre community – was almost a casualty of the financial mess. But Mr. Buckshon stepped in to save it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May 2011, he was looking for additional space for his company, Renegade Productions, and struck a deal to sublet space from the Playhouse at its East 2nd Avenue facility. Renegade would pay rent to the Playhouse, which would in turn pay the landlord. The two organizations got along beautifully.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Playhouse shut down, Mr. Buckshon was blindsided. He learned from its landlord, the Beedie Development Group, that the Playhouse hadn't been paying rent (which was already below market, according to Beedie) for “several months” – including Renegade's share. The Beedie Group asked Mr. Buckshon for proof that Renegade had been paying the Playhouse, he produced that proof, and was offered the lease for the entire building– including the scene shop, props department and wardrobe department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Playhouse had surrendered assets to the landlord for moneys owed, so the landlord was stuck with all the props (the Playhouse removed the wardrobe, according to Beedie). The Beedie Group offered the collection to at least three other theatrical enterprises, but nobody bought them – not because of the price (which Mr. Buckshon says was relatively low) but because of the cost of moving, cataloging and storing the collection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beedie offered the collection to Renegade, at, again, a relatively low price. Mr. Buckshon, knowing this was important and sensitive, sought the advice of now laid-off Playhouse employees. They not only encouraged him, some volunteered to sort through and move the collection to a different part of the facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renegade sold off some of the props to the theatre community and later to the general public – some of those chairs, old suitcases, figurines, coffins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We had five of them and we sold three,” Mr. Buckshon said of the coffins. “Because no one ever really takes more than two.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between the cost of buying the props, moving them, donating some, cleaning out the area and throwing out anything they couldn't use – five dumpsters full – Mr. Buckshon estimates it cost Renegade about $15,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well worth it, he said. By the time he was ready to rent them out, there was a lineup of B.C. companies who needed them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think it's tremendous what they're doing. They did take on a big load,” said Brian Heath, production manager for Gateway Theatre, which used Renegade for its production last year of Fiddler on the Roof. “I know that props is not a money-making venture.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Buckshon knows that, too. He's subsidizing the props and theatre operation – Renegade Arts Society – with his music operation, providing staff to run the props division for free, and subsidizing the rent and utilities. He also rents out rehearsal space to local theatre companies – the old scene shop has even been used as a black box theatre – and Renegade offers studio space to 14 visual artists where the wardrobe shop used to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he's building up the music side of the business: In the old Playhouse space, he's created some 50 rehearsal studios, used by local acts such as Dan Mangan, Hey Ocean, Said the Whale, Yukon Blonde and Hannah Georgas. He's building a recording studio in the basement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Mr. Buckshon is getting into theatre production, too, co-producing Stephen Sondheim's Assassins with Pipedream Theatre Project at Performance Works on Granville Island next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They were short on money and they knew we had theatre assets,” said Mr. Buckshon, who will partner with Fighting Chance Productions next season. “We're going to basically try to fill some of the vacuum in Vancouver theatre … that the Playhouse left.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's now working on photographing and cataloging the vast props collection – he figures there are at least 10,000 items – so he can get photos on line, where other theatre companies can access them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I would have made more money on other things, but I wanted to keep that collection intact,” he said. “It's something the theatre community needs and we're in a position to be able to do it. We love theatre and as long as we're not losing a bundle on it, we'll keep it going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All's well that ends well.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Bennett will be the first Canadian ambassador posted to Canadians.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Harper Conservatives' latest brainchild, an ambassador for religious freedom, is supposed to criticize other countries' lack of protection for religious minorities. These critiques will have zero effect on the intended targets, but they will be wildly popular with domestic religious groups, who are the real political targets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Promoting religious tolerance is, of course, a justifiable extension of Canadian values and, as such, a fit thrust of foreign policy. No believer in pluralism and the protection of human rights denies the need to protect religious beliefs. But as the Americans discovered when they established such an office, it had no influence anywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There exists a Department of Foreign Affairs that promotes human rights, including religious rights, as part of its mandate. It could be instructed to do more of this promotion. To imagine that an office with a $5-million budget will make a whit of difference overseas is to engage in the foreign policy of headlines and illusion rather than fact and substance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This $5-million fulfills a campaign promise by the Conservatives. It fits with the party's overall approach of extending political offerings longer on image than substance to parts of its core vote – in this case, dedicated religious believers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can be sure that the announcements from this new ambassador will feature prominently in the church groups in Canada that are the post's principal targets, to say nothing of Conservative MPs' household mailings in ridings where religiosity counts. It is guaranteed that the ambassador's various pronouncements will receive far more attention in these selected slices of Canada than in any of the countries targeted by him or the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newly created office will fit within a department whose guts are being ripped out by budget cuts. Almost $170-million is being removed from the department, according to the 2012 budget. Staff are being laid off, programs cancelled, visa application centres closed, residences sold, embassy budgets slashed – all by a government that brags that Canada has resumed a position of strength and respect overseas, whereas the opposite is largely true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this is how the Harper government does politics, and who can deny its success? There are gestures and policies directed at the heart of its base to fire up its enthusiasm for the Conservative cause, and these are accompanied by little targeted tax cuts and spending announcements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, Canadians saw another announcement typical of this approach: $10-million for defibrillators at hockey arenas and community centres. Why these places and not football and soccer fields or YMCAs and YMHAs or yoga studios? True, many people die of heart attacks and seizures, but not so many in hockey arenas to justify this cost. But hockey is dear to Mr. Harper's view of Canada, as are those who spend time in these arenas, especially the “hard-working Canadian families” he is always talking about and who are central to his vision of who votes for his party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are the <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> voters, not the chardonnay set of the central cities or the supposed beer-drinking men and women of the union movement. They are the bull's-eye for Conservative strategists, such that we might now call it the 3-H party: Harper, hockey and Hortons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $10-million for the defibrillators, like the money Mr. Harper recently announced for the ferry at Lévis, Que., and the millions he sprinkles almost everywhere he makes “announcements,” is at one with what happens every week the Commons is not sitting: A bevy of Conservative ministers shower money across the country – at the very time when budgets of line departments are being cut, $5-billion is being removed from government spending with warnings that more might be needed, programs are being eliminated and Canadians are being warned they are carrying too much debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the politics of slice and dice, of small ball as they say in baseball, of saying one thing but doing another, of preaching restraint while practising the imperative of targeted spending at portions of the electorate central to the Conservatives' core.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the game's new patron saint of second chances, it is no surprise that R.A. Dickey would relate easily to John Gibbons.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Dickey's mind, some of that owed to the natural affinity of Southerners – he from Nashville, Gibbons from San Antonio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Similar cultures, they made for an instant connection,” said the knuckleballer who won the National League Cy Young Award last season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is also possible, Dickey said, that as someone who received a third, fourth and fifth chance after being a ballyhooed first-round draft pick, he could relate to a manager getting the rarest of second chances: being rehired by the same team that fired him, and not after an entirely successful first stint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dickey says that until he had a chance to talk to Gibbons when the <span class="companylink">Toronto Blue Jays</span>' brain trust visited him in Nashville to pitch a contract extension, all he knew about the manager was “he was the guy that had a confrontation on the mound that one time with Ted Lilly.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Which,” Dickey added, “is probably what most people knew about John.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Blue Jays will open their Grapefruit League schedule Saturday in Lakeland, Fla., against the <span class="companylink">Detroit Tigers</span>, and if Gibbons has changed from the guy who was fired as Blue Jays manager in 2008, it is not detectable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is not the first manager to be given a second chance by the same team, of course. Billy Martin was on his sixth stint with the <span class="companylink">New York Yankees</span> when he passed away, but that doesn't mean the second chance is always a sideshow. Cito Gaston had two opportunities to manage the Blue Jays, including replacing Gibbons, but most people saw Gaston Redux as a convenient tying up of loose ends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gibbons was 305-305 in 41/2 seasons with the Blue Jays, finishing third twice as well as second and fifth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“To come back a second time to the same place?” Gibbons asked in response to a question about whether this was the ultimate second chance. “Oh yeah. I mean, if we'd won something the first time I could probably understand it – like Cito coming back here. I have a big responsibility here. We want to win, and Alex [Anthopoulos, the Blue Jays' general manager], well, he's stuck his neck out. I don't take that lightly.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dickey knows second chances. Drafted by the <span class="companylink">Texas Rangers</span> 18th overall in 1996, he appeared in 79 games for the Rangers, including 33 starts, between 2001 and 2006, but he became just another guy. In 2005, manager Buck Showalter and pitching coach Orel Hershiser suggested he start throwing a knuckleball, then gave him a shot as the No. 4 starter in 2006, a season that famously lasted one start in which he gave up six homers. But instead of throwing him overboard, Showalter and the Rangers let him go to the minors to refine the knuckleball. Do not underestimate the importance to an experimenting Dickey of structure provided by a familiar training and coaching staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I had a second, third, fourth and fifth chance in Texas,” Dickey said. “I spent seven years in the minors, came up, went down, and when Buck took over in 2003, he told me he believed in me. I was a conventional pitcher then, and when that petered out, they gave me a chance to be a knuckleballer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A lot of what people call second chances in this game are really just opportunities. I know I had a lot of opportunities that other minor-leaguers didn't get, but a lot of that depends on aptitude. What have you learned from your previous mistakes and experiences? Can you combine that with a work ethic that allows you to take advantage of the opportunity? Opportunity can come to a lot of guys who don't change, either. You can be stubborn, and there's always the chance that somebody will eventually come along and agree with you.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anthopoulos makes no secret about why Gibbons is receiving this second chance. He handles a bullpen well, and that is where a manager exercises the most influence on a game. Plus, Anthopoulos knows him. Anthopoulos was assistant GM under J.P. Ricciardi during Gibbons's first stint. Anthopoulos didn't know John Farrell and was, frankly, sold a bill of goods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I remember talking to a few GMs,” Anthopoulos said, “guys who have been around a while, guys I trust, and they all said they didn't think they'd hire somebody that they didn't know to some extent. I mean, these are people I respect. I asked about bringing Gibby back. They thought it would be great. Then they said: ‘Do you think Paul [Beeston, the Blue Jays' president and chief executive officer] will let you do it?'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between Blue Jays stints, Gibbons spent three years as a bench coach with the <span class="companylink">Kansas City Royals</span> and managed the <span class="companylink">San Diego Padres</span>' Double-A affiliate in San Antonio. He interviewed for managerial vacancies with the <span class="companylink">Seattle Mariners</span> (Eric Wedge got the job) and <span class="companylink">Pittsburgh Pirates</span>, pulling out of the process after making the short list, suspecting that his minor-league teammate, Clint Hurdle, would get the job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ricciardi, now with the <span class="companylink">New York Mets</span>, suggested he apply for that team's manager job. Gibbons declined, and admits he has been surprised at how positively his rehiring was greeted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I know I came to be defined by those run-ins with Ted [Lilly] and Shea [Hillenbrand] and that's fine,” Gibbons said. “That's fair. When a team's not winning, everything goes under the microscope. I'm still going to do things the best way I know how. I'm not a politically correct guy, I won't do things just to be popular. But at the same time, I don't just want to survive as a manager. I want to be successful.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can the Oscars tell us who we are? Let's say you still believe that cinema is an art form, that one of its delights is that it holds up a mirror to its viewers' situations and preoccupations, and that the Academy's best-picture nominees (more or less) represent the spectrum of quality movies of any given year. If so – all big ifs, but stick with me – then the current list tells me this: Ordinary lives don't interest North American moviegoers much right now.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the nine nominees for best picture, only two delve into what most of us would recognize as our day-to-day existence of families, jobs and human-scale conundrums – Amour and Silver Linings Playbook – and one of those is from France. The rest of the list depicts high-intensity situations: either wars, revolutions and crises (Argo, Django Unchained, Les Misérables, Lincoln, Zero Dark Thirty) or apocalyptic fables (Beasts of the Southern Wild, Life of Pi).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's this perception that the Oscars favour biopics and historical dramas, stuff with sweep and Sturm und Drang, and that's true. But a quick scan of the nominees since 1970 shows that, even when there were only five best-picture contenders, there was plenty of room for movies about regular folks dealing with recognizable issues; one of them was actually called Ordinary People. Five Easy Pieces, Annie Hall, An Unmarried Woman, Kramer vs. Kramer, Atlantic City, Tootsie, The Big Chill, Terms of Endearment, Broadcast News, Moonstruck, Working Girl, Jerry Maguire, Good Will Hunting, Lost in Translation, Little Miss Sunshine, Juno, The Kids Are All Right, Up in the Air – best-picture nominees all, they featured people you might know, who were dealing with the same things you were: the vagaries of friendship; falling in or out of love; dissatisfactions at work; divorce; disease; angst; hope; and eventually (almost a given in American films) redemption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silver Linings Playbook is this year's only English-language best-picture nominee to uphold that tradition. That's weird to me. And what's even weirder is, I can't think of many other regular-folk movies of 2012 that should be on the best-picture list. The films Flight, Moonrise Kingdom, The Sessions, The Master and The Impossible have been nominated in other categories. But that's about it as far as those human-scale films go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the risk of being a contrarian, I don't even think Silver Linings Playbook is a very good movie – it's too often quirky for quirky's sake, and its haphazard charms fall apart upon a second viewing. I think the only reason it's on the best-picture list, and has also been nominated in all four acting categories, as well as for directing, editing and writing, is that there's simply nothing else out there for the many, many Academy members who like this kind of thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is: Why not? Why is there such a dearth of this kind of nominee: the handsome, well-made exploration of everyday transcendence and transformation, which used to be Hollywood's bread and butter?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think the answer is: You can't nominate a movie that doesn't exist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we're seeing this year, to me, is the result of a practice that's been going on for a decade. The studios have pulled back from making mid-budget, A-list fare, mainly because they can't be guaranteed a return on their investment. They can't sum up these kinds of films in a line on the poster, or in a 140-character tweet. They're not a safe sell. So they're not making them like they used to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not all the studios' fault, however. We vote with our wallets, and in 2012 the top 13 films at the box office were Marvel's The Avengers, The Dark Knight Rises, The Hunger Games, Skyfall, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2, The Amazing Spider-Man, Brave, Ted, Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted, Dr. Seuss' The Lorax, Wreck-It Ralph and Men In Black 3. That is, comic-book movies, tentpoles, sequels, and kids' cartoons – the lone exception being Ted, which was about a foul-mouthed stuffed animal, also known as a marketer's wet dream. If we keep eating up this pap – in droves – they're sure going to keep feeding it to us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I find it much more interesting to ponder why we're indifferent to seeing our lives reflected back to us. Why do we prefer watching a girl fall in love with a vampire instead of with a regular dude? Why do we care about a guy in a superhero suit more than one in a business suit? Why do we flock to see how a teenager survives a fight to the death, and not to see how she handles regular high school? Why are we willing to examine the pain in our pasts but not in the present?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could it be that we're so de-sensitized that we need epic battles and massive body counts to keep us awake? Are our real lives so lacking in romance and excitement that human love and human-sized challenges don't do it for us any more? Are we so disconnected from one another that stories about people we could actually know can no longer hold our interest?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I hope not. I hope that this year's dearth of personal stories is merely a blip, and not a lasting trend. I hope that audiences, faced with the question that the title character poses at the end of Life of Pi – Which makes a better story, the real one or the fantasy? – may choose the real one, at least some of the time.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One question I'm often asked by readers is why is the news so negative? Murder and mayhem, political battles, the housing market. Of course, much news by its nature is negative; what went wrong, what is causing debate in society, what stands out. Planes landing safely is not news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is much more to news, and that is what these readers want. They aren't just interested in <span class="companylink">IKEA</span> monkey-type reports, but in consequential stories about good work being done by individuals, community groups and companies. And Canadians are themselves very committed to good works. According to Imagine Canada, formerly the Canadian Centre for Philanthropy, we are among the world's more active volunteers – 46 per cent of adults take part.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Globe and Mail covers these positive stories and has been rightly commended for its coverage of mental-health issues. But The Globe fell down dramatically last week with a story about <span class="companylink">Bell Canada</span>'s Let's Talk initiative. The campaign raised millions for mental-health services when Bell donated five cents for every tweet or message mentioning the campaign. (Bell's parent, BCE, owns 15 per cent of The Globe.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The article about the campaign included a very cynical headline: Bell's Let's Talk Campaign Cashes In. And the story said that behind the institutions that benefited from the millions raised, Bell's marketing machine was a winner. The article also referred to critics on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> and quoted one who described the campaign as a “cheap ploy.” The tweeter in question describes himself as a “man of deep thoughts of nonsense and malarkey.” So why would he be quoted? The fact that there are some cynical voices on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> isn't a surprise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Readers were quick to react, and The Globe did the right thing by printing several of their responses. An error is corrected on Page 2. But errors of tone or perceived bias must be dealt with in other ways, such as follow-up articles, letters to the editor or outside voices. All these methods were used for balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One letter from David Goldbloom and Louise Bradley of the Mental Health Commission of Canada castigated the story and said the cynicism “obscures and undermines an unprecedented commitment by a major corporation to do something substantive to improve the lives of Canadians affected by mental illness.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former federal finance minister Michael Wilson, a well-known mental-health advocate, was asked to write a response. In it, he described himself as “shocked by the tone. … The article distorts Bell's motivation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was also a follow-up discussion with Bell's Mary Deacon on why the company has chosen to support mental health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Derek DeCloet, Report on Business editor, said the original article's tone was wrong because there wasn't a clear understanding of what the story was about, as well as the headline and <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> reference. “There is nothing wrong with a company which is doing something good for the community, something philanthropic, to also see a positive marketing message from it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in the same vein, when an individual or a company is doing good work, journalists should not fall into a pattern that every story needs an opposition voice to balance it out. If it feels like a stretch to find someone critical, it probably is not necessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes there is little or no conflict in these stories, and good work by individuals or companies should stand on its own.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since when did those small, soft <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span> morph into a poor man's version of the <span class="companylink">Anaheim Ducks</span>, circa 2007?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not to say the local heroes are Stanley Cup material – far from it – but it does mean they are finally on the right track thanks to a series of player moves that drew little notice at the time but have transformed the Leafs into a team that can both skate and hit with anyone. There were four of them in all and none involved a player whose skill will attract notice, but each move was made with the thought of making the Leafs bigger, tougher and, perhaps most important, harder working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is usually not the splashy trade or big free-agent signing that gives an NHL team a much-needed change in personality. More often, it is the kind of moves former Leafs general manager Brian Burke and his successor, David Nonis, made with these four players, starting almost a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Defenceman Mark Fraser was the first to come, in a trade with the Ducks, Burke's former and now current employer, for prospect-turned-suspect Dale Mitchell. The 6-foot-4, 220-pound, Fraser was dispatched to the Leafs' Toronto Marlies farm team where he laboured until the Leafs' lockout-delayed training camp last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next up was Jay McClement, a big centre who put in seven seasons with the <span class="companylink">St. Louis Blues</span> and <span class="companylink">Colorado Avalanche</span> without threatening to make an all-star team. Burke signed him as a free agent while the Toronto media, yours truly included, yawned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next move was a retread, as enforcer Colton Orr, who was sent down to the Marlies a year ago by Burke and generated headlines by loudly bemoaning the move as a sign the fighter was obsolete in the NHL. Well, not quite as it turns out, since Orr is back holding down a spot on the right wing on the fourth line, although he's out of the lineup with an undisclosed injury. He is the only one who will not play Saturday night in Ottawa against the Senators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonis, who replaced Burke when his bosses decided the rough edges he likes in his hockey players and himself were not made for their boardroom, made the last move. He picked up 6-foot-5, 230-pound, winger Frazer McLaren on waivers from the <span class="companylink">San Jose Sharks</span> a couple of weeks after Burke was fired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Leafs head coach Randy Carlyle went to work, telling his players they had better start playing the physical brand of hockey he demands – making opposing defencemen nervous on the forecheck, crashing the net and generally knocking bodies around all over the ice. Those who do it the coach's way are rewarded, which is why all four of the above players earned regular jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Orr, McLaren and Fraser in the lineup, the Leafs now lead the NHL in fighting majors with 21 and they were the most-penalized team per game with an average of 18.1 minutes in penalties per game before Friday's schedule. But the room these bruisers create is worth it in Carlyle's view, although it helps that the Leafs improved as penalty killers from simply awful last season to a middling 15th in the league with an 82.3-per-cent success rate as of Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Individually, none of these players can make a difference on a team but collectively their industry and fearlessness rubs off on their teammates. James van Riemsdyk, for example, is shedding his reputation as a big skilled but soft winger by regularly crashing nets and now has 11 goals in 18 games. McClement is not someone who is known for his willingness to fight, but his addition may be the most important. He brought a dedication to hard labour that was not always evident on the Leafs over the years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We knew he would come in and he was going to work,” Carlyle said. “He separates himself with his work ethic alone. It's very noticeable on the ice when he's the first guy on the forecheck; he's the guy putting pressure on the puck. That's an asset, a skill that just isn't taught.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That's one of the things we're asking people to do. When you watch people like that go out and have that dogged work ethic, and he does it on a day-to-day basis, then why can't you?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And somewhere in an NHL press box, where he is marking time scouting for the Ducks until his next GM's job, Burke is smiling grimly and saying, “Tenacity, truculence and testosterone.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I was a child, I had a strange hobby. Lying in bed at night, I would imagine that my bedroom was not bedroom-sized at all, but, rather, matchbox-sized. This self-induced hallucination offered a kind of comfort. A place so small was a secret place. It was snug and safe, with everything in its proper spot. Books like The Flower Faeries or Mary Norton's The Borrowers were favourites, deepening my appreciation of the pleasures of extreme tininess and the strange feeling of sanctuary that seems to bloom in contemplating such dramatic disjunctures of scale.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Visiting Kim Adams's two new works at the <span class="companylink">Art Gallery of Ontario</span> this week – displayed by the gallery in celebration of his receipt of the $50,000 Gershon Iskowitz Prize – I found myself reminded of these private pleasures. Adams has a long history of working with the wee. Earlier sculptures like his Bruegel-Bosch-Bus, for example, married large and small. A recycled <span class="companylink">Volkswagen</span> camper van encrusted with an elaborate miniature world built from model parts, it suggests transport from an imagined past to an apocalyptic future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the AGO, Adams continues his explorations of such visual and somatic shifts. Travels through the Belly of the Whale is a metal space capsule (actually, it's a shiny new grain silo that Adams has perforated with metal funnels and Bundt pan peepholes) harbouring a hidden world: a tabletop-sized display of the open prairie complete with a wind turbine, a grain silo, crop fields, an ethanol plant and grazing cows. Is this an exit vehicle for some imagined environmental apocalypse? Only the train that moves on its track from inside to out hints at the Lilliputian scene within.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the AGO's Thomson Collection of Ship Models galleries, Adams presents another miniature world, the fifth in his series begun in the late eighties depicting utopian artists' colonies. Here, model-train cars and shipping containers are stacked to serve as high-rise apartment dwellings for creative types going about their teeny-tiny business. Micro crops of corn, tobacco, hops, wheat and marijuana (this is an artists' colony, after all) flourish on small patches of arable land or atop soil-filled shipping containers tucked in between a campground, a beer garden, a Movenpick cafe, a mini beach scene and a rail yard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet intimations of apocalypses can be found in this orderly cosmos. A zebra grazes amid the cows. Timelines are scrambled, with horse-drawn carts carrying beer casks (another latter-day Flemish touch) appearing alongside a contemporary monster truck rally. Snarling bears are treeing the campers, and, at the periphery of the scene, policemen place suspects under arrest. The mild threat of impending chaos percolates beneath the surface, but the artist has the box-car penthouse view. We glimpse him in his studio, high atop the scene, putting the finishing touches on his latest work of public art: a giant bronzed Popeye head, that figure of improbable pugnacity. (The head was part of a sweet dispenser he discovered in a Toronto candy shop on Queen Street years ago, and saved for the perfect moment.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adams says the fascination with toy trains and miniature worlds goes back to his earliest days. “There are baby pictures of me sitting on the dining-room table in the middle of my father's Lionel train set,” he says, “but I have no memory of that.” His later boyhood fascination with toy trucks led to some radical re-landscaping on the home front. “I kind of made a quarry pit in the back garden, as a place to play with them,” he recalls. “It was kind of an issue in the family, but they let me do it.” His teenage darkroom-turned-drawing studio under the stairs was another treasured hidey-hole, not to mention the cramped ice-fishing shacks of his childhood in northern Alberta. Best of all, though, were the miniature accommodations he discovered aboard trains. Adams has crossed Canada three times this way, the first time on his own at the age of 16. “I loved those spaces then and I still do,” he says. “It has now become something that you know is going to disappear. And you always think: Hey, this is a lot smaller than it was the last time I did this …”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kim Adams: Recent Works is on view at the <span class="companylink">Art Gallery of Ontario</span> until Aug. 11. Adams's work is also featured in the AGO's family March Break art camp titled Itty Bitty City, March 9-17, incorporating discovery of the museum's varied holdings of miniature art.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's always been much more to Los Angeles than Hollywoodland – even as it basks again in the Academy Awards spotlight. And while I've certainly taken some snaps on the Walk of Fame over the years – hunting for dubious honorees such as Judge Judy and Michael Bolton – I've tapped a couple of local experts for the latest low down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California travel writer Sara Benson (indietraveler.blogspot.com) has authored many books on the region, including the latest Lonely Planet Los Angeles guide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Many people think L.A. lacks culture but it has more than its share of top-ranked museums, especially for art lovers,” she says, recommending West L.A.'s Getty Center, Malibu's Getty Villa – both free – and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also some unique guided tours. Benson suggests the neon-spotting bus tour offered on summer evenings by the Museum of Neon Art. I'd also add a tour with quirky Esotouric, whose themes include Tom Waits' L.A. and the Haunts of Charles Bukowski.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those with a nose for news: book ahead for a free and fascinating Los Angeles Times building tour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transport-wise, the sprawling City of Angels can be less than angelic to navigate, generally favouring the almighty car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Benson notes that Metro Rail lines connect key tourist areas with downtown L.A., while local DASH buses – at just 50 cents a pop – link neighbourhoods like Chinatown and Little Tokyo. Check ahead via the travel planner at metro.net.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But don't dismiss the idea of a good stroll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a myth that nobody walks in L.A., but some neighbourhoods are easier to navigate on foot than others. The beach towns are all ideal for walking, as are iconic streets like Hollywood Boulevard and Melrose Avenue – plus the enclave of Beverly Hills,” says Benson, cautioning that, “Downtown isn't always easy or safe to walk around.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The region's white-sand hotspots are worth hiring a car for, though. Benson suggests hitting the beaches of Santa Monica and bohemian Venice or perhaps sliding into a little surf culture at Manhattan Beach or Huntingdon Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In my experience, funky Venice Beach is certainly worth an afternoon: it's a human safari park of colourful oddballs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For nightlife lovers, L.A. travel blogger Yulree Chun (yulch.blogspot.ca) also has plenty of suggestions for hanging with the locals. Her favourite bar is Villians Tavern on Palmetto Street downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If it was a person,” she says, “it would be that guy that graphic designs all day and plays his banjo at night. Filled with random knick-knacks, the place serves awesome craft beers and delicious food – and the live music is a big plus.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding Beer Belly, Mohawk Bend and Angel City Brewery to the pub-style mix, she also suggests a stylish cocktail joint for those who like glamming it up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My favourite place for pre-dinner or post-dinner cocktails is Perch. The drinks are good and there's a 360 view of downtown. Perfect for a romantic night out.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alternatively, peruse the pages of the latest LA Weekly to see what's on at Chung's favourite live music haunts. “If you want to dance, go to Echoplex. If you prefer a more chill atmosphere, the Hotel Cafe is your spot.” And if you want some swank, DJ-led booty shaking? “Check out Supperclub. Chic and exclusive, it's the club everyone loves to hate. Expect a heavy cover charge unless you're on a guest list.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a hangover-busting breakfast is required the next day, she suggests heading downtown to the Nickel Diner for traditional fare or dim sum at Elite Restaurant in Alhambra, a few minutes drive from downtown. There's also Koreatown's ever-popular El Tauro Taco truck for restorative burritos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if it's time for dinner, consider her three additional picks in the downtown area: Umamicatessen, Eat Drink Americano or Bestia – “you can't go wrong with their house-made charcuterie, gourmet pizzas or pastas.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am reliably informed by the bible of the entertainment racket, Variety, that Sunday's Academy's Awards telecast will end with “a special show-closing musical performance.” Apparently Kristin Chenoweth and host Seth MacFarlane will participate in a show-stopper after – yes, after – the announcement of the best-picture winner.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk about fiddling while Rome burns. Talk about the band playing while the Titanic sinks. Talk about a sad attempt to close the show after the audience has bolted. Honestly. What are they gonna do – build a song-and-dance routine about Argo and Zero Dark Thirty? Bless my soul, but it seems a bit much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It might seem unfair to speculate in advance, but history and personal experience tell me that by the time the best picture is announced, an enveloping tiredness and grim dismay have gripped the viewer. The last thing anyone needs is another musical number.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big thing, The Oscars (Sunday, ABC, CTV, 8:30 p.m.), is of course the dominating event this weekend. Perhaps Family Guy creator and by-reputation-cool-dude MacFarlane can make it wildly funny, fast-moving, and please everyone. Perhaps not. A question being asked in the TV racket is if MacFarlane is the right host for the female demographic that advertisers are so keen to reach during the show. Too late to turn back now, especially with the news that the shindig turns into an episode of Glee at the very end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Red-carpet coverage is what matters to many of you, of course. Frocks, footwear, hair and jewels – they all matter more than the merits of the movies. The red-carpet schedule is confusing to grasp. There's an hour of it on CTV starting at 6 p.m. Then, at 7, the coverage switches over to CTV Two, if you get that channel. Or you can watch online, it seems, as Ben Mulroney and his cohorts attempt to corral celebrities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fun stuff tends to be on the E! channel, which begins the frock opera at 6 p.m. and goes until the actual awards show opens at 8:30. Hours and hours of gazing at dresses, and many interruptions for commercials selling hair products. Fun times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are alternatives. NBC offers Saturday Night Live in the 2000s: Time and Again at 9 p.m. Relive old jokes and sketches, if you wish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TLC has a marathon of Gypsy Sisters: Extra Bling (it starts at 8 p.m.), which opens with an episode in which “Nettie worries that her sister Mellie's stripping and fighting are getting out of hand.” Something we can all identify with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a new episode of Republic of Doyle (CBC, 9 p.m.), during which the death of Leslie's dad is ruled suspicious; high tension ensues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a fresh episode of The Walking Dead (AMC, 9 p.m.) is probably going to challenge the Academy Awards for viewer numbers. This week, “Rick and the group must make a choice when security is threatened.” That happens every week, but people still watch in the millions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, there is a new episode of Girls (Sunday, HBO Canada, 9 p.m.) that isn't scintillating; it involves Hannah and Jessa going to upstate New York to visit Jessa's father. Melancholy ensues. By the way, on Saturday, HBO Canada runs a marathon of the first four episodes of this season of Girls, starting at 9 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, if you do stick with the Academy Awards, at least pay attention to the Canadian content among the nominees, which is substantial this year. Composer Mychael Danna has two shots – best original score for Life of Pi; and a co-writer nom for best original song, Pi's Lullaby. (You do know Life of Pi is adapted from the novel by Canadian Yann Martel, right?) Contending for best foreign-language film is Kim Nguyen's Rebelle (called War Witch in English). Canada has two nominations in best live-action short: Yan England for Henry; and Sam French and Ariel Nasr for Buzkashi Boys. Jim Erickson is co-nominated for best production design for Lincoln; and Guillaume Rocheron, with his Moving Picture Company, is nominated for best visual effects for his work on Life of Pi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Go Canada! Or go watch Girls and Gypsy Sisters. Beware of musical numbers done late at night on Sunday – possibly more horror than you'll find on The Walking Dead.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Polar bears are starving, and human beings are to blame. Global warming is melting the sea ice and cutting them off from their food supplies. Soon the only polar bears left will be in zoos. If you want to see them in the wild, you'd better hurry up, because by mid-century the polar bear population could decline by two-thirds.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's not fun to see a mother bear watch her cubs falling dead because she can no longer nurse them,” University of Alberta scientist Andrew Derocher told the CBC last week. He thinks desperate times call for desperate measures. One option would be to save the bears by feeding them ourselves. Other options might include shipping the bears farther north, or penning them up in a sort of temporary bear park, or even euthanizing them. “We want governments to be ready with conservation and management plans for polar bears when a worst-case climate change scenario happens,” he declared in a press release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's some news you won't hear from Dr. Derocher. The polar-bear population is not declining. In fact, it's much bigger than it was 40 years ago, when a global hunting ban was introduced. After dwindling to a few thousand, the number of polar bears has rebounded to 20,000 or 25,000 today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is essentially a heartening fact, but nobody knows it,” says Zac Unger, a California writer who planned to write a book on the end of the polar bears. Instead, he wound up writing a book about the loss of scientific integrity. It's called Never Look a Polar Bear in the Eye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get his story, Mr. Unger (who describes himself as a classic Bay-area liberal) moved with his family to Churchill, Man., the polar bear capital of the world. Churchill's bear population is around 1,000, which is roughly the same size as the human population. Because the town is relatively easy to get to, it's a magnet for bear researchers, filmmakers and tourists. Most of the polar bears you see on TV are Churchill bears. They are so abundant that they stroll into town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I set out to write this mournful elegy for the polar bear, and then I got there and the bears were doing better than I'd thought – which was great news for the bears but terrible for my book,” Mr. Unger told me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of emaciated bears, what he found was a vigorous scientific debate between catastrophists and other scientists who are far more optimistic. But the public only hears one side. Mr. Unger found that the catastrophists have abandoned proper science for polemics – what he calls science by sound bite. “When you say that the polar bears are going to be dead by a certain date, you are making a political point, not a scientific one,” he says. “I don't think they're dishonest people, but any time they have a choice or an assumption to make, they choose the worst-case scenario.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also don't take kindly to dissent. People who disagree with them are sometimes banned from their conferences, or labelled as “climate deniers.” Mr. Unger himself has been called a climate denier, which he's not. He just thinks the story is more nuanced than a sound bite. There are 19 different bear populations in the world. Some are doing fine and some are not, and with some we just don't know. Sea ice is only one of many factors that may influence the bears' health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northerners are generally contemptuous of fly-in experts from the South. The polar bears they see are doing fine, not that anyone cares what they think. One experienced ranger – who has helped countless researchers prepare projects meant to prove the bears are doomed – told Mr. Unger: “I'm just starting to resent being told that I'm not seeing what I know abso-flipping-lutely damn well that I'm seeing with my own eyes.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other day I had a chat with Kelsey Eliasson, a polar bear guide who lives in Churchill and writes a blog about the bears. “I've done 14 bear seasons,” he told me. “There've been some good years and some really bad years. But nobody is seeing a constant decline.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Eliasson is skeptical of doom-and-gloom scenarios based on computer models – on which scientists such as Dr. Derocher rely heavily. “There is a widespread belief in the North these days that researchers and NGOs have become more interested in media face-time than actual polar bear research,” he says. “They are super nice guys. I had incredible respect for them, but now I'm blogging against them. I just feel like they're lost.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Churchill's bears are among the most poked, prodded and scrutinized creatures in the world. They are chased by helicopter or tundra buggy, and drugged so that researchers can analyze their blood, their bodies and their teeth. An estimated 80 per cent of Churchill's bears have encountered researchers – sometimes more than once. In Mr. Eliasson's view, the best way we can help the bears is to stop harassing them. “Declare a five-year moratorium,” he says. “Leave them alone. Everyone around here would be in favour of that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Unger has another suggestion for polar bear researchers. Stop doing politics and get back to doing science, which is by its very nature complicated and uncertain. Of course, the headlines might die down. But the alternative is to risk being utterly discredited. And that would not be good for polar bears, scientists or anybody else.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As tempting as it is to make fun of the $5 pickle, I'm going to play this one straight. The pickle, by the way, or more precisely “daily pickles” (who in their right mind would pay $5 for a single pickle?) is the first menu item at PiDGiN, the new Downtown Eastside restaurant that protesters have targeted as symbolic of the gentrification they say is forcing them out of their neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pickle debate, such as it was, arose from a thread on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> about why protesters would choose this particular restaurant to make their point. Why not Bitter, the newly opened Sean Heather establishment nearby, or some other place?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consensus seems to be that it comes down to two things: the name PiDGiN, and the location, directly across from Pigeon Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These guys in particular are a good target for the anti-gentrification movement in the Downtown Eastside because they kind of make things clear,” Ivan Drury of the Carnegie Community Action Project told me earlier this week. “It's opened directly across the street from Pigeon Park – which is kind of a cultural centre for indigenous Downtown Eastside low-income residents. We feel that they're thumbing their nose at people,” he said. By “they're,” he means the restaurant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Centre for indigenous culture” would not be my first description of Pigeon Park, but then, I don't live in the neighbourhood. It is true that until the restaurant frosted over its windows late this week (protesters were shining flashlights in and taking photos of patrons, according to restaurant staff), the place offered a clear view of the park. Perfect for “poverty tourists,” as one person put it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the name and the location, the second theory is that the restaurant, which is just the latest addition to a growing list of higher-end establishments brave enough to step foot in the neighbourhood, has crossed a line physically, psychologically or both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is gentrification moving east, moving further and further into the heart of the Downtown Eastside and encroaching on the few spaces that low-income people have left to them,” Mr. Drury said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This isn't just about overpriced pickles. The PiDGiN protest, which some are dismissing as frivolous, helps shine a light – if you will – on a serious issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Carnegie Community Action Project released a report this week detailing what it says is the increasingly unaffordable cost of housing in the neighbourhood. The group says 426 single-occupancy hotel rooms that rented for $375 a month in 2011 cost more than $425 in 2012; $375 is the basic social assistance shelter rate for a single person.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a bigger issue for us than any single restaurant – this is a systemic problem. Gentrification is a force both cultural and economic that is taking over the Downtown Eastside and displacing the lower-income community,” Mr. Drury said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of that may be true, insofar as any one socio-economic group can lay claim to a particular neighbourhood. Yes, rich people do it all the time, but we expect poor people to be more welcoming, don't we? After all, we're just trying to spruce the place up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But here's where Mr. Drury loses me:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This place is like in the civil rights movement in the Southern States. People would take on businesses that profited from segregation in order to give a message to the higher levels of government and ask for legal changes. In a way that's what's happening here with this PiDGiN protest,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The irony in this, of course, is that Mr. Drury and his group appear to be in favour of segregation – bent on keeping anyone who isn't low-income out of the neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In their long list of impossible demands, they want the Hastings and Oppenheimer corridors recognized as a special “social justice zone” where hundreds of new social housing units would be built with public money and rent controls would be imposed on private landlords.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is the last place in the city where low-income people can afford to live and where they can feel comfortable. Residents say what's important to them is that they feel a sense of belonging here, where they feel scorn and judgment from other parts of the city,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it stands, there is no reason the Downtown Eastside should be immune to the development pressure being felt everywhere else in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business will go where the rent is cheap, even if it means asking their customers to venture into unfamiliar territory, or wade through protesters who cast their own brand of scorn and judgment.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All week long I have been fizzing in anticipation of the Kimye baby. Kim Kardashian and Kanye West (a.k.a. Kimye, in case you've been living under a rock) have combined their celebrated DNA to produce a glistening specimen of modern beauty and fame – the mammalian equivalent of Damien Hirst's glittering diamond skull. Due in July and still barely a billow under Kimmy's <span class="companylink">Dolce &amp; Gabbana</span> jeggings, already the preparations are so elaborate they are setting <span class="companylink">Google</span> agog. The latest news, reported in every uncharted corner of the Internet, is that the couple are building a $2-million “nanny wing” on the back of their Bel Air mansion to house the team of staff being hired in advance of the new arrival. The vast extension is said to comprise three large bedrooms, three bathrooms, a kitchen/living area, separate nursery and a full-service spa for the team of live-in staff who will be hired to care for the most anticipated Hollywood baby since Brangelina put their international munchkin hunt on pause. When Kimye finally replicates, there will be not one but three full-time, live-in nannies to assist in the first diaper change – an event that will undoubtedly be undertaken with the grave trepidation usually reserved for detaching Siamese twins and will likely be simulcast instantly around the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the opposite end of the spectrum and also due in July is the other royal baby, the one currently gestating in the narrow, insufficiently insulated environs of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. Like the Kimye baby, the royal baby will be queen or king – and not just of the TV ratings or the Billboard charts but of several countries (a ragged little Empire in fact) including our own. That baby, it was recently announced, will not be having a nanny. Instead, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, and Kate, who, according to Palace sources, wish to be “hands-on parents,” will have part-time sitters to attend to their child when they are at public events. It's an unprecedented break with royal tradition, which has long seen the nanny at the centre of the royal household, and a great historical comfort for children with duty-bound, corgi-obsessed parents. Prince William, in fact, was so close to one of his early nannies that Princess Diana is said to have replaced her in a jealous fit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amazing isn't it, the extremes expectant couples will go to in an effort to prove, in advance of their first baby's arrival, that they are going to be the World's Best Parents. Both Kimye's and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's respective plans have a certain inherent logic, but neither one is practical. Kimye's urge to throw money at the issue is something I identify with in my own scaled-down way. (Like most expectant mothers, I spent the last month of my pregnancy furiously shopping online for stuff I didn't need or use.) Similarly the frugal, ultra-private Kate and William approach is also understandable. I, too, was loath to accept the presence of a stranger in my house during the early days of new motherhood – until I realized it meant I could actually do fun stuff like have a shower and brush my teeth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact is, it's just as ludicrous and excessive to hire three overpaid nannies as it is self-flagellating to refuse to hire one, especially if you have work to do and can afford it (as Kate and William certainly can). What separates these famous parents from the rest of the population, however, is that they are – though their extreme approaches to childcare – attempting to transmit a public message about the sort of parents they are going to be, and how their child will be extra-specially loved as a result.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Admittedly, Kimye gets points for pulling out all the stops. Each modern-day Mary Poppins they hire will have a rumoured salary of $250,000 per annum, a private car and a new phone so that they can (according to an unnamed source) “stay in contact with Kim and Kanye around the clock.” If I were Kourtney Kardashian (if only for one magical, French-manicured afternoon), I'd take my sister aside and whisper off-camera, “Listen, babe, you do realize it's an infant you're expecting, not a crazy third-world despot?” Ironically, the ostensible reason for the Kimye baby prep is the couple's need for privacy. According to the tabs, “Kim and Kanye feel it's important to have a separate area marked off so that they can still spend time alone together as a family.” Now there's an excellent piece of Hollywood logic: If they didn't build the nanny wing, they couldn't be a normal family, right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The whole of human-parenting history could be contained in these two drastically different approaches to celebrity childcare. But the funny thing is, both the Kimye baby and the royal sprog are destined for similar fates, no matter the amount of staff they have, or don't have, to protect them. A life of preordained exposure is something no baby deserves to be born into, no matter how beautiful, rich or privileged they might turn out to be. Who can blame new parents for trying to protect the innocent unborn, even when it's clearly impossible?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span> have finally figured out the hockey gods.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They cheer for the Maple Leafs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What else can explain the coincidence? Tragedy strikes, and the next cheer the beleaguered hockey club hears is “Go, Leafs, Go!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A week ago, right after the Senators lost their best – make that the NHL's best – defenceman, Erik Karlsson, they faced the Maple Leafs in Toronto and lost 3-0.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saturday in the nation's capital, right after losing their best – make that the NHL's best – goaltender, Craig Anderson, they will face … guess who?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Leafs also have injuries – most specifically to goaltender James Reimer (knee) – and both teams are showing surprisingly well so far in the standings. Each will play its 19th game of this 48-game season, and each has 22 points. The Senators are keen to avenge last week's loss to Toronto – even without Anderson in net.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senators have so much traffic going between Binghamton, N.Y., and Ottawa lately that it is, at times, difficult to the tell the American Hockey League Senators from the National Hockey League Senators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They lost their best centre when the shrunken season had barely begun when Jason Spezza went out with back surgery. They called up centre Stephan Da Costa from Binghamton, sent him back down on Friday, and called up goaltender Robin Lehner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team might consider establishing a halfway house in Ogdensburg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They lost Karlsson when the skate blade of <span class="companylink">Pittsburgh Penguins</span> menace Matt Cooke cut into the Achilles tendon of last year's Norris Trophy winner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And on Thursday they lost Anderson when speedy <span class="companylink">New York Rangers</span> forward Chris Kreider stepped on the stick of Ottawa defenceman Marc Methot and fell hard into Anderson, spraining the goaltender's ankle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spezza and Karlsson are said to be lost for the season. Anderson is listed “day-to-day” and could be back in a week or two. It looked much worse as he limped off under assistance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm speaking, I'm sure, for a lot of the guys on the team when I say my heart sank into my stomach,” Methot said following the game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Backup goaltender Ben Bishop finished the third period and overtime for the Senators, who finally won the game 3-2 in a 14-player shootout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Another 2 pts,” Anderson tweeted to his fans later. “Bish stood tall. Hard place to come in the game. My ankle's going to be OK. Be back ASAP.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“One guy goes down, another guy steps up,” Bishop said Friday morning, “and I don't think that's going to stop.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle between Ottawa and Binghamton has proved far more successful than most experts predicted when the Senators lost Spezza and Karlsson. Since last Saturday's loss to the Leafs, the Senators went on to beat <span class="companylink">New York Islanders</span>, <span class="companylink">New Jersey Devils</span> and <span class="companylink">New York Rangers</span>, two of the games going to shootout. Unknown players and rookies have played key roles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Head coach Paul MacLean thinks the reasons are obvious. One, the leadership of such players as captain Daniel Alfredsson – so despised by Maple Leafs fans who will take great delight in booing him at home Saturday. Two, the depth of players scouting and drafting has produced. And three, hard work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Work ethic and structure has always been the cornerstone since I've been here,” MacLean said Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A lot of these players know how to play and know how we want them to play and they just do it. They're getting an opportunity. The energy that players from the <span class="companylink">American Hockey League</span> bring is that opportunity to play in the <span class="companylink">National Hockey League</span> – and that's part of the energy they bring every night. And part of what makes it go is youthful enthusiasm and energy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Youth was much on display Friday as 22-year-old Karlsson spoke to the media for the first time since the successful surgery to repair his Achilles tendon. He said Cooke had tried to reach out by text message but Karlsson did not respond and has no intention of responding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still angry, the all-star defenceman said he did not believe Cooke meant to cut him, but meant “to hit me hard, knock me out. … He's been after me before, ever since I got into this league.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Karlsson‘s opinion, the injury could have been prevented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'll be back,” he vowed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, too, will Anderson and Spezza.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quite apart from the legitimacy of his housing allowance claims, the question of Senator Mike Duffy's non-residency in Prince Edward Island is a serious issue because it speaks to the legitimacy of the Senate itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Confederation debates, Sir John A. Macdonald set out the logic behind our bicameral federal Parliament. “In the Upper House equality in numbers [among regions] should be the basis,” Macdonald said, “in the Lower House population should be the basis.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate's other roles, such as to represent property, and to serve as an appointed counterbalance to the “will of the mob” (Sir George-Étienne Cartier's words), are no longer defensible. But the case for “equality in numbers” among regions, to counteract the exigencies of population, remains the essential purpose of the Senate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If individual senators do not take their duty to their province and region seriously enough to actually observe the requirement of residency, then it is hard to make any case for the Senate whatsoever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet given the federal nature of our institutions and the sprawling nature of our geography, and given the important and unheralded sober-second-thought work that the Senate does via its committees, in effect improving legislation in the service of the House of Commons, the Senate is needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who advocate abolition, such as the federal New Democrats, have an agenda beyond poking a stick at the carcass of a chamber that is seen by much of the public to lack legitimacy. They want power centralized in Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other federal states, such as Australia, the United States, and Germany, have found ways to effectively reflect their federal nature in their legislative structures. There is no reason Canada cannot do the same with what the constitutional scholar Ned Franks calls “one of the most unreformed chambers in the <span class="companylink">British Commonwealth</span>.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impetus for reform has largely come from the West, but it is in the national interest to make sure that regions are adequately represented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1985, the Alberta Select Special Committee on Senate Reform set out a model for a Senate that would be directly elected, with each province represented by an equal number of senators, and with effective powers to provide a “regional voice.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The committee also expressed the province's frustration by declaring that “Alberta's proper place in Confederation can only be secured with a Senate constituted in a more credible manner.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless of its merits, that vision is unattainable. The virtual impossibility of a constitutional amendment, especially with a Parti Québécois government in Quebec, negates wholesale reform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor does the alienation argument hold water. Alberta has found its “proper place,” in spite of this vestigial survival of Victorian conservatism. However, that does not obviate the desirability of reform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To his credit, Prime Minister Stephen Harper has taken the matter seriously, proposing to change the nomination process, and to introduce term limits. He should seek to implement these reforms, and also push for a joint resolution affirming a “suspensive” veto, which would limit the Senate to delaying (rather than defeating) legislation. These are limited and attainable changes that should not concern the Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many options better than the existing system of nominations based solely on the patronage of the prime minister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To begin with, the nominations should come from the provinces to avoid senators becoming another brand of national party politician. Senatorial elections are the best way to select them and, with a goal of finding a different cast of characters, such consultative votes should be held in conjunction with provincial elections when vacancies arise, rather than with federal elections. If provinces don't want to give their citizens a vote, their legislatures or lieutenant-governors could be invited to draw up a short list of candidates, from among whom the nominee could be chosen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate generally does not defeat legislation, but respects a gentlemen's and ladies' agreement to withhold use of its powers. So, in practice, a suspensive veto already exists. With a constitutional amendment impossible, the two houses could adopt a joint resolution to affirm this practice. It would not be legally binding, but how likely is it that such a resolution could be ignored in the future? <span class="companylink">Britain's Parliament</span> adopted the suspensive veto for the House of Lords in 1911.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, as direct elections to the Senate are beyond reach, term limits are needed. Nominees should be limited to serve the life of two full Parliaments, to a maximum of 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regrettably, other needed reforms are off the table, including a reallocation of seats to ensure the West is more fairly represented, such as was floated by the Murray-Austin amendment in 2006. As it stands, the four Atlantic provinces, with a 7-per-cent share of Canada's population, have 30 senators. The four Western provinces, with more than 30 per cent of the population, have just 24 senators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some modest initial improvements to the Senate, particularly those advocated by Mr. Harper, are uncontroversial to most Canadians, and would demonstrate that incremental reform is possible, and desirable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada has undergone dramatic institutional change from 1867, from the establishment of a Supreme Court, the effects of the Statute of Westminster, 1931, the adoption of a Charter of Rights and Freedoms, to the pending elimination of male primogeniture for determining Canada's head of state. It is not too much to ask that the Senate of Canada join the 21st century.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jack Nicklaus won 18 major championships and finished second in another 19. At 73, he's entitled to sit back and reflect on his accomplishments in golf. But he prefers to keep working, so he presides over Golden Bear Inc., encompassing his worldwide businesses.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He'll be in Toronto on Tuesday for a hospital fundraiser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicklaus's businesses include, among other enterprises, golf course design, wines, clothing, books, and even the Golden Bear line of lemonades, launched a year ago and thriving. This week's WGC-<span class="companylink">Accenture</span> Match Play Championship in Marana, Ariz., is being played on the Dove Mountain course he designed. Nicklaus and his company have generated 365 golf courses in 34 countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicklaus's organization is based in an office building here in Golden Bear Plaza, a few minutes away from his home and The Bear's Club, a course he designed and where he plays. He'll be there Monday for a one-day event to raise money for the Nicklaus Children's Health Care Foundation, the charitable initiative in which he and his wife, Barbara, are involved. The event is in memory of their late grandson, Jake, who was 17 months old when he drowned in a hot tub accident eight years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ernie Els, Keegan Bradley, Greg Norman, Rory McIlroy and other stars will play Monday, as will David Hearn of Brantford, Ont.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hearn will then join a strong field in the Honda Classic, which starts Thursday at the nearby PGA National Champion course. Nicklaus effectively redesigned that course, which reopened in 1990, and has continued to improve it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The course is the main reason the Honda Classic's field, which includes defending champion McIlroy, Els, Bradley and Tiger Woods, has become so strong. The Nicklaus Children's Health Care Foundation is the tournament's main beneficiary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a big week for us,” Nicklaus said recently, sitting in his office during an hour-long interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicklaus will travel after the Monday fundraiser to Augusta, Ga. He'll stop en route to play the Augusta National Golf Club on Tuesday morning and then proceed to Toronto for a private function that evening to benefit the Robotic Prostate Cancer Surgical Program at Toronto East General Hospital. Six-time major champion Nick Faldo will also be there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicklaus will return home after the event, and will participate in a variety of ways – although, of course, not as a player – in the Honda Classic. Come April, Nicklaus will be at the Masters. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the first of his six wins at Augusta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, the Glen Abbey Golf Club in Oakville, Ont., will play host to the RBC Canadian Open. The course will be the venue for the 26th time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glen Abbey was the first course Nicklaus designed entirely on his own. He had been an active participant in Canadian golf since he played the 1958 Canadian Amateur at the Scarboro Golf and Country Club in Toronto. He lost in the first round of the match play championship, but that didn't stop him from returning to Canada year after year for the Canadian Open after he turned professional. It was the beginning of a long and significant relationship with Canadian golf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I would have developed a lot closer relationship if I'd won the Canadian Open,” Nicklaus said. (He finished second seven times.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Barbara kept sending me back. She said: ‘I'm going to keep sending you back until you get it right.'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He came closest to winning, perhaps, in the 1984 Canadian Open at Glen Abbey, finishing second to Norman. Twenty-nine years later, Nicklaus says with a laugh he, in fact, “finished first to Norman,” rather than second. Norman also won the 1992 Canadian Open at Glen Abbey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“On 17 [in 1984], Greg hit his second shot over the green in the last round, and into the parking lot,” Nicklaus recalls. “They had removed the [out of bounds] stakes for the parking lot, so he got to play it, and he ended up beating me by a shot [two shots, in fact]. I should have won it there, but they ruled it the way they ruled it, that the stakes weren't there, and so he wasn't out of bounds, so I didn't win. That's okay. That's the way it goes. That's the way the ball bounces.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two or three years later, Nicklaus was playing a practice round for the Bing Crosby Pro-Am in Pebble Beach, Calif. (now the <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span> Pebble Beach National Pro-Am), when he had another close encounter with Canadian golf. This time with Canadian golfers Richard Zokol and Jim Nelford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicklaus leaned back in his chair and couldn't stop laughing as he recalled what he refers to as “one of my favourite stories.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was playing Cypress Point, then one of the courses used in the tournament. His friends, amateurs Bob Hogue and Pandel Savic, and the English tour pro Howard Clark, were in his foursome. Zokol and Nelford were playing in front of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clark was playing his first <span class="companylink">PGA</span> Tour event. He'd never seen Cypress Point. Its par-three, 225-yard 16th hole is probably the most photographed hole in the game. The green is on a peninsula, surrounded by the Pacific Ocean and crashing waves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's an absolutely gorgeous day,” Nicklaus recalled, “and we walk around the corner to the 16th tee, there's a fog bank and you can't see your hand in front of your face. We're coming to the most famous par-three in the world, and you can't see it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Up ahead, Zokol had been plotting a practical joke and Nelford co-operated. They waited for the Nicklaus group to play. A ball landed on the green. Zokol hoped it would be a MacGregor, which Nicklaus played. But it wasn't. Zokol took the ball, a Spalding, and put it in the hole. He knew it was Clark's ball.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zokol and Nelford were on the 17th green when they heard a roar from the 16th green.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Everybody's congratulating Howard, yelling and screaming,” Nicklaus recalled. “It's unbelievable, the first time Howard's played the hole and he never even saw the hole and gets a hole-in-one. So we press our bets and play 17. We go to the 18th tee, walk up, there's a little note on the tee. ‘Nice shot, Howard. Ha-ha. The crazy Canucks.' I love that story.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That night, Nicklaus told the story when he addressed a gathering of golf writers. “It was a great relief to me that Nicklaus took it in the right spirit,” Zokol said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicklaus is a member of the Canadian Golf Hall of Fame, having been inducted in 1995, in the builder category for his involvement in Canadian golf and his Glen Abbey course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also designed the excellent Loxahatchee Golf Club in Jupiter, Fla., which his close friend, Toronto businessman Gordon Gray, developed. The late Jack Grout, Nicklaus's dear friend and long-time instructor, had a home there. Nicklaus frequently fished for salmon on the Restigouche River in New Brunswick with Gray.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Weir was 13 when he wrote Nicklaus to ask him if he should stay a left-handed golfer or switch to right-handed. Nicklaus advised him to stick with his natural southpaw style. Weir went on to win the 2003 Masters and seven other <span class="companylink">PGA</span> Tour events. He and Nicklaus have spoken frequently about the game. Weir acknowledges Nicklaus as an important influence and even mentor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Muirfield Village Golf Club, meanwhile, Nicklaus chose former Canadian Open chairman Richard Grimm to be a member of his Captains' Club. Grimm was also instrumental in getting Nicklaus to design Glen Abbey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We felt we should have a Canadian representative within our Captains' Club,” Nicklaus said. “Dick Grimm was far and away the most obvious choice. He's been a tremendous contributor and supporter of our tournament.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, Nicklaus has been a tremendous contributor to and supporter of Canadian golf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I've had some great times in Canada,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given his relationship with Canadian golf, even if he never did win the country's most important championship, it's not surprising he'll be in Toronto on Tuesday during one of the busiest weeks on his calendar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifty-five years have passed since Nicklaus came north for the first time to play the Canadian Amateur. His bond with Canada remains strong.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well before tabling this week's budget, Premier Christy Clark had signalled that it would be balanced. She was staking her party's future on it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Clark is well aware of the long odds her Liberal government faces in May's election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Premier's party is weighed down by the political baggage a government invariably accumulates after 12 years in power. Its only hope – and it's a faint one – is persuading a skeptical populace that, despite its many short-comings, the free-enterprise coalition the Liberals represent is still the best option for creating jobs and managing the province's finances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is why, after four successive deficits, Ms. Clark needed to head into the spring campaign boasting that she had balanced the books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond that, she even had a plan, highly speculative as it was, to eliminate the provincial debt using riches from a booming liquefied natural gas industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to have any hope of winning, the Liberals also need help from the New Democratic Party, which has held a seemingly unbeatable lead in the polls for months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The governing party not only requires NDP Leader Adrian Dix to stumble in the harsh glare of an election campaign, but also needs his party to scare voters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Presenting an election platform that somehow underscores the Liberals' claim that a New Democratic government would create a fiscal debacle might do just that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the Liberals believe they may get their wish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the degree to which the New Democrats trashed Finance Minister Mike de Jong's budget as unfairly raising taxes, not spending enough in health and education and several other areas and using unsold Crown assets to help balance the books, it seems the NDP would be prepared to spend more at the expense of squaring the ledger sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, it looks like the NDP will campaign on a program that includes a deficit budget for this year and maybe beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is precisely what the Liberals were hoping for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remember, the Liberals want the May 14 election to be about the economy and who's best able to run the treasury. The NDP wants it to be about credibility and trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the vast collection of mistakes and scandals the Liberals have amassed in their time in power, the New Democrats certainly have a better chance of defining the final ballot box question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP is likely buoyed, too, by the results of the first post-budget poll, which showed only 12 per cent of British Columbians believe the Liberals' financial plan actually was balanced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same Ipsos-Reid poll of 1,200 eligible voters also found that only 13 per cent of respondents said the budget made them more likely to vote for Ms. Clark's Liberals while 24 per cent said it made them less likely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those results, you would think, would make the NDP more comfortable about presenting an election platform that includes a deficit budget. And they were certainly the numbers that were highlighted in media reports about the poll. One other result, however, got less attention than perhaps was warranted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked if the province's financial situation would be better or worse with Adrian Dix and the NDP running the province, only 23 per cent said they felt B.C. would be much or somewhat better off, while 40 per cent said it would be worse or somewhat worse off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which brings me back to the Liberals' faint hope of making this election competitive. It rests almost entirely on trying to persuade the electorate that the New Democrats would go on an unsustainable spending spree that would lead to successive deficits and a ballooning cumulative debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Clark is sure to point to the six successive deficits to which Mr. Dix was linked when he was chief of staff to Glen Clark during his time as finance minister and then later as premier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An NDP election manifesto based on a deficit budget, with perhaps the promise of more to come, could help the Liberals reinforce the notion that New Democrats aren't to be trusted with money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the Liberals have just finished running a string of deficits of their own, although they could, and likely will, argue they were in good company thanks to the Great Recession. And that they have returned to balance quicker than most provinces in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, it would appear that the public isn't prepared to give the Liberals another chance regardless of any arguments or excuses they put forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But B.C.'s governing party believes the New Democrats may yet breathe life into prospects that look completely dead.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been much speculation around Pope Benedict XVI's resignation. For a week now, rumours have swirled on the Internet that the Pope is retiring within the Vatican City to avoid arrest in some kind of lawsuit. Then, Thursday, the Italian daily newspaper La Repubblica reported that the Pope decided to resign Dec. 17, the day he received the findings of a probe into the “Vatileaks” affair, including allegations of a network of gay priests and the blackmailers they'd attracted.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, it was disclosed that Pope Benedict has undergone heart surgery, providing a reasonable explanation for leaving any job – except the one of being God's chosen representative on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pope cited his “incapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted to me” in “today's world, subject to so many rapid changes.” This was the same week the producers of Maker's Mark announced they were lowering the alcohol content of their bourbon: Here was the leader of the Catholic church bemoaning his inability to adapt to a changing world. Has everyone forgotten their brand? Since when did the Catholic church agonize over its inability to respond to change? Not responding to change is what the church does best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then, on the heels of the Pope's announcement another story broke, almost as though he'd sought to get in front of it – a story I like to believe is more likely to explain his hasty retirement: A team of Japanese scientists has announced the discovery of a sea slug that has a disposable penis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sea slugs are hermaphrodites. As human knowledge grows, God's occasional whimsicality with sex organs is something the church has had to confront. An animal with both sets raises questions for a church so particular about gender roles. And given that Pope Benedict XVI's predecessor, John Paul II, took the position that animals have souls, the soul of a sea slug in a body possessed of two sets of sex organs might have been a worry to the pontiff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sea slugs mate with both sets of sex organs, concurrently. I imagine (reminding you that sin lies not in the desire, but only in acting upon that desire) that double-sex must be a pretty tempting proposition, one that could lead many a sea slug astray. Twice. And at the same time. Sea-slug <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> postings must be novella length. Questions abound: Does the involvement of four sex organs automatically make the most mundane Monday-night, post-“let's-see-what's-on-Netflix” sea-slug encounter an orgy?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm guessing that the church would sanction that, provided the sea slugs really concentrated on what went where, with no funny stuff – but remember, sea slugs live underwater, and are at the mercy of the currents. Two pious sea slugs could be lining up their organs just fine, by the book, and then suddenly a large tuna, say, could swim over them. The poor little things could get flipped around in the act of procreation and suddenly they'd be having a big, gay, tuna-induced orgy. One wave and the purest of sea-slug couples attempting to form a blessed union might inadvertently find him/herself and him/herself in an aquatic version of Satyricon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'd like to believe that while these things weighed heavily on him, like other popes before him, the Pope grappled with their theological implications, as was his lot, until news came of a sea slug that, post-coitus, drags his/her penis alongside him/herself for 20 minutes before casually discarding it and then growing another one within 24 hours – and that proved too much. Consider the moral issues a detachable penis raises: If one of God's creatures uses a different penis every time he has sex, is he a virgin each time? Would any sea slug drawn into the service of the Lord have to stop being a priest for the 24 hours she didn't have a penis?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this would be enough to throw any pontiff into spiritual crisis, but, what's more, the sea-slug penis in question appears to be covered with tiny spines that scrape out any competing sperm inside the vagina-like organ of his/her partner as he himself attempts fertilization. Thus, he disposes of his rival's seed when he ditches his used penis. We're confronted with a removable penis that is also an effective, though selective, form of birth control. What Pope wouldn't feel overwhelmed?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Word has it that Benedict will issue a decree speeding up the process of appointing his replacement. While the pontiff is fatigued, he recognizes that there must be guidance – during this, the age of the disposable penis.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I recently flipped through aerial photos of Canadian cities in the 1970s. One thing stood out: the parking lots. They were everywhere. Downtown Vancouver was a checkerboard of them. Post-Olympic Montreal was streaked with them. Toronto, especially south of King Street, seemed to be nothing but one giant, contiguous grey parking lot yawning across the lakefront.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, I returned to Canada after living abroad for almost a decade, and was struck by the disappearance of those acres of cement emptiness. Toronto's waterfront had become a wall of elegant glass housing towers, their tens of thousands of residents turning this former lonely wasteland into a thriving human community. Montreal is seeing its first new high-rise housing boom in more than 20 years, as the postindustrial southwestern corner of the island is populated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, of course, Vancouver has been remade dramatically, rendered into a thickly vertical city jammed with people and activity. Its combination of high population density in cozy downtown neighbourhoods, intimate street life and popular public transit has become one of Canada's leading exports: When I visit cities in Europe and the United States, their officials talk earnestly of adopting “Vancouverism.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Vancouverize, in the minds of mayors, is to make residents realize that having a crowded, people-packed downtown core is not a problem but a solution. Canadians have known the grim tedium of low-density cities, but now we're known for the opposite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melbourne, Australia's second-largest city, has just released a report calling for a boldly Vancouverist solution to its urban-sprawl problem. (The 600-page report drops the word “Vancouver” almost 300 times.) “Vancouver has succeeded in preserving its liveability,” it concludes, “through the early and creative acceptance of the need for increased residential densities.” The B.C. city “is defined by a mixed-use commercial development of medium height located at the base of a high-rise residential tower, which is recessed from the lower levels and from the streets below” – the mighty Vancouver condo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet one place where Vancouverism has lost steam is in Canada. Developers tell me that it has become almost impossible during the past three years to get even tasteful mid-rise apartment projects approved in Toronto, as a populist, suburban mayor allows local residents to block anything. Montreal's blend of corruption and paralysis has prevented much-needed density growth. And even Vancouver, according to one report, still has more than 7,000 surplus parking spaces, and downtown development is now stagnant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet we need it more than ever. The Vancouverist ideology solves a number of serious problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First is sprawl: According to a recent projection, the population of the Greater Toronto Area will rise from six million today to almost 10 million in the next 28 years. Vancouver will go from 2.2 million to 3.4 million in the same period. Most of those people intend to move downtown or into inner-ring suburbs. But if housing there is in short supply, they'll push out into the outskirts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second is the housing shortage: If we cannot increase the supply of housing, and at least double the population density of our big cities, then our children will have little chance of becoming homeowners. If foreign investors buy the new condos, all the better. We even more seriously need an increase in rental stock, to push down rents and give people an urban entry point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And third is quality of life: That doubling of density isn't just needed – it's highly desirable. With twice as many people per square kilometre, there will be sufficiently large markets (and tax bases) to justify subway lines, parks and cultural venues. At the moment, density-increasing development is being blocked in the neighbourhoods that most need these things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not just governments. Canadian city-dwellers need to adopt a Vancouverist mindset. I'll never understand why downtown homeowners, who often rail against the horrors of farmland-destroying, carbon-speawing urban sprawl, then turn around and oppose midrise condominium projects in their own neighbourhoods. Not only do those developments add neighbours and thus demand for nice services and better schools and shops and transit routes, but they are the only solution to urban sprawl. You get one or you get the other. “Density,” writes the Vancouver developer Bob Ransford, who consulted on the Melbourne report, “is the antidote to sprawl.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We lived for six decades with sprawling outskirts and the anomie of parking-lot downtowns. Now that we're famous for inventing an alternative, it's time to embrace it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1038 Canada Place, Vancouver; 604-695-5300; orucuisine.com; Dinner appetizers, $8 to $18; entrées, $28 to $45; steak, $36 to $80; Cuisine: Pacific Rim.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stars: None</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oru in the Fairmont Pacific Rim is not surprisingly one of Vancouver's most expensive restaurants. From the custom-made Fazioli piano in the hotel's marble-clad lobby to the 50-metre-long origami sculpture illuminating its haute-Zen flagship eatery, every gleaming fixture in this waterfront property screams luxury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Extraordinary price points do however come with high expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A $90 lunch for two (before tip, without drinks or dessert) should dazzle. It didn't. A subsequent dinner – at which I was served lobster so soft and mushy it had to be sent back (twice), a Japanese seafood hotpot grossly muddled with Béarnaise sauce, and an otherwise exquisite chocolate marquis marred by plantain chutney so unexpectedly raw and starchy my friend actually spat it out – was an unconscionable flop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oru may have had problems in the past, but its new direction is a turn for the worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the restaurant launched three years ago, just days before the Winter Olympic Games began, David Wong was executive chef. A Bocuse d'Or top-10 finalist, he cooked up elevated street food from the Asian Pacific Rim. The house-made noodles in his Berkshire pork belly ramen may have sometimes fallen flat, but his almond butter chicken was out of this world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alas, homemade tofu was too cutting edge for this opulent hotel. Visiting guests didn't understand the modern Asian concept. Local foodies couldn't swallow the prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 18 months ago, Mr. Wong was replaced by Darren Brown, a well-travelled Vancouverite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brown had spent two years cruising the Mediterranean aboard Merv Griffin's private yacht before dropping anchor in Las Vegas, where he worked his way up to executive sous chef at Mix Restaurant (owned by the renowned Michelin three-star chef Alain Ducasse) and later, assistant executive chef of the entire <span class="companylink">Mandalay Bay Resort &amp; Casino</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recruited from the Glowbal Group, with which he spent almost three years upon returning to Vancouver, Mr. Brown has expanded Oru's Pacific Rim repertoire to its broadest possible definition, adding Mexico, South America and Polynesia to the stew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No longer just an Asian restaurant, although the tables are still oddly set with chopsticks, Oru is also a steakhouse (specializing in charbroiled angus reserve); an Italian trattoria (featuring ling cod puttanesca, veal osso buco and mushroom risotto from the hotel's casual Giovane Café); and a health spa, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(As with all Fairmont hotels and resorts, Oru offers an extensive lifestyle menu replete with low-carb, low-fat, vegetarian, vegan, Mediterranean, macrobiotic, gluten-free, heart-healthy, raw and diabetic options.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its attempt to be everything, Oru is spread too thin to excel at anything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I did enjoy a few memorable dishes over two visits, which makes me believe the kitchen harbours some serious talent that could be fostered with a tighter focus. Best of all was the Hawaiian-inspired, maple-mustard-glazed kalua pork belly, thinly sliced yet thickly streaked with fat as silky as its pineapple-scented bed of lotus root purée.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japanese-influenced cuisine would appear, at first bite, to be Oru's greatest strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Creamy salmon chowder, thickened with leek and potato in a bacon-dashi fish stock, was deeply sweet and smoky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lunchtime bento box was generously filled with Dungeness crab, lobster, scallop, steelhead and albacore tuna rolled around various forms of rice, a lovely piece of maple-glazed pork belly and the sweet bean curd skins. Mind you, at $28 – nearly twice the price of the average bento box – it should be good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as I was wondering why Oru doesn't offer more Japanese dishes, along came the saffron nabemono. A rarefied version of the all-in-one comfort hotpot, the bowl bobbed with mussels, and salmon and sablefish and tuna. On the side, looking like a a wannabe bouillabaisse aoili, was a piece of toast topped with crab smothered in Béarnaise sauce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If I wanted a buttery egg-yolk steak sauce with my crab, I would have ordered the filet mignon Oscar, or a bouillabaisse. Besides the fact that that sauce wasn't even mentioned on the menu, it was just wrong for a delicate dashi broth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It curdled into slimy clumps and overpowered everything else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Poached coconut lobster was another disaster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shelled claws and tail arrived on a bed of overcooked Israeli cous-cous (insipidly infused with cilantro) looking shrunken and wilted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was no snap to the flesh. The waiter took it back, but the second order wasn't any better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chef Brown, who obviously hadn't tasted the lobster before it left the kitchen, didn't argue with me. He knew, belatedly, exactly what was wrong. There was too much lime in the poaching liquid, he explained. Even though the lobster was cooked for only 1½ minutes, the citrus acids had broken down the protein. “Not a great time to figure it out,” he apologized. No, sadly not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What else? Spicy coconut-corn chowder had no hint of jalapeno and the tomato-guajillo sauce served with gaucho steak frites was meek.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, chili-broccolini was a bludgeoning scorcher. In general, the kitchen's use of spice lacks balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wagyu beef tartare was a disappointing attempt at innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The under-seasoned, roughly chopped meat was bedecked with an oyster in place of the standard quail's egg. It had the right slippery texture, but it was warm and had no flavour. There was nothing in the mix to bind or brighten the meat. A watercress purée tasted like, well, water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With only one white wine bottle listed for less than $60, we ordered individual glasses. Neither arrived until we had finished our two staggered appetizers and were working on our main courses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Oru were less expensive, it would merit a star. But at these prices – which rank right up there with the Bluewater Café and Cioppino's – there's no excuse for anything less than excellence. Oru is far from excellent and I cannot recommend it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apparently, it isn't enough for Doug Ford that his brother won an appeal of a court ruling ousting him from office over conflict-of-interest allegations. No, he wants pay back. His target: Integrity Commissioner Janet Leiper.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The councillor says, “If it was up to me, I'd ask her to step down. Through her lack of due diligence, she has almost destroyed a family.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The court case, he says, “had major ramifications for my brother. It hurt his family, it hurt him financially, it hurt his kids and most of all, it hurt the city.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says the least Ms. Leiper can do is apologize. Deputy Mayor Doug Holyday echoed that call on the floor of city council, arguing the affair had “caused great consternation and great expense for Mayor Ford” and “almost cost us a mayor.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These attacks are grossly unfair to Ms. Leiper, a straight-arrow public servant who was only trying to uphold the rules when she pursued a complaint against Mr. Ford for violating city council's code of conduct. She found that he was offside when he used his status as a city councillor to raise money for his football foundation, which accepted donations from lobbyists and a company that does business with the city government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Rob Ford had listened to her repeated warnings and simply followed the code of conduct, he could have made the whole thing go away. Instead, he stubbornly ignored her. Only then did the matter come before city council, which ordered him to pay back around $3,000 in improper donations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The initial judge in the case ruled that council was within its rights to do so. The appeal court, looking again at the complex web of law that governs council's powers, disagreed. If council was acting outside its powers when it ordered the mayor to return the donated money, it ruled, then he could not have been in conflict of interest when he voted on the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does this mean Ms. Leiper should bow her head and say sorry? Of course not. A lawyer and former law professor, she was applying the code of conduct as she read it and seeking a proper penalty for someone who was refusing to comply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is a new area of law that evolves and requires being tested in court,” Councillor Gord Perks reminded council on Thursday after Mr. Holyday called for an apology. Two courts rendered two different decisions, “indicating the areas were complex and difficult enough, Mr. Deputy Mayor, that even judges disagreed.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If anyone made a mistake, Mr. Perks said, it was not Ms. Leiper but Mr. Ford, who “took money from lobbyists for a charity that bore his name. That was the egregious error, that is the root cause of all the consternation, all the difficulty, all the legal fees, all the conflict, all the newspaper headlines.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, exactly. In fact, as Ms. Leiper notes, the appeal court's ruling does not overturn her finding that Mr. Ford violated the code of conduct in the first place. It says only that council was wrong to impose a financial penalty on him for violating it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of rapping Ms. Leiper's knuckles, councillors should thank their stars for having such a good shepherd. Ms. Leiper's office grew out of the computer-leasing scandal more than a decade ago that put a shadow over city council's integrity. In response, council drew up tough new ethics rules and brought in “accountability officers,” including an integrity commissioner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a strict regime and it can be a hassle for councillors, who are often confused by the rules. One councillor, James Pasternak, complained that they are being “shrink-wrapped.” But in an age of deep distrust of politicians, those hassles are a small price to pay. Far better to be too strict than too lax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Ms. Leiper herself told councillors on Thursday, “you have set yourself a very high bar.” When they approved the new integrity rules, they said to the public, “Not only will we be accountable to the law, not only will we be accountable to the electorate at election time, we are adding an extra layer of ethical accountability” – a code of conduct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enforcing that code is her job. She shouldn't have to apologize for doing it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freedom to Read Week begins on Feb. 24, bringing with it the perfect opportunity to kick the tires of democracy and make sure the old jalopy's still running as she should.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's that you say? The bumper fell off when you touched it? The engine won't turn over? That's not so good. Better look under the hood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We like to think of censorship as something that happens over there, in the faraway places where men break into houses at night to smash computers, or arrive in classrooms to remove books they don't like. Not in lovely, calm, respectful Canada. Here we don't necessarily notice freedoms being eroded slowly, grain by grain, “like sands through the hourglass,” if you'll allow me to quote from Days of Our Lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just ask <span class="companylink">Canada's government</span> scientists. Oh wait, you can't ask them, because they've got duct tape over their mouths (metaphorical duct tape, but hey – it's still painful). This week the University of Victoria's Environmental Law Clinic and <span class="companylink">Democracy Watch</span> asked federal Information Commissioner Suzanne Legault to investigate claims that scientists are being prohibited from speaking freely with journalists – and through them, the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report called Muzzling Civil Servants: A Threat to Democracy, the UVic researchers present some chilling findings: Scientists are either told not to speak to journalists or to spout a chewed-over party line, rubber-stamped by their PR masters; the restrictions are particularly tight when a journalist is seeking information about research relating to climate change or the tar sands; <span class="companylink">Environment Canada</span> scientists require approval from the <span class="companylink">Privy Council Office</span> before speaking publicly on sensitive topics “such as climate change or protection of polar bear and caribou.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You wouldn't want the average citizen to learn too much about caribou, now. It could lead to panel discussions about Arctic hares, town halls on ptarmigans. The report states that government scientists are “frustrated,” which is hardly surprising. It's like hiring Sandy Koufax and never letting him pitch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other thing the report makes clear is how deliberate this strategy is: “The federal government has recently made concerted efforts to prevent the media – and through them, the general public – from speaking to government scientists, and this, in turn, impoverishes the public debate on issues of significant national concern.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not an issue that's going away. The Harper government's heavy-handed control of scientists' research has raised concerns across the world for a few years, including condemnation from such bastions of Marxism as Nature magazine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A couple thousand scientists from across the country marched on Parliament Hill last July to protest cuts in research (many in the highly sensitive area of environment and climate change) and restrictions on their ability to speak freely about their work. They created what might be the best chant in the history of political protest: “What do we want? Science! When do we want it? After peer review!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Margaret Munro of Postmedia News reported that a <span class="companylink">University of Delaware</span> scientist was up in arms over a new confidentiality agreement brought in by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. “I'm not signing it,” Andreas Muenchow told the reporter. What does this mean for bilateral co-operation on research? Nothing good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Vise-Grip on information is tightening and Ottawa is the muscle. Last month, <span class="companylink">Canadian Journalists for Free Expression</span> released a report about the dire state of freedom of information requests: “Canada's access to information system is in a deep crisis and without urgent reform could soon become dysfunctional,” the report noted. That means fewer requests being processed, at a more glacial pace, with more of the juicy bits blacked out by the government censor's pen. This is the good stuff, people. The stuff the government doesn't want you to know about. The stuff that's kept in a filing cabinet in Gatineau under a sign that says, “Nothing here. Nope. Just a three-week-old tuna sandwich. And it's radioactive.” This is the information we need to keep an eye on the government's internal gears – and it's being withheld.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada recently plummeted 10 places to No. 20 in the World Press Freedom Index, which measures how unfettered a country's media is. <span class="companylink">Reporters Without Borders</span>, which compiles the index, is concerned about the access-to-information issue and about the protection of journalists' sources. The beacon we should now follow is Jamaica, whose press freedoms rank highest in the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the perfect time to welcome Freedom to Read Week. There are events all over Canada and countless ways to celebrate our precious liberties. Bring your kids to the library. Read something you shouldn't. Even better, write something you shouldn't. A letter to your MP, perhaps?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1952, I was fortunate enough to win a debating contest at West Vancouver High – “fortunate” because the prize was a trip to Ottawa to see Parliament. The sponsor was the local MP, James Sinclair, then a powerful politician but now remembered mainly as the father of Margaret Trudeau.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sinclair kindly arranged some visits with parliamentarians, most memorably with one of the most important men in Ottawa. Jack Pickersgill was a former backroom fixer for Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King and a newly minted cabinet minister in the Louis St. Laurent government. I was told I could ask the great man one question only, so I gave it my best shot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What,” I asked, “is the purpose of the Senate?” I well remember his reply. Pick, as he was universally known, drew himself up to his full height of 5 foot 6 or so and said to me with his nasal twang: “Young man, the Senate is a humane garbage disposal.” More kindly, he went on to explain that cabinet deadwood had to be cleared out for new timber, and a Senate post was a sort of golden parachute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is much more to the Senate than that, as I came to learn over years in politics and especially while researching and writing the report Challenges in Senate Reform in 2004. There have been and are excellent senators. The Red Chamber has tackled so many difficult issues that elected politicians dared not touch – early discussion of marijuana legalization and real reform to medicare, for example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has forced elections when prime ministers arguably moved too quickly – as in the case of the 1988 free-trade election. Current abortion law (or lack thereof) is a Senate creation. When John Diefenbaker arbitrarily fired Bank of Canada governor James Coyne, the Senate called the prime minister to account. And Brian Mulroney could only get his reviled Goods and Services Tax through Parliament by stacking the Senate (as the Constitution allowed him to do) with temporary appointments. But it is in committees, caucus and the back rooms where most of the work is done. For better or for worse – mostly for better – the Senate has had a profound if mostly unseen impact on Canadian governance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is exactly as the framers of our Constitution intended. They wanted an upper house, common to virtually all federations like Canada, to be influential but not dominant. We do not have in Canada the deadlocks that are so common south of the border, where there are two elected chambers. And the framers wanted an upper house that would be more thoughtful, less partisan and less moved by the popular emotion of the day. They got both those things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today many would-be Senate reformers really want to attack two of the evils of our federation, namely insufficient oversight of an all-powerful Prime Minister by the people's representatives and sometimes inadequate regional representation. They see the Senate as the best and easiest place to achieve these worthy goals, but it is neither.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have the wrong target. The Senate is effectively impossible to reform properly – i.e., changing the number of seats per province – and merely making it elected would be a disaster. Election would confer democratic legitimacy. And then the overwhelming numerical dominance of Quebec and the Atlantic provinces would turn the Senate into a one-way conveyor belt of money from the richer parts of Canada. Plus, a “democratic” Senate would feel empowered to block the House, yielding blackmail and/or deadlock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compare the two chambers. The Senate costs about one penny per day per Canadian, the House about four times as much. The Senate does better committee work by far. House committees are nothing but an extension of Commons warfare, so apparent in the silliness of Question Period. The Senate is less partisan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The place to reform is the House. Prime Minister Stephen Harper can make it happen because at the moment, through iron party discipline, he controls everything in the Commons. This newspaper has just completed a series detailing various reforms. These would empower MPs (and therefore those of us who elect them), give genuine representation and constrain the Prime Minister.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's on.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the Courtney Campbell Causeway, in Tampa, Curtis Granderson's right forearm was broken on Sunday by a pitch from the <span class="companylink">Toronto Blue Jays</span>' split-squad starter, J.A. Happ. The <span class="companylink">New York Yankees</span> hit Brett Lawrie in the shoulder in the next inning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back at Florida Auto Exchange Stadium, the <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span> contemplated the return of Boston Red Sox manager John Farrell on Monday. The <span class="companylink">Red Sox</span> will play split-squad games in Port Charlotte, Fla., against the <span class="companylink">Tampa Bay Rays</span> and in Dunedin, Fla., against the <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span>. Farrell is expected to accompany the Dunedin-bound squad, which will face starter R.A. Dickey for two innings followed by Josh Johnson for another two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farrell will find that Jose Bautista will seek him out to shake his hand, that J.P. Arencibia will gladly say “hi” to him if the two cross paths, and that Adam Lind will say hello “if he's close to me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I won't seek him out,” Lind, the <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span>' designated hitter, said Sunday as Toronto was being beaten 5-4 by the <span class="companylink">Baltimore Orioles</span>. “I'm sure we'll all be professional out there … it will be, uh, interesting to see what happens. I don't think he'll be looking for us.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was shortly after making his comments about Farrell that the clubhouse television sets, which were tuned to the <span class="companylink">YES Network</span>'s telecast of the <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span> and Yankees, reported that Granderson will be out for 10 weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pitching in front of manager John Gibbons and general manager Alex Anthopoulos, Happ hit Granderson, who led the Yankees with 43 home runs last season, with a 2-2 fastball in what would turn into a 2-0 <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span> win.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The [crap's] already started,” Lind said, his lips pursed in a tight smile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his first game since his season ended in August with a wrist injury, Bautista slugged a long, two-run home run, and Sergio Santos, who is on the verge of regaining his closer's job, needed six pitches to get two fly outs and a grounder in his first action since April of 2012. Those are two welcome returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farrell? Not so much after he forced the <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span> to trade him to the <span class="companylink">Red Sox</span> with a year left on his contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farrell's departure was as ham-handed as his managing in 2012, when he oversaw a team that came off the rails due to injuries and a lack of discipline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over-the-top bitterness toward departing players is a fact of the twisted existence of Toronto sports fans. On the surface, this should be like having Vince Carter or Chris Bosh play in your local high school gymnasium just a few months after stiffing the Raptors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But considering the church-like quiet of the snowbirds in attendance here, Monday's game will be a happy hunting ground for any leather-lung looking to have the stage to himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some players will be more welcoming than Lind. Arencibia knows that it was Farrell who gave him the opportunity to be a full-time catcher. And Bautista said: “As a person I like him. As a manager I like him. He never did anything bad or wrong to me. You can't blame anybody for having a desire to get to a certain place in his career. He had a chance to pursue his dream, and I would rather him being there doing that than being with us and wanting to be there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So, we'll have normal chit-chat and then I'm going to try and kick his ass.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lind was asked if the page has been turned with Farrell. He shrugged. “It is for him because he wanted to be in Boston anyway. He has no love lost.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truth is, Monday for Farrell will be all about starting to tie up loose ends with uniformed personnel. “He had all our phone numbers,” Lind said. The fans will never forgive him – make book on that – but he won't know the full extent of their bitterness until the <span class="companylink">Red Sox</span> are at the Rogers Centre April 5-7. That will be nasty and brutish.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I travel this great land of ours, in search of insight, common sense and sometimes in search of the Brother when he goes dipsy-doodling, people I meet tend to tell me what they watch on TV. When they meet the Brother they tend to tell him to quit bothering them or stop smiling in that geeky way at their sister. But that's another story.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years a lot of people have told me how much they enjoy Murdoch Mysteries (CBC, 9 p.m.). For a time, the remarks tended to be about the mysterious disappearance of the show from the CITY-TV schedule and the even deeper mystery of when it might return. Now the show is a CBC property, airs every Monday and boy, is it going strong. What's the continuing allure? Let's investigate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tonight's episode – we're now at season six, episode seven – is called The Ghost of Queen's Park, and apparently originated from an idea by the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario, David C. Onley, who also makes a brief appearance. The setting for much of the action is Queen's Park, the Ontario Legislature, which, when it isn't prorogued, usually features MPPs droning on and on about cancelled gas plants in Oakville and Mississauga and provincial Conservative leader Tim Hudak demanding an election today, tomorrow or at the very latest, Friday evening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As things open tonight it's quiet at Queen's Park. There's an elderly chap there, at night, doing paperwork. He hears a noise. A night watchman hears something too. Elderly chap thinks it's the night watchman. Night watchman thinks it's the elderly chap. Next thing you know, the elderly chap is dead and the watchman is making speeches to the police about “the ghosts of Queen's Park. Lady ghosts, one and all.” This turn of events impresses the officer taking statements at the scene, the charming naif Constable George Crabtree (Jonny Harris). He takes the view that the dead man, the MPP for Toronto East, was poleaxed by a ghost. Our hero, the cool, sensible Detective Murdoch (Yannick Bisson) is less sure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He puts the ghost theory to his boss, the eternally dyspeptic Inspector Thomas Brackenreid (Thomas Craig), who scoffs and declares, “I always thought Queen's Park was full of happy dafties!” To which Murdoch replies: “Happy dafties?” And Brackenreid clarifies by barking, “Crackpots!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along comes a journalist who says he has the dirt on the dead MPP. Land dealings and such. Numbered companies. Murdoch Mysteries might be set at the end of the 19th century, but some things obviously never change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyway. It is asserted that Queen's Park is crawling with ghosties, including “a maiden in a checkered dress who pulls it up over her head to conceal her face.” Crabtree interviews the typists at Queen's Park, one of whom asserts that the night watchman “isn't quite the full tin of biscuits.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stuff happens. A senior figure in the Ontario government is questioned by Murdoch and Brackenreid about the death. He sees this as impertinence – “Do you know who I am?” he asks rhetorically. “I'll have your badges!” And Murdoch and Brackenreid manage to keep a straight face while resisting the temptation to reply, “Badges? We don't need no stinking badges!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crabtree won't let go of the ghost theory and corrals the comely Dr. Emily Grace (Georgina Reilly) into helping him. As it happens, even though Crabtree is oblivious, Emily is as flirty as all get out. When she says she has enjoyed “metaphysical excursions to the other side,” you get the feeling she's talking about you-know-what. Nudge, nudge. Or maybe she isn't. Anyhoo – her and Crabtree. Mark my words.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also a situation involving Murdoch and Dr. Julia Ogden (Hélène Joy), which is fraught with meaning that I failed to grasp because I haven't seen every episode of this season. But that's okay. And that's all I'm saying about the plot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Murdoch Mysteries sells a lot on DVD and the distributor says, “The charming hit mystery series combines the period appeal of Sherlock Holmes with the forensic fascination of CSI.” That doesn't do it justice, at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show is so deftly done, it's a little masterpiece of tone and style. Sure, it's about Murdoch the isolated man-of-the-future stuck in a very antiquated place, but it is full of mischief and never becomes a stuffy period piece. Nor does it become pompous about science and forensics. Its lightness is its secret. It is often on the verge of comedy – Jonny Harris is just wicked as the babe-in-the-woods Crabtree and Thomas Craig is clearly having a whale of a time as Brackenreid. It's fabulous froth.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Snitching on an aging neighbour or relative about their poor driving is not the most effective way to improve road safety. Sudbury should reconsider a program that targets senior citizens in an effort to get them off the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The initiative, known as The North East Dementia Network Coalition Safe Driving Task Force, feeds into negative stereotypes about older drivers. The anonymous tips are funnelled through Crime Stoppers; police follow up by dispatching a plainclothes officer to the home of the offending driver to discuss their performance at the wheel.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are plenty of drivers out there of every age and description. Why single out seniors? Why not encourage people to report teenagers who drive recklessly, or a person of any age who gets behind the wheel while intoxicated?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Statistics show seniors are less likely to be involved in crashes (in part because they drive less). They are, however, second only to new drivers in their fatality rates, due to their increased frailty. Many older people, especially women, already avoid road trips and busy highways as well as taking out the car during rush hour or at night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulations in most parts of Canada require doctors to report patients who are likely to be a hazard on the road. Many provinces, including Ontario, require people to undergo medical screening when they reach a certain age, as well as cognitive and written driving tests if necessary. These programs are a less arbitrary way to enhance road safety. Provinces could consider offering remedial driving courses to help older motorists adjust to slower response times and reduced vision. Florida, for example, has larger street signs and enhanced lighting to accommodate its large population of seniors. “I hardly think police should be used for family counselling. If you care enough about your parent, you're going to have to buck up and be honest with them,” said Susan Eng, vice-president for advocacy at the Canadian Association for Retired People.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the population ages, the issue of how to assist senior motorists to adapt, and even to plan for life without a car, will become increasingly important. But it is vital to remember that many older people are competent drivers. If they aren't, tests and impartial screening by professionals are the best ways to help them accept this. Safety campaigns should be directed at the problem of dangerous driving period – not at snitching on a single demographic.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first order of business this week in the B.C. legislature is a debate on Bill 2, the law to reinstate the provincial sales tax. It ensures that the Liberal government's millstone that is the harmonized sales tax is finally lifted two weeks before the election campaign begins. It means the provincial sales tax, as in the past, won't apply to items such as restaurant meals, movie tickets and haircuts. But Finance Minister Mike de Jong expects no chorus of angels to sing his praises – the Liberal government is only doing this because an angry public made it back down. And the main beneficiary of the HST, the business community, is cranky about the way it was brought back.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1996 election, the NDP staged a campaign that painted the Liberals as the party of Howe Street – big business. The NDP, naturally, represented the good hard-working folks of Main Street. Since the Liberals took office in 2001, they have done a pretty good job of playing their assigned role. Until now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The adoption of the HST was a shift of the tax burden from business to consumers. What is happening now as the B.C. Liberals prepare to face the electorate is a shift the other way. Ms. Clark said last week's budget was “balanced in every sense of the word.” It included a raft of tax hikes for business and high-income earners – a reversal of 12 years of Liberal policy. The Liberals argue they have done enough to improve the investment climate with tax cuts over the years, and the folks on Howe Street can now afford to cough up a little more. But the complaints from industry about the Liberal government are mounting – perhaps the relationship has soured. “This is an inopportune time to be adding to the tax burden facing business and industry in British Columbia,” said Jock Finlayson, chief economist for the B.C. Business Council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is nothing in here to address the competitive nature of our economy that will create the kind of growth that is needed to pay the bills,” said John Winter of the B.C. Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it is not just the PST and the budget. The oil and gas sector is unhappy with the threat to impose a new tax on the proposed liquefied natural gas industry. The film industry mounted a social-media attack on the Premier's <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page in a bid for more tax credits. <span class="companylink">Catalyst Paper Corp</span>. CEO Kevin Clarke gleefully posed with NDP Leader Adrian Dix at the Toronto Stock Exchange last month, after the Liberal government left the financially troubled company to flounder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mining sector is fuming about a decision by the Clark government to kill the proposed Morrison copper and gold mine. In a speech last week, the head of the Mining Association of Canada raked the Liberals over the coals: “How did the government come to the conclusion that the risks outweighed the benefits? Frankly, we don't know. What we do know is this uncertainty is not good for investment.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as the corporate community vents about the Clark government, business leaders are making an effort to blur the lines that defined election campaigns past. Greg D'Avignon, president of the Business Council of B.C., is organizing a conference on how B.C. can do a better job at sharing the province's wealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. D'Avignon ran Gordon Campbell's campaign in the last election. But now he wants to dial down the polarized rhetoric that is the hallmark of this province's election campaigns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That family earning between $30,000 and $80,000 hasn't felt like they have participated in economic prosperity in the last little while,” he said in an interview. “How can we share that prosperity in a more meaningful way?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The case for shared prosperity echoes the arguments advanced by Don Wright, the former head of the B.C. Institute of Technology who has recently quit to help the NDP prepare for a possible transition to government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With all this muddy crossover, the script for the 2013 election campaign cannot be a battle between Howe Street and Main Street.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Harper has done everything from playing the piano in public to tweeting a prime minister's day to soften his austere persona. Then came the meeting earlier this month with Darcie Clark, whose former husband killed their three children.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Afterward, talking with reporters, Mr. Harper at first found it difficult to speak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Once you become a parent, you see the world through a different lens,” he explained, his voice growing increasingly unsteady. “Given the love we all have for our children, one cannot begin to imagine the pain and suffering that this kind of event brings about.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moment passed, and the Prime Minister went on to promote new Conservative legislation that would make it more difficult for those found not guilty of crimes through mental illness to be released.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the least-understood qualities of this complex politician is the shield he uses to protect himself from the public, a defence that so rarely slips.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A lot of his persona has been misinterpreted, because he is an introvert by nature,” offers John Weissenberger, a long-time friend of the Prime Minister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Someone who is by nature a reserved person is often seen as cold and unfeeling,” he explained in an interview. “But there are glimpses. When you see him meeting with families who have suffered personal loss … he shows that he can be deeply moved by things.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aaron Pincus is a psychologist at Pennsylvania State University who has, among other things, examined introversion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Being an introvert doesn't mean that you lack some skill that you should have,” he said in an interview. “I don't see introversion as the same as being shy or socially anxious.” Instead, it marks “a preference for a certain interpersonal distance,” he said. Introverts gain strength from having time to themselves, while an extrovert draws energy from being with others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet from an introvert's contemplation can emerge powerful convictions. Stephen Harper came of age during the era of Reagan and Thatcher, in the last decade of the Cold War, and drew from those experiences permanent lessons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the reasons he ran for public office, Mr. Harper said at the press conference, was that he believed “profoundly” that the criminal justice system had “become unbalanced in a way that was really inexcusable.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harper also believes, said Mr. Weissenberger, that Canadians had lost touch with their past, especially their military past; that foreign policy was, as Mr. Harper puts it, too willing to “go along to get along;” that the federal government had become too intrusive in the affairs of the provinces and the lives of the people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However you may regard these convictions, you cannot question the depth of them. “He wouldn't be in politics if it weren't for his philosophical beliefs,” Mr. Weissenberger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prof. Pincus acknowledges that introverts can have a harder time getting ahead. “People prefer interacting with extroverts more than introverts,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Extroverts, controlling for everything else, do better on job interviews or admissions interviews or getting-elected interviews.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if an introvert can make it into public office, he or she can bring qualities that extroverts lack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Introverts are more likely to be able to make the tough decision because they don't need everybody to be their friend,” he explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And because the public can sense how difficult it is for an introvert to run for office, they may trust his or her judgment more than an extrovert, whom voters may suspect is just in it for the applause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean that Stephen Harper's vision for the country is the right vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it does help explain how a man whose smile is demonstrably forced, who would rather be filmed working alone in his office than working a crowd, whose defences crack only when confronted with the raw grief of a mother whose children have been taken from her, can win three consecutive elections.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As bicentennial commemorations for the War of 1812 continue, as Black History Month winds down and as <span class="companylink">the UN</span> International Decade for People of African Descent commences, it is shocking, surprising and curious that the black Canadian perspective and the African contribution to this conflict are largely ignored.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is shocking because even John Graves Simcoe, the first lieutenant-governor of Ontario (then Upper Canada), noted that he would not discriminate by “dishonest policy between the natives of Africa, America or Europe.” It is surprising because even Wellington County has a good exhibit on this. And it is curious because a rich visual snippet by way of a new Heritage Minute from The Historica-Dominion Institute focuses on the dramatic historical narrative of Richard Pierpoint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pierpoint's story offers an excellent example of the black military contribution. It also speaks to an essential narrative in black Canadian history that belongs among the lessons of the War of 1812 bicentennial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pierpoint was born around 1744 in Bondu, West Africa (now Senegal). He was captured at 16 and, like so many young, strong Africans, enslaved. Upon his arrival in the Americas, he became property of a British military officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the outbreak of the American War of Independence, Pierpoint accepted military duty to achieve his freedom. Following his service in Butler's Rangers, he, like thousands of other Black Loyalists, was granted land in Canada. In Ontario, these veterans helped to settle Niagara Falls and Niagara-on-the-Lake; they also settled parts of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Pierpoint worked 200 acres near Twelve Mile Creek in Ontario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The threat of re-enslavement in 1812 thrust African-Canadians into action. As Pierpoint says to a British officer in the Heritage Minute: “Your officers fight for land and money. I fight for my freedom.” He petitioned the government to form and lead a “corps of men of colour.” The unit was eventually formed under the direction of a retired white officer as Captain Runchey's Company of Coloured Men. It was the first all-black unit in Upper Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Coloured Corps, as it was also known, fought key battles, including Fort George, Stoney Creek, St. Davids and Lundy's Lane. They were among the first reinforcements at Queenston to help take back the Heights. As many as 20 per cent of combatants in the war were black, many in the naval forces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the war, black defenders were granted land in the remote Oro area. The land was difficult to clear and cultivate; many left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1821, Pierpoint again petitioned the government, this time for passage back to Senegal. Instead, at 77, he was granted 100 acres near present-day Fergus, Ont. He died, impoverished, about 1838. But his story – from free-born in Africa to enslaved in the New World, from soldier to settler – provides a rare personal narrative that helps us understand the experiences of Black Loyalists and how this period led to Canada's identification as a land of freedom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The War of 1812 showed that Canada was a place where black people were effectively free under the law; where black settlements – the highest mark of freedom – created community. Living free “under the lion's paw” was possible even as slavery continued to the south. As black veterans sought to reunite with family in the United States, their stories about stirred the imaginations of thousands more. In this way, the promise of the Underground Railroad was born of the War of 1812.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s general managers gather on March 21 in Toronto for an abbreviated version of their annual meetings one thing is certain – they will recommend increased use of video replay in overturning or confirming the decisions of the on-ice officials.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The appetite for more replay use than the current standard, which sees the league's hockey department review only goals and only whether or not the puck entered the net, is much greater than it was in November, 2010, when <span class="companylink">Florida Panthers</span> GM Dale Tallon saw his suggestion of giving coaches one challenge a game, like the NFL, quickly rejected. Now the debate will concern just how intrusive the war room at the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> offices in Toronto will be with the referees and just how those rulings will be applied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm more open than I was when Dale Tallon brought it up,” <span class="companylink">Detroit Red Wings</span> GM Ken Holland said Sunday. “The big thing in our game is goals, so we have to try to make sure goals are right, that we're not scoring goals on offsides or maybe goalie interference.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tallon, who made his proposal shortly after his team lost a game to the <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span> when forward Colton Orr knocked down Panthers' goaltender Scott Clemmensen and put the puck in off his skate, saw his argument boosted last week by <span class="companylink">Colorado Avalanche</span> forward Matt Duchene. He was offside by a metre when he scored to help the Avalanche beat the <span class="companylink">Nashville Predators</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But the question will be where you draw the line and what to include,” said Maple Leafs vice-president of hockey operations Dave Poulin. “I think it's got its place because you always want the right call.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change in attitude probably came with the growing sentiment you hear behind the scenes now, that the game is too fast for the officials to call properly. This is not an indictment of the referees and the linesmen, simply the realization that the rule changes of the past eight years designed to speed up the game have done their job too well along with the players' dedication to training and fitness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With today's technology, every decision by the referees and linesmen could be subject to video review. However, the main concern with the GMs is the game is already subject to enough momentum-killing television timeouts and cannot stand much more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The problem is, if you try to take human error out of this we're going to slow down to a crawl,” Holland said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most popular solution appears to be what Tallon suggested back in 2010 – give each coach one challenge and limit it to goals. If an offside goal is scored or a penalty was missed just before a goal then it can be reversed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You could be over-saturating [the game] but I think in some situations, if it's the right call or the wrong call, let's go to it,” said Leafs head coach Randy Carlyle about more use of replay in general. “There's no reason to have a bunch of mistakes determine success or failure.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also up for discussion will be injury prevention, particularly as it relates to a couple of serious cuts to Erik Karlsson of the <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span> and Zach Redmond of the <span class="companylink">Winnipeg Jets</span>. However, do not expect the GMs to recommend the mandatory use of Kevlar socks under their uniforms to prevent skate cuts, as resistance from the players is always a problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Poulin thinks an enterprising manufacturer may solve this problem. He thinks it's only a matter of time before someone figures out how to make the uniform socks out of Kevlar or some other material that will protect players from cuts.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MALKIN CONCUSSed?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Pittsburgh Penguins</span> downplayed a report Evgeni Malkin suffered concussion symptoms after he was pushed into the boards by Erik Gudbranson of the <span class="companylink">Florida Panthers</span> during a game Friday. However, Malkin did not practice Saturday and was unable to play in Sunday's game against the <span class="companylink">Tampa Bay Lightning</span>. The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, citing multiple sources, reported Malkin suffered from severe headaches and mild disorientation, which was disputed by Penguins head coach Dan Bylsma. According to the team's website, Bylsma said Malkin is still being evaluated under the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s concussion protocol but he did say a concussion has not been ruled out. “We're waiting to see how he feels and reacts. He went into the boards pretty darn hard. We're not expecting any timeline to the injury or anything,” Bylsma said. Malkin hit the boards at full speed and lay on the ice for several minutes but managed to get to the dressing room under his own power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HYBRID ICING NOT DEAD</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the <span class="companylink">American Hockey League</span> decided to discontinue its trial of the hybrid icing rule last month, it might have given the impression the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> decided against adopting it as a safety measure. However, Toronto Maple Leafs vice-president of hockey operations Dave Poulin thinks the rule has a chance of being revived at the March 21 NHL general managers' meetings. He said it's “a good rule” and was only dropped by the AHL because it and the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> did not want players playing under two different rules, which might cause problems when they are promoted to the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>. The hybrid icing call has been studied for several years now as a way to avoid the high-speed collisions that can result from the chase for the puck. It gives the linesman the discretion to stop the play if he thinks the defending player will get to the puck first or it will be a tie by the time the puck reaches the faceoff dots. If he thinks the offensive player has a chance to reach the puck first the linesman can let play continue.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was so awestruck by the beauty of the land and the beauty of the sea that I was convinced we should create Pacific Rim National Park Reserve – and in 1970, I invited Princess Anne to dedicate the park,” Mr. Chrétien recalled in 2003, when, as prime minister, he returned to B.C., intent on saving another, very different piece of wilderness. On that visit, 10 years ago, Mr. Chrétien signed a memorandum of understanding with Gordon Campbell, then B.C.'s premier, calling for the creation of a new national park in the stunning desert landscape of the South Okanagan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Nature is part of our Canadian identity, part of our Canadian soul,” Mr. Chrétien said at the signing ceremony. “We need to show reverence for nature. We need to be trustees of nature. With this announcement, we are doing both.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, not quite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade later, Mr. Chrétien's dream of an Okanagan national park, to protect the pine forests and natural grasslands near Keremeos and Osoyoos, remains unfulfilled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was delay after delay, in a large part because timid B.C. politicians were cowed by the opposition of area ranchers and by noisy all-terrain vehicle clubs. And the deal just never got done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2012, with Mr. Chrétien and Mr. Campbell both gone from the political scene, the province of B.C. announced that the proposed park was off the table, because of a lack of public support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A poll showed that 39 per cent of local residents like the idea, while 19 per cent were opposed. Most of the rest, 41 per cent, were undecided.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. Environment Minister Terry Lake said that with that kind of “tepid” support, his government was no longer interested in discussing a national park with Ottawa. But dreams of saving the wilderness don't die easily in Canada, especially in B.C., where the raw beauty of the landscape is powerful enough to move prime ministers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environmental groups have continued to lobby for creation of the park, but <span class="companylink">Parks Canada</span> has backed off, stating on its website that “it cannot proceed without the support of the government of British Columbia.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the issue will be revived, when the four Indian bands that make up the Okanagan Nation Alliance hold a press conference to announce the results of a year-long feasibility study into the park proposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bands aren't commenting in advance, but it is expected they will endorse a national park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Wow,” Osoyoos Mayor Stu Wells said when he was told about the planned press conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He knows native leaders in the Okanagan have been looking hard at the park proposal, and he's convinced they'll see what he sees – a huge economic opportunity, and a chance to save a remarkable piece of B.C. wilderness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I would think it's going to be favourable towards creation of the park,” he said. “That would be great. Oh, that would be the turning point.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ingrid Jarrett, chair of the Thompson Okanagan Tourism Association agreed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That would be very, very important,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With support growing in the Okanagan, it's likely B.C. politicians will finally realize that Mr. Chrétien was right, a decade ago, when he recognized the dwindling wilderness in the South Okanagan is well worth saving.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the late 1800s, a group of independent oil producers in Pennsylvania came up with a radical idea to foil their nemesis, John D. Rockefeller. The Standard Oil baron had tied up the railroads, stopping his fledgling rivals from getting their oil to market. So, the landlocked independents teamed up to build the world's first long-distance oil pipeline.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although their Tidewater pipeline was an engineering feat, it was ultimately futile as a competitive gambit. Before long, the irrepressible Rockefeller controlled Tidewater and almost every other U.S. pipeline, with a network from the Appalachian Basin to the Gulf of Mexico coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would be the same coast to which Canada's bitumen-bubbling oil producers are now desperate to pump their product through <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s proposed Keystone XL pipeline, the much-maligned conduit that threatens to launch a Canada-U.S. Cold War. If the oil companies can't ship raw Canadian resources using that 150-year-old technology, they will rely on an even older one – rail. And if not rail, they might just float their bitumen on barges down the Mississippi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Huckleberry Finn might have marvelled at this inventiveness, but it doesn't quite cut it as a 21st-century national strategy for wealth creation. Yet our frantic obsession with exporting minimally processed bitumen is sucking up all the oxygen in the national conversation. Getting Alberta's oil to market is “the most important economic issue” facing the country, says former federal cabinet minister Jim Prentice. There is “no more critical issue facing Canada today,” adds Enbridge chief executive Al Monaco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the most critical issue facing Canada today may just be figuring out why we find ourselves in this situation. Raw resources can be a tremendous source of income, but they are volatile, and we've always known that overreliance on them is a recipe for economic stuntedness. As Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney says: “Real wealth is built through innovation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Innovation is not wholly absent from Canada's oil patch. But it's hardly a first line of business. You'd think it would be a top priority, given the vexatious characteristics of Alberta bitumen, the oil sands' distressing environmental footprint and the Canadian industry's growing global image problem. Even in boom times, however, the Canadian oil and gas industry spends a piddling proportion of its revenues on research and development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could be that Barack Obama is only yanking our chain and has no intention of putting the kibosh on Keystone, in which case the bitumen bubble will have been nothing but Alison Redford's bad dream. But even then, the celebration wouldn't last long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span> predicted that the coming boom in global shale oil production could slash the price of crude by $50 (U.S.) a barrel over the next two decades. “One effect will be to cut the need for expensive, environmentally destructive extraction techniques like the Arctic and tar sands,” the head of PwC's oil and gas team told Reuters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would please those on Canada's professional left. They believe that what's bad for the oil sands would be good for unionized workers in Ontario, as if all that's needed to revitalize Canadian manufacturing is for the loonie to lose its petro-dollar status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the real issue facing Ontario is its failure to make the shift from making low-tech goods to advanced manufacturing, the only kind that can support middle-class wages. Governments have showered the industry with tens of billions of dollars trying to make Canadian firms more innovative, to little avail. Cash-strapped and fed up, federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty slashed R&amp;D tax credits in last year's budget. The result will be even less innovation, as domestic companies cut back and foreign-owned firms shift R&amp;D elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Canada's problem,” says Robert Atkinson, the author of Innovation Economics, “is that it's not Germany, which has a much better engineering innovation system, and it's not the U.S., which has a very good system of science-based entrepreneurship. You're mediocre in both.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One promising, albeit insufficient, proposal from a recent federally appointed panel is to make innovation capacity a top criterion in awarding defence contracts. Economic purists have dismissed the idea as industrial policy by another name. They're wrong, and need only to cast an eye on the <span class="companylink">U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</span> to see how the pros do it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As collective endeavours go, it surely beats bemoaning our bitumen bubble.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can the police freely enter your house without a search warrant if you happen to have left the front door unlocked? The answer to that rhetorical question is “No.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a decision last Wednesday concerning a cellphone, the Ontario Court of Appeal appears to have lost sight of the essential principles of the search-warrant requirement. Sir Edward Coke wrote in 1644, “A man's house is his castle.” Today, cellphones often have contents that are just as private as the things inside one's home – they are not inviolable, but part of a privacy that is only to be breached with due process.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a certain Kevin Fearon was arrested for armed robbery in 2009, his cellphone was found. It was not locked – no password was needed – but a police officer had to tap on the keyboard to get into it. In a dwelling, if an officer enters with a search warrant and sees a gun or something else relevant, in plain view, he or she has a right to seize it as evidence. But the text message and photographs that were inside Mr. Fearon's cellphone were not in plain view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Months later, another officer quite properly applied for and obtained a search warrant for the cellphone's contents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fearon did not deny committing a robbery, but he claimed he had used only an imitation handgun; the cellphone evidence was arguably relevant on this point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The police in this case did not behave outrageously or oppressively, but then again Mr. Fearon burst into tears and was quite co-operative after he was arrested. He gave a full, videotaped confession on the day of the offence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Court of Appeal held that the police can make a “cursory” examination of a cellphone's contents if they do not have a search warrant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By analogy, an officer who lacks a warrant would be able to open an unlocked front door, peek in, glance around and depart. That is not a clear or convincing middle way to deal with this issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The judges said they would not “carve out” a new exception to the law of search warrants. Recourse to the principles of search, however, would show that the argument made on Mr. Fearon's behalf was not a carve-out, but a reassertion of the essence of the warrant requirement.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's next budget is only nine days away. Alison Redford, the Premier, on a visit to Washington on the weekend (lobbying for the Keystone XL pipeline), said that the provincial government's priority will be diversification of the province's economy, rather than deficit reduction. Diversification has long been desirable, but Ms. Redford is apparently choosing the easier path of the uncertain prospects of a new industrial policy, instead of the painful clarity of spending cuts – let alone any hope of an unpopular but beneficial consumption tax.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Ms. Redford has acknowledged that Alberta has “a spending problem,” she and Doug Horner, the Minister of Finance, seem to be headed toward subsidies or tax preferences for sections of the “non-oil economy,” specifically agriculture, forestry, health research and green technology. It is difficult enough to diversify within the oil export business to markets outside the United States (even including Central and Eastern Canada). The measures intended to favour other sectors are not likely to be well-designed or fine-tuned in time for next week's budget, considering the Progressive Conservatives' hasty changes of course over the past several weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the current predicament, the Official Opposition, the Wildrose Party, does not emerge better than the Conservatives. To them, it seems the province's fiscal problem can be solved almost by spending cuts alone, especially in public-sector pay. At least the Conservatives are not so simplistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta Taxpayer Protection Act of 1995, enacted when Ralph Klein was premier, makes tax reform very difficult, because it requires approval by referendum of any provincial sales tax – even if income tax were to be correspondingly reduced, in order to make government revenue less volatile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every Alberta government within living memory has preached economic diversification, to prepare for the depletion of oil and gas, but little has been achieved. At this rate, things may have to become quite a lot worse, before they get better.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1930s, at the beginning of the Nazi persecution of the Jews, an influential Jewish leader wrote that the world was divided into two parts – “those places where Jews could not live, and those they could not enter.” Canada fell into the latter category. To the condemned Jews of Auschwitz, Canada had a unique meaning. It was the name given to the camp barracks where the gold, jewellery and clothing taken from inmates were stored. It represented life, luxury and salvation. It was also isolated and unreachable, as was Canada in the 1930s and 40s.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why Canada had arguably the worst record of any Western country in trying to save the doomed Jews of Europe is the subject of None Is Too Many, a book written 30 years ago by Harold Troper and me, and just reissued by the University of Toronto Press.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a story that shocked many Canadians who believed the myth that theirs was a country of immigrants with a long history of welcoming refugees and dissidents, a country that has always been in the forefront in accepting the world's dispossessed and oppressed and where racism and bigotry are foreign creations that play little role in Canadian history or the Canadian psyche.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a story of the old, scarcely recognizable Canada of the first half of the 20th century, a benighted, closed, xenophobic society in which minorities were barred from almost every sector of Canadian life. It was a Canada with immigration policies that were racist and exclusionary, a country blanketed by an oppressive anti-Semitism in which Jews were the pariahs of Canadian society, demeaned, despised and discriminated against. Worst of all, this had permeated the upper levels of the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span>, the decisions of which closed the country's doors to the desperate Jews of Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's Canada is far different – generous, open, decent, humane. Multiculturalism is now an integral part of Canadian policy and diversity is encouraged. Yet at a moment when intolerance seems to be the global growth industry of the new century, the lessons of None Is Too Many should not be ignored. Immigration and refugee policies still divide Canadians. There remain significant pockets of discrimination and racism. Nazi war criminals and collaborators, thousands of whom were welcomed into this country immediately after the war, still live freely among us. Clearly, we still have much left to learn from our checkered past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To our surprise, since its publication, None Is Too Many has taken on a life of its own. We thought it would never be more than a disturbing piece of history describing a shameful period of the Canadian past. Instead, it has become an ethical yardstick against which contemporaneous government policies are gauged. We take pride that our book is often cited in debates over refugee and immigration policy and is often credited with helping make these policies more humane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We know, for example, that None Is Too Many was instrumental in opening up Canada's gates to vast numbers of desperate Vietnamese forced out into the rough, pirate-infested waters of the South China Sea in the late 1970s. The Canadian minister of immigration at the time, Ron Atkey, later told us that in the midst of the crisis, while he was being pressured by some to allow the refugees in and by many others to keep them out, he received an advance copy of some chapters of the book. These, he said, emboldened him not to behave in the same callous way a previous government had rebuffed European Jews. His courageous decision opened up Canada's doors to tens of thousands of valuable new citizens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And 30 years later, that is our hope – that never again at any time for anyone, should none be too many.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A parliamentary celebration marking the 30th anniversary of the book is being held this evening in Ottawa.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone may realize this, but their <span class="companylink">Montreal Canadiens</span> careers overlapped for a little more than seven seasons – a period when Saku Koivu was the captain and Sheldon Souray provided a punishing physical presence on the blueline.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a time Koivu when went through his cancer scare, and Souray had all kinds of health problems, too, mostly relating to his endless wrist issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Habs were competitive and twice advanced to the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs. Now, however, as they near the end of their respective NHL careers, Koivu and Souray are unexpectedly sipping from whatever fountain of youth seems to permeate the waters in Southern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't just Teemu Selanne, 42, helping the <span class="companylink">Anaheim Ducks</span> get off to a nobody-saw-this-coming 13-2-1 start (before Monday night's game). It is also Koivu, 38, third on the team in scoring with 15 points in 16 games (ahead of such luminaries as Corey Perry and Bobby Ryan); and Souray, 36, posting a plus-13 rating as part of the team's primary shutdown pair alongside François Beauchemin. Overall, Souray was tied for second in the NHL in plus-minus and Koivu, at plus-11, was tied for sixth, prior to Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, the two old warhorses still have something to give: Koivu as the No. 3 centre in head coach Bruce Boudreau's system; and Souray, still booming that slap shot and playing with a hard, physical edge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“One thing about [Boudreau], he's really smart with communication to the older players,” Koivu said, prior to Monday's much-anticipated Battle of California match-up against the defending Stanley Cup champion <span class="companylink">Los Angeles Kings</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I talked to him before the season, he said: ‘I need you as fresh as I can get. The schedule's going to be tough, so you're going to have some days off. You're not 20 any more. The recovery will take more time than you're used to,'” Koivu said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think we've been able to balance well between the practice and the games – and that's working. But I think right now, our team is balanced well. [Daniel] Winnik's been a big part of my line. He's a bigger body, creates room by just going to the corners and the net,” Koivu said. “When you get a good start, you just feel comfortable. You don't have to push things, or force them. It just comes naturally.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Koivu is in his fourth season with the Ducks, after signing with them as a free agent in 2009. Souray played last year with the <span class="companylink">Dallas Stars</span> and moved to Anaheim on a three-year, $11-million (U.S.) contract, which permits him to be closer to his family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As far back as 2005, Souray says he and Koivu talked about how “if you have a little bit of an injury history, hopefully, we can make it up on the back ends of our careers.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Sak is a guy who's so committed to the game. When we had the lockout this year, some days we'd have six guys at practice, some days we had 12 and some days we'd go to L.A. to combine our skates. But if we only had six guys out, you could count on Saku and Teemu being two of them,” Souray said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Those were two guys who were so dedicated and committed. When the coaches are drawing something up, they're there paying attention. They're not like the rest of us – grabbing a coffee or watching TV. So it's not one of those things where you think, he's getting lucky. He works for every piece of ice. He always has. He's that little ‘Ball of Hate.' Off the ice, he's great. On the ice, don't turn your back on him. Every bit of success he has, you're not surprised at all.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ducks and Kings each won a Stanley Cup in the seven years between lockouts, which makes their rivalry one of the better, if lesser-known, ones. Rivalries tend to ebb and flow and generally only really heat up when both teams are playing well and expectations rise accordingly. L.A. is heating up and the Ducks have been good from the get-go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Souray says he's been part of rivalries that were one-sided and thus not nearly as exciting or relevant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I was in New Jersey, we were really good and the [New York] Rangers were … okay,” he said. “When I was in Montreal, Boston was really good and we were … okay. But when you have two teams that are good and there's a certain amount of expectation on the organization and on the players, there's just more at stake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You feel the losses a little more. The wins become more important. When you're involved in a rivalry, or games that have so much meaning, it becomes more intense.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figuring out John Farrell isn't rocket science. He's just another selfish guy loyal to himself and his career.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this knuckleball stuff? This weirdness of subtracting spin and talking about the “one, last, subtle move” in the final 18 inches to the plate – not 21 or 23 or 14 but 18 inches, mind you, but 18 inches – just might be rocket science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's certainly a great deal of fun. That's why Monday's spring training debut by R.A. Dickey was so eagerly anticipated by his teammates, including those who stayed around to watch even when they weren't playing or pitching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was Grapefruit League action against a non-descript <span class="companylink">Boston Red Sox</span> split squad, but the 34 pitches (24 strikes) that Dickey threw in a <span class="companylink">Toronto Blue Jays</span> uniform were, the defending National League Cy Young Award winner acknowledged, a first baby step in preparation aimed at seeing how his pitch translated into the hurly-burly of the American League East.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was like finding yourself in the middle of a physics experiment, because the <span class="companylink">Red Sox</span> started a minor-league pitcher trying to make a conversion similar to Dickey's, Steven Wright, and brought along former knuckleballer Tim Wakefield to monitor the outing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wright struck out three batters in two innings, and like Dickey seemed to throw a harder knuckleball than the usual floating pitch so many associate it as being. Later, Dickey spoke at length about viewing his transition to the AL East as allowing him an opportunity to show that the pitch can be “trustworthy” in the AL. He has already resolved himself to the possibility that the 230 strikeouts he put up in 2012 won't likely translate to the AL with the designated hitter and generally deeper lineups – “I don't see a plummet,” he said, “but I can see, maybe, 200 strikeouts.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dickey isn't the first guy to throw a knuckleball, but given the fuss created by last season, it sure seems like it. The MLB Network created a show, The Next Knuckler, based on the pitch. And Dickey, who walked one and gave up four hits, shrugged when he was asked if he'd become some kind of pied piper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think it's maybe the success of the pitch,” he said. “Maybe front-office personnel are starting to trust that it can be an effective product for the team. A knuckleballer can gobble up innings, pitch on short rest … you can do a lot of things a conventional pitcher cannot do. Maybe there's some progressive thinking going on that wasn't there before.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were certainly a progressive 4,824 in attendance at Florida Auto Exchange Stadium. Anybody expecting vindictiveness towards Farrell in what would turn into a 4-2 <span class="companylink">Red Sox</span> win was disappointed. The snowbirds let you down, <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span> fans. Farrell was booed when his name was announced along with that of the <span class="companylink">Red Sox</span> lineup, but other than the odd “Farrell, you suck,” the <span class="companylink">Red Sox</span> skipper might be forgiven for thinking everyone else is as deluded as he is, and actually believes like Farrell that he was in fact traded to the <span class="companylink">Red Sox</span>, as opposed to orchestrating his departure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farrell spun that yarn again for reporters on Monday, but soon everybody transitioned from talking about a knucklehead to talking about the knuckleball, and the 12 miles an hour wind blowing at his back probably made Dickey feel all the better about signing a contract extension with a team that pitches in a stadium with a retractable roof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The thing that makes a knuckleball good is late movement, particularly movement around the plate,” he explained. “If the wind is pushing it to the catcher's mitt before it makes that last, little finish, you lose maybe one subtle break that causes a hitter to swing and miss. Days when that happens, you need to change speeds and mix in fastballs more.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Catcher J.P. Arencibia's ability to handle Dickey's knuckleball will be one of the storylines of the spring, especially since it has emerged that there's no guarantee Arencibia actually winds up catching Dickey when the two report to Team USA for the World Baseball Classic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wild pitches and passed balls are part of the deal for catchers working with knuckleballers – it really is an ego-check – and Arencibia also acknowledged that framing pitches for umpires, which can lead to all important stolen strikes, is pretty much a lost cause with a knuckler. The rest of it is, in his words, “trying to wait as long as possible to catch it.” Speaking of which: Did you catch the one about the manager who weaseled his way out of his contract?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He may have predicted the French Revolution, the atomic bomb, the Kennedy assassinations and a thousand other events, but not this: Feb. 25, 2013, and the <span class="companylink">Montreal Canadiens</span> standing first in the same Eastern Conference in which they came dead last a year ago.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time they were in this position on this date was 1993 – their last Stanley Cup and the last one raised in Canada in 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only that, but the Habs are being hard-chased by the rebuilding and injury-devastated <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span> – who beat Montreal 2-1 in a thrilling overtime shootout Monday – and the Stanley-Cup-barren-since-1967 <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Montreal forward Colby Armstrong put it Monday: “It's a weird feeling.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weird for everyone: The Golden Triangle of Montreal-Ottawa-Toronto mattering again in <span class="companylink">NHL</span> hockey, rivalries rising, the three teams perhaps pushing each other to excel even more as the regular season races toward its finish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Admittedly, this is not a normal <span class="companylink">NHL</span> March. Monday at Scotiabank Place, the Senators played only their 20th game, meeting the storied Canadiens in their 19th. From worst to first seems almost incomprehensible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We never knew what was going to happen coming out of the gate,” Armstrong admitted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor did the Senators, struck hard by injuries to their three best players and entering the game on a four-game win streak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To no surprise, the game was perfectly even through two periods, neither side able to score in the first period, swapping goals in the second, and settling matters in the shootout when Peter Regin scored on the ninth shootout shot and Tomas Plekanec could not answer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Habs were, at times, brilliant during regulation, the Flying Frenchmen of yesteryear reincarnated in Russians, Americans, Czechs and, of course, Canadians. Had it not been for the equal brilliance – and goalposts – of Ottawa goaltender Ben Bishop, this game might have been over in the first period. Bishop made 44 saves in total.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, Ottawa was first to score, rookie Dave Dziurzynski blasted a long slapper from the left boards past the outstretched glove of Montreal goaltender Carey Price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was just trying to throw one off the net” for a rebound, Dziurzynski told Sportsnet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadiens tied the game 1-1 with only four seconds left in the second period, when Andrei Markov scored from the point on a power play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was slightly poetic Regin would win it the shootout, as he had cracked a slap shot off Price's crossbar in the dying seconds of overtime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This curious squashed season is now almost halfway done and – for whatever the reasons – Canada rules the Eastern Conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Pittsburgh Penguins</span>, <span class="companylink">Boston Bruins</span> and <span class="companylink">New Jersey Devils</span> can also stake claims, but the simple fact that Canadian teams are in the mix is more than a bit surprising, given the dire preseason predictions of those experts who consider Nostradamus an amateur tea leaf reader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago in the East, only Ottawa was able to slip into the postseason, nailing the eighth and final spot in the dying days of a full season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Western Conference, only the <span class="companylink">Vancouver Canucks</span>, standing first overall, made it to Stanley Cup play – leaving Canada with a piddling two of 16 playoff spots. That could double, or more, this season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadiens, previously considered a team with a goaltender (Price) and an albatross (Scott Gomez) have a new owner, new general manager, new head coach and new purpose to go with a great deal of speed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I've got to credit the coaching staff a lot for getting the most out of everybody,” said Max Pacioretty, who came into Monday's game tied for the team lead in scoring with four goals and nine assists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senators, considered lost when top scorer Jason Spezza, Norris Trophy winner Erik Karlsson and goaltender Craig Anderson went down to injury, had won four in a row as they faced Montreal and held the best home record (8-1-2) in the league.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We changed the water,” Ottawa head coach Paul MacLean joked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senators are convinced they can remain in contention, even though Karlsson and Spezza are likely lost for the season. Anderson, the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> player of the month for January, tested his sprained ankle with a light skate Monday, but is still likely several games away from returning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If we can overcome it in the short term,” captain Daniel Alfredsson said, “why can't we overcome it in the long term?”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Justin Trudeau was a lawyer, one of his advisers was pointing out the other day, he wouldn't be getting nearly as much criticism about his credentials for the Liberal leadership. But oh, he was just a teacher. Not good enough.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is that? the strategist asked. Where does this kind of career condescension come from?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trudeau is being criticized as a tenderfoot who lacks both experience and substance by Conservative Jason Kenney and Liberal foes including Marc Garneau, who is now demanding a head-to-head debate to unmask him. But the son of the storied prime minister won't bite. He's been around too long to fall for that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arguments against Mr. Trudeau's leadership preparedness, which will get more airtime in this weekend's candidates' debate, certainly have some merit. But to give his defenders their due, they also tend to overlook a few things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For starters, Mr. Trudeau has about the same amount of experience as Stephen Harper did when he sought the Alliance Party leadership in 2002. Mr. Harper was roughly the same age and had served about the same number of years in Parliament. Mr. Trudeau was a teacher. Although Mr. Harper likes to call himself an economist, he wasn't. He had a graduate degree in economics but no real job experience in it. He did have some executive experience as head of a small right-wing lobby group, the National Citizens Coalition, and as policy director for the Reform Party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to argue that he was better prepared would be to forget a big advantage Mr. Trudeau has over everyone in the experience department. You want political seasoning? How about being raised since birth in the cauldron of power? How about living all your early life at 24 Sussex Dr., son of a prime minister?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a course in political immersion, it's hard to beat. Years of foreign leaders and premiers and princes and kings traipsing through your living room. Heated debates at your dining room table. Daily life with Papa PM during the fight for the country in the 1980 referendum. Constitutional negotiations with the premiers just down the stairs from your bedroom. Foreign trips to broaden the perspective. Then, all the counsel and tutoring in his father's post-prime-ministerial years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Politics in the blood? Who among young Mr. Trudeau's challengers can match it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His political education might help explain how he has moved through the early months of the leadership without many pratfalls. Under pressure, he's reacted with equanimity, like someone who has been around a while.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may be because of all this experience that he hasn't put forward innovative policy proposals, as Mr. Garneau claims. Mr. Trudeau has seen a lot in his time. Maybe he knows how to play frontrunner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experience has its downsides. All those years in the cocoon of privilege and power raise the question of how far you can see beyond it. You're suspected of not knowing what's on the other side of the tracks. (This was thought of the Kennedys, wrongly.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remember that, in addition to Mr. Harper, Brian Mulroney had zero experience as an elected politician before becoming Tory leader. Barack Obama served some time in the Illinois state Senate, but had just two years of experience in Washington before running for president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's on matters of policy substance that Mr. Trudeau is most vulnerable. He has shown little depth. Supporters can point to the abbreviated leaderships of Michael Ignatieff, Stéphane Dion and Paul Martin. They had heft but didn't last because they lacked something more important – political smarts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what counts in this game, just ask Mr. Harper. That's the big question here – whether all the time at the vortex of power has provided Mr. Trudeau with those smarts.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Stoppard's adaptation of the four Ford Madox Ford novels known as Parade's End (HBO Canada, 9 p.m.) has been promoted, in pre-broadcast reviews, as compensation for those who miss Downton Abbey. The gist is, hey, it is set in Edwardian England, there are a lot of toffs talking, the clothes and furniture are gorgeous, so there you go – a stand-in for Downton.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is balderdash. Parade's End is Downton on acid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is much to say about it, actually, but one notable point is that Stoppard, distinguished playwright and screenplay maestro (Anna Karenina, Shakespeare in Love) lost the plot. Can't hardly blame him. The four novels go hither and thither in time and tone, as does this five-part, HBO/BBC series. At times it is deeply serious, a grave meditation on honour, and then there are scenes of camp comedy that leave you gobsmacked and giggling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is also important to note that it has the most compelling female character on TV in ages. She's scintillating and a very, very bad woman. By “bad” I mean that in the context of the story, she's toxic – married to a nice man but keeps running away with other chaps and then saying the most haughtily sarcastic things. This is a woman who will shiver your timbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She's Sylvia (Rebecca Hall), who is married to the main man in the story, Christopher Tietjens (Benedict Cumberbatch), a rich Tory, a genius government statistician and a drip. When things open, Tietjens is about to marry Sylvia, against the advice of his pals. It turns out that, upon marriage, Sylvia is already knocked up, and Tietjens isn't sure if he's the father. He has had coitus with her. This is established by a flashback to their first meeting, on a train. Before you can say, “Ride a cock-horse to Charing Cross/ To see a young lady jump on a white horse/ with rings on her fingers and bells on her toes,” Sylvia is straddling Tietjens. Thing is, she has been with other chaps, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time passes. The child is born and Sylvia, clothed in stunning dresses, has decamped to France with a fellow named Potty. Not a word of a lie. His name's “Potty.” There is a remarkable scene – one that establishes Sylvia, and Rebecca Hall, as utterly unforgettable – in which she tells Potty she's tired of him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Oh, Potty,” she says, “I do hope you're not going to behave badly. I miss my husband. He's a block of wood, but it's like being with a grown-up man, rather than trying to entertain a schoolboy.” Potty then brandishes a pistol. Barely paying attention, Sylvia drawls, “I say, you're not going to kill yourself, are you, Potty?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Tietjens has established himself as the most boring man in England. He meets a young suffragette, Valentine Wannop (Adelaide Clemens, who is coiffed in a most modern hairdo for an Edwardian period piece), and they make goo-goo eyes at each other for years. Tietjens goes off to war, suffers, and returns to make many speeches about being a gentleman. (On these occasions Cumberbatch speaks as if his mouth is full of marbles.) Others, however, see him as a fool, and conspire not to cash his cheques, and bar him from his gentlemen's club. Oh, the high drama! At occasional times, Rufus Sewell appears as a demented priest making remarks about self-abuse and ladies' undergarments. Mad, I tell you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parade's End is a delight when Sylvia is front and centre. Cracking woman. You can't take your eyes off her. But the entire series is best watched while sozzled. If it's not Downton on acid, then it's a very drunk Downton.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter says Canada contributed 90 per cent to the escape of six Americans hidden in the homes of Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor and diplomat John Sheardown, during the 1979 hostage crisis in Iran. The <span class="companylink">U.S. Central Intelligence Agency</span> contributed the other 10 per cent. Mr. Carter was in a position to know, and there is no reason to believe he is being falsely modest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those 90-10 proportions were, roughly, reversed in the Ben Affleck-directed movie, Argo, which won the Oscar for Best Picture on Sunday night. The movie stole Canada's glory.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A little consternation is deserved – perhaps even obligatory – but it's worthwhile asking why we don't do a better job at creating our own myths through film. A relatively small audience, poor economics, competition with the behemoth next door – all true, but all excuses, somehow, for a lack of vision and power. Quebec filmmakers have been producing strong films – including Rebelle, an Oscar nominee for best foreign-language film, the third year in a row for a Quebec film – and are showing that it can be done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the storyteller goes the right to tell the story in his or her own way. Ben Affleck, also the movie's star, is right to say that “based on a true story” does not mean the story is true. Artists should and do have licence to tell their own truths. They do not need to let the facts stand in the way of a good story. (Canada had its own kick at this one – a 1981 TV movie starring Gordon Pinsent as Ken Taylor. It was the Americans' turn.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Argo's ending, for instance, involving a near-catastrophe and a chase scene, is pure fiction. To ask whether it was a good ending is not to ask whether it was true. The question is whether it served the story, and the audience. It did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. myth-making machine that is Hollywood has no counterpart in Canada. There can't be many people who watch U.S. movies expecting them to be “true” in the sense a documentary is true. Anyone who watches U.S. movies should realize that there is often something very false in the depictions of people, society and history and, paradoxically, a reflection of something very true to the U.S. mythos – the beliefs, values and attitudes that make up that society. Argo in that way is typical Hollywood.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not long ago, I spent a few hours with a friend at a hospital emergency room. It was crammed. Here's what I saw: loads and loads of fat people. Fat young mothers with babies who will probably grow up to be as fat as they are. Fat teenaged boys guzzling pop and pizza slices. Fat fathers munching on chips. The young people were fatter than the old ones. Most were first- or second-generation Canadians who had clearly embraced their adoptive country's eating habits with a vengeance.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is futile to believe we can somehow hound the populace into diets, exercise and healthier food choices. It will never work. Big Food is bigger than all of us. And Big Food has spent billions of dollars developing products that we can't resist – products that created the fattest generation ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Author Michael Moss (who was interviewed in Monday's Globe and Mail) spent years finding out how Big Food works its evil magic. His new book, Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us, will make even the most ardent libertarian think hard. I've always believed that governments have no business telling us what to eat and not eat. But now I'm thinking I might have been wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble is that Big Food knows exactly what we crave. And what we crave is terrible for us. Take potato chips – the biggest weight-gain villain of them all. “The coating of salt, the fat content that rewards the brain with instant feelings of pleasure, the sugar that exists not as an additive but in the starch of the potato itself – all of this combines to make it the perfect addictive food,” he says in a book excerpt published by The New York Times on Sunday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I was growing up, potato chips were a sometime snack. Today, people eat them all the time, with everything. Sophisticated engineering and relentless marketing turned potato chips into a $15-billion industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our puny willpower is no match for the mighty forces that Big Food can deploy to find your sweet/salty/fat spot. It's no good to say we should just ban potato chips, because everything is junk food. Big Food has even corrupted healthy food like yogurt by adding tons of sugar. These highly processed foods are more convenient and often cheaper than what you can make yourself – if, that is, you still know how to cook. To many people, the processed versions are also tastier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moss's book opens with an extraordinary meeting of Big Food CEOs back in 1999. The subject for their meeting was the growing obesity epidemic and what their companies might be prepared to do about it. The worry was that Big Food could become the next Big Tobacco – a ripe target for stiff taxes and regulation. But no one was prepared to act. They weren't in the business of nutrition. They were in the business of selling stuff that tastes good, forget about Type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more we learn about behaviour, the more we find out how hard it is to self-regulate. People often fail to act in their own best interests. They don't eat healthily, they don't save for retirement. Sometimes, they can be nudged into good behaviour. And sometimes, there's a case for coercive paternalism – especially when society has to pick up the pieces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's the thing: Who does the coercing? If it's me and my friends, I'm all for it. If it's you and your friends, you can go to hell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If only we could start a grassroots uprising against junk food. Let's seize the chip bags from people's hands and smash the soft-drink machines the way Carrie Nation broke up the saloons. Let's shame Big Food into taking out the bad stuff and replacing it with good stuff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble is, Mr. Moss reports, they tried that. It tasted awful.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does Mayor Rob Ford have some kind of bulletproof armour underneath his business suit? Lately, it almost seems so. He hasn't only been dodging bullets; he's been walking in front of them. They seem to bounce right off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the third time in two months that Mr. Ford has survived a serious legal challenge. At the end of December, a judge dismissed a libel case against him from the owner of a waterfront pub. At the end of January, an appeal court overturned a judge's ruling ousting him from office for violating conflict-of-interest rules. Now this. Despite evidence of several apparent campaign-spending violations during Mr. Ford's 2010 run for mayor, the city's audit committee voted 2-1 on Monday not to appoint a prosecutor to pursue the case.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No wonder the mayor was so triumphant when he faced reporters after the decision. “It's a great day for democracy,” he said, again listing his accomplishments as mayor. If he doesn't trip up again, he has a chance of recovering from his series of much-publicized troubles and even winning re-election in October 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with this mayor, that is always a big “if.” Regrettably, there is little to indicate that Mr. Ford has learned anything from this series of embarrassing and eminently avoidable troubles. After the audit decision, his brother, Doug, again accused the mayor's left-wing critics of waging a campaign to overturn the result of the 2010 election by other means. When a reporter asked if the mayor had not sometimes courted trouble by ignoring the rules, the answer was a straight No.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mayor himself saw only vindication in the audit committee's split vote. “I'm happy the committee understands we ran a clean, professional and above-board campaign. We made every effort to comply with all the rules.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is that what the committee said when it decided not to commence proceedings? It released no ruling and its members made no statement, so it is hard to say. They may simply have decided that, as Mr. Ford's lawyer argued, there was no percentage in proceeding given the difficulty of a successful prosecution. In the end, they voted to accept the findings of an auditor who found apparent violations of the spending rules – but not to take further action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stripped of all the legal jargon, the argument the mayor's lawyers made against prosecuting him boiled down to this: Why bother? The things he is accused of doing are piddling and minor. They didn't affect the outcome of the election that made him mayor – he would have won anyway – and none of it was deliberate or sneaky. It was a big, expensive, complex campaign and, well, stuff happens. If you send this to a prosecutor, it will just cost the taxpayer a lot of money and end with no more than a slap on the wrist. So get a life, drop it and move on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The question is not whether or not … there was a contravention of the legislation. The question is whether anything more is to be gained by prosecution in the public interest,” Ford lawyer Tom Barlow argued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a fair point. Part of the audit committee's job is to decide whether prosecution would have a reasonable chance of success. But it left some troubling questions dangling. The auditor retained to report on the Ford campaign found a whole raft of apparent violations, from spending money before the campaign launch and borrowing money from the Ford family business instead of a bank to taking banned contributions from corporations and exceeding the campaign spending limit. Now those issues will never be tested in court or even scrutinized by a prosecutor. It makes you wonder why the spending rules are there in the first place. Is it now okay to spend money before the campaign launch or to take money from companies, as long as it isn't too much money?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the lawyer for the complainants, Heidi Rubin, put it, “The election financing rules lose their muscle unless candidates remain accountable for their apparent contraventions. … The purpose of the rules is to retain the confidence of the electorate in the integrity of the process, to uphold the values of transparency and of accountability. “</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appointing a prosecutor might have cleared the air. Instead, we have this unsatisfying finish. If the mayor has learned anything from this latest close shave, he has yet to show it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've always spent my own sweet time getting to know cheese. So I was a tad apprehensive about taking a speed-dating approach to fromage. A few weeks ago, however, I tasted 225 cheeses in the span of 48 hours.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the eighth edition of the biennial competition, established in 1998 by the <span class="companylink">Dairy Farmers of Canada</span>, which is open to any producer of cheese made from 100-per-cent-Canadian cow's milk.</p>

We had evaluated all 225 entries without a clue as to which province they came from or who the producer was (though there was a pretty strong Quebec vibe from the washed-rind category). You might exchange glances with another judge from your province with a silent “Hey, is that what I think it is?” but overall it was hard to know what cheese we were judging. Which of course, was the whole point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone who has ever done a side-by-side tasting (be it wine, cheese or peanut M&amp;Ms) will know that preferences vary from person to person. We used a detailed scoring system to keep our assessments as objective as possible. Each cheese was evaluated on flavour, texture, appearance (are there production flaws such as cracks or other irregularities?) and salt balance. Cheeses are separated into styles, such as fresh cheese (ricotta or mascarpone, for example), cheddar (with five categories based on age) or washed-rind (my favourite to taste; I was impressed by how many great ones we're making in this country).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I highly recommend doing a mini Grand Prix at home. Try three cheeses side by side that are of the same style but different producers – or even different milks or ages. No other accompaniments allowed. You may find that your favourite feta isn't actually your favourite. By allowing yourself to compare and think about what you taste, you'll get a clear sense of how a food made with so few ingredients can vary so vastly in flavour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what happens if you're judging and you do recognize a cheese you like … or even love? Well, you try to taste it as if it were the first time. I did recognize a cheese I enjoy frequently, but it was not in its best condition. Because it didn't reflect the qualities that should be showcased in that particular style, I regretfully had to acknowledge that in its score. Staying objective meant evaluating based on what you were tasting that day – not reminiscing about how good something had been before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I will admit that is stings just a little to see the three finalists in each category and realize your top pick did not make it. Having a diverse jury levels the playing field, but one must also get over a certain indignation that not everyone agreed with you. As for the Grand Champion, it came as a surprise when I saw the cheese that scored highest among all the Category Champions. But it's tribute to the winner that even at that point, with a couple hundred cheeses under our belts, I wasn't the only judge who couldn't resist a few extra bites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until April 18, however, when the winners are officially announced, my lips are sealed. Well, except to eat cheese of course.</p>
