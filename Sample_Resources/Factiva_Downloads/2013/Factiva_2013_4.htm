<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many people, a plate of piping hot pasta spells comfort on a cold winter day. And if you're short on time – and energy – that store-bought jar of marinara sauce can be convenient. And good for you, too. Most tomato-based sauces are low in saturated fat, cholesterol-free and packed with lycopene, an antioxidant that's been linked to protection from prostate cancer.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not all pasta sauces are created equal. The main ingredients in most commercial marinara sauces are tomato puree (i.e. water and tomato paste), tomatoes, vegetable oil, salt (sometimes lots of it), sugar and spices. Extras like cheese, meat and cream add calories, sodium and saturated fat, the type that can raise blood cholesterol. You need to read nutrition labels to know what you're buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When buying a commercial tomato sauce, choose one with no more than 1 gram of saturated fat and no more than 350 milligrams of sodium per half cup serving. To prevent your sodium intake from climbing, bulk up your serving sauce with extra vegetables.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leslie Beck, a registered dietitian, is the national director of nutrition at BodyScience Medical. She can be seen every Thursday at noon on CTV News Channel's Direct (www.lesliebeck.com[http://www.lesliebeck.com]).</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chunky Ragu Tomato, Garlic &amp; Onion</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sauce to pass on is Chunky Ragu Tomato, Garlic and Onion. Its name sounds pretty healthy. Even the label boasts 2.5 servings of vegetables per half cup serving. But don't count on this pasta sauce to supply a few of your veggie servings for the day. One serving delivers only 1 gram of fibre and less than 10 per cent of the daily value for vitamins A and C. (A daily value of 15 per cent or greater is considered a good source of these antioxidant nutrients, found in vegetables and fruit.) Worse is the sodium count at 500 milligrams per half cup, one-third of a day's worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nutritional value of a ½ cup serving: 90 calories• 2.5 grams fat</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EAT THIS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Catelli Garden Select Six Vegetable Recipe Garlic &amp; Onion</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A better pick is Catelli's Garden Select Six Vegetable Recipe Garlic &amp; Onion. In addition to tomato puree and tomatoes, it's made with carrots, celery, green peppers and onion, adding four times more fibre and more vitamins A and C to each serving. Not bad for a sauce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One-half cup also delivers 30 per cent less sodium (350 milligrams per serving ). It's lighter on refined sugar too, with sugar ranking fifth on the ingredient list rather than third as on Ragu's. (Much of the sugar in tomato sauce is naturally occurring sugar from tomatoes.)</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Kathleen Wynne's victory had come solely on the strength of having Gerard Kennedy and Eric Hoskins standing behind her, there would be serious cause for concern that the Ontario Liberals are in the process of abandoning the political centre for a run at the left. But Ms. Wynne is premier-designate of Ontario because she was able to rally support from all sides of the Liberal party on Saturday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trailing Sandra Pupatello on the first two ballots, Ms. Wynne was able to capture the prize on the third and final vote because she attracted the support of Charles Sousa, whose own campaign to be the “jobs premier” suggested a move to Ms. Pupatello would have been much more logical.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kennedy said that Ms. Wynne's desire to help the vulnerable and restore labour peace with the province's teachers resonated with him. But Mr. Sousa's decision provides some hope that the Liberals will indeed be fiscally prudent, and perhaps even that Mr. Sousa might be appointed finance minister. Ms. Wynne has already suggested she will not undo the labour contracts that have infuriated public-sector workers, and indeed flirting with such a retreat would be fiscally explosive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dalton McGuinty, the outgoing Premier, after years of increased spending in education, health care and other public services, wisely last year sought to put a halt to it. Faced with serious fiscal challenges, Mr. McGuinty got tough with the unions. “Zero means zero” was the mantra. After years of generous settlements, it wasn't too much to ask, but labour was rallying en masse outside the leadership convention on Saturday and Ms. Wynne will be tempted, no doubt, to loosen the purse strings, if not this time then next. Ontario will be looking for some restraint from Ms. Wynne on that front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One welcome signal is her decision to quickly recall Ontario's legislature. The prorogation was a disgrace, and Ms. Wynne was among the first to raise an eyebrow when Mr. McGuinty suspended active democracy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wynne's Liberals would be wise to produce an economic statement, or perhaps a new budget, sooner rather than later. There are plenty of other issues that she will want to take on, but they all pale next to the need to restrain and reduce spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the province's 2012-13 deficit projection was adjusted to $11.98 billion, down from $14.4 billion last fall. The improvement was due to higher than expected corporate tax revenues and one-time savings from the elimination of banked sick days for teachers. The rating agencies are no doubt watching Ontario with interest. Wrong signals from Ms. Wynne – or worse, no clear signals at all – would threaten to provoke a selloff of provincial debt, further downgrades and higher interest payments. Were that to happen, the new premier would have to say goodbye to enhanced teacher benefits, social spending, and any other sugarplums that may be dancing in her head.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For someone who campaigned as a “social justice” candidate, it will not be easy to say no. There will be demands for new social spending. Cities will also want more, starting with Toronto and its troubled transit system. Financially strapped colleges and universities will also want more, and on it goes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We all must wish Premier Kathleen Wynne well. The entire country needs Ontario to get its fiscal house in order. If the Liberals she now leads are not up to that challenge, there is another party in Ontario that is ready to demonstrate it is.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a good thing militant Islamists have a knack for spin. When al-Qaeda-linked insurgents declared that France had “opened the gates of hell” with its assault in Mali, it offered up a headline opportunity to news media around the world.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any attention paid to this part of Africa brings a whimper of hope for those living where the gates of hell have been swinging wide open for some time: the borderland in Sudan. It's 3,000 kilometres from Mali, where international troops are currently focused – a man-made famine zone where Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir has been orchestrating a humanitarian catastrophe that has affected more than 800,000 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, Canadian writers Gerald Caplan and Amanda Grzyb wrote in The Globe and Mail about the efforts of 66 genocide scholars (including themselves) from 10 countries to demand help for the people suffering in the state of Blue Nile and the Nuba Mountains region of South Kordofan, which border newly independent South Sudan. “We can clearly see the tragic cost of the world's collective inaction,” they wrote, detailing the famine and state-sponsored violence against civilians there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Efforts to enact the Responsibility to Protect, <span class="companylink">the United Nations</span> doctrine that says humanity has a duty to defend innocent civilians, is mired in the mysteries of why governments choose the locations they do and why our appetite for such stories is eclipsed by entertainment and ease. Where is a caring God when you need one? I suppose the answer is readily available in something quite germane to our Canadian psyche.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since June, 2011, Mr. al-Bashir has effectively banned all international humanitarian access to these areas. Many Canadian charities are doing their work off the record in order to safeguard their access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The charity workers we do know about are the kind of Canadians we admire. For example, there is 29-year-old Anne Amirthanayagam of Toronto. She was doing customer data research when she felt a nagging need for something different. By Skype, I caught up with her this week at the Yida refugee camp on the South Sudanese side of the border, where she works as a logistics co-ordinator for <span class="companylink">Samaritan's Purse</span> Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Many children have passed away because of malnutrition,” she told me, noting the 1,200 new registrants in her camp of 65,000, which is about 20 kilometres from the war zone. “There was a lot of aerial bombardment in December. People come as they can get out. Most have very young children and are pretty malnourished.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian donors to <span class="companylink">Samaritan's Purse</span> are paying for the camp's water and sanitation needs. Ms. Amirthanayagam also manages World Food Program logistics for the delivery of food, which is limited to sorgum, oil, salt and lentils. “It's pretty basic – vegetables are rare,” she said. There are still no schools, but refugees have created mosques and churches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was Christ's call that drew Ms. Amirthanayagam to Yida, she said, but she's discovering something indomitable in the people there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Nubian people are a pretty amazing group. They are hard workers, they have a strong entrepreneurial spirit about them, and I see a lot of joy in them. If this was North America, I don't think we'd be reacting to the challenges like they have.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, that the people of this camp and the thousands trapped in Sudan could one day soon say the same about us and how we responded to the news of their plight.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Move over, fellas. There's a bunch of new girls in town, and they're in charge. If things keep going this way, the highly exclusive club for Canadian premiers will have to start considering affirmative action for men.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody would dream of calling Kathleen Wynne, Alison Redford, Pauline Marois, Christy Clark, Kathy Dunderdale and Eva Aariak anybody's babies. These six provincial and territorial leaders represent a huge majority of the Canadian population. (A big caution: Both Ms. Clark and Ms. Wynne have yet to be tested by the voters. Ms. Clark looks doomed and Ms. Wynne may not last long either, but you shouldn't count her out.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it an accident or a trend? Probably both. But the bench is deep. Two tough, smart women dominated Ontario's Liberal leadership race. (The other was Sandra Pupatello.) The men in the race ate their dust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's time to celebrate,” says Barbara McDougall, who was a cabinet minister in the Mulroney government (a distinction she shared with Kim Campbell and Pat Carney). She thinks that, on the whole, the calibre of provincial leadership is trending up. Let's hope she's right, because this generation will have the monumental task of satisfying people's expectations for services while wrestling budgets under control. They'll have to act compassionate but stern, and will somehow have to persuade the public – along with teachers, nurses and civil servants – that pain is good for them. “It will be interesting to see if party differences matter as much as before,” Ms. McDougall says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do women do politics differently? That depends. If you're the only woman in the room (Margaret Thatcher, Sheila Copps), you've got to out-macho the men if you want to get ahead. Adding more women to a group tends to cut down on the towel-snapping and elevate the tone. Neither Ms. Redford nor Ms. Wynne is interested in old-style combat politics. They say they want to build bridges, not burn them. Both will have the public cheering loudly if they succeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Women really are less adversarial and combative,” says Barbara Moses, a career-management expert and a contributing columnist for The Globe and Mail. She points out several other factors that make the political experience different for women and for men. Men, in general, are highly competitive and are driven into politics by ego and power needs. Women – even highly competitive ones – are extremely ambivalent about those things. The first half of women's lives tends to be about people-pleasing – parents, bosses, partners, kids. It's only in the second half that women get less interested in pleasing others and more interested in self-expression and making a broader contribution to society. That's why Bill Clinton was governor at 32 and Hillary didn't hit her stride until her 60s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other factors discourage women from entering politics. Women tend to be more thin-skinned than men, Dr. Moses told me – and people in public life today need the hide of a rhinoceros. Women are more reluctant to thrust themselves into the public eye and they take it harder when people don't like them. Obviously women can be as tough as men – or tougher. But first they have to get comfortable with not always being liked or nice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personally, I think women's time in politics has come. There are, for starters, a flood of brilliant and accomplished women who've reached the second half of their lives. Gender is no longer an issue with voters, either. In fact, research shows that voters have high trust in women to manage the issues that most affect their lives – health, education and the like. Voters are sick of combat and hungry for consensus and collaboration. And now, with so many role models in high office, more girls will grow up believing that being premier one day is just a natural thing to do.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So farewell then, Krista Erickson, purveyor of acid interviews and performer of baroque arm-ballet on Sun News Network. May the sun be always at your back, wherever you land in the TV racket.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And farewell, then, Sarah Palin, purveyor of pointless, predictable punditry on Fox News. Once “the hottest cultural figure in America” (according to CNN's Howard Kurtz on the weekend), you are now as cold as the small-town Alaska from which you emerged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's an interesting coincidence, don't you think, this almost-simultaneous departure of two polarizing, right-wing female figures from the scene? One has to wonder why. Is it the right wing that is fading, or is it the fading of right-wing women on TV?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Erickson's case it's fair to speculate that she departed just before the stench of desperation arose from the little Sun News channel. As it battles for mandatory carriage on Canadian cable TV, the channel has become one long, ongoing infomercial, pitching for support for a position it openly despised a few years ago – access to your money whether you watch the channel or not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sun has played the dubious patriotism card, trumpeting its “96 hours per week of pure Canadian content,” which seems odd when you know that the channel's general attitude is this: “Canada sucks.” It also played the equally dubious anti-abortion card, calling on anti-abortion activists to support its petition to the CRTC. Desperation defined, right there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, as constant readers will know, I've nothing against Sun News. It's a very funny channel. But I don't think it should be mandatory, nor should CBC News Network or the CTV News Channel. Pick-and-pay is the only way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that Erickson is gone, Sun's star attractions are those twin rays of sunshine, Ezra Levant and Michael Coren. Magnets for lady viewers they are not, I would venture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the matter of Palin, Fox News, like the entire right-wing Republican-supporting media in the United States, is recalibrating. It was suggested, after Mitt Romney lost the presidential election, that Fox News had done more harm than good to the Republican cause. The wind changes direction, and Palin's moment was long over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The thing is, there is now a shortage of right-women pundits on TV. While it's possible, sometimes, to find Ann Coulter ranting away somewhere on TV, the right-of-centre space is mainly occupied by grumpy old guys going off all pompous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A great deal of television is aimed at women. The number of women rising to political power in Canada – women run half the provinces – and the U.S. increases all the time. Roadblocks to women in politics have disappeared, but this reality is not reflected in the way politics and social issues are covered on TV. Especially on the right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps it is television's fault. It is now well established that there is a serious shortage of women working in commercial TV. A vast number of TV shows don't have, and have never had, a woman writer, director or producer on staff. A couple of years ago, there was media excitement about a wave of new TV shows run by women. At the end of it all, the vast TV industry has only Shonda Rhimes (Scandal, Grey's Anatomy), Lena Dunham (Girls), Liz Meriwether (New Girl), Mindy Kaling (The Mindy Project) and Tina Fey (30 Rock, ending this week).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's plausible to speculate that the industry's wariness of women in creative and executive positions also applies to news punditry. Perhaps the men who run the news-discussion programs and the all-news channels don't feel that women have the gravitas for TV punditry. On the other hand, perhaps there just aren't enough right-wing women pundits any more. Maybe Krista Erickson could shed some light on the issue. But she's gone, gone, gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airing tonight</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American Experience: Henry Ford (PBS, 9 p.m.) is a two-hour examination of Ford's life, work and legacy. It attempts to unravel the complications and contradictions of Ford but acts more as a reminder of puzzles than an answer to the riddles it poses. It suggests that Ford “ushered in the modern world as we know it.” It points out that while he spurred an era of industrialization, he pined for a simpler, more pastoral world. It says that while he was enormously wealthy, he despised the wealthy class. Really, the program is a very useful lesson in how myth can replace fact in the case of an idolized figure.</p>

They were talking up that four of the six Canadians who started the <span class="companylink">Farmers Insurance</span> Open in La Jolla, Calif., were doing well, and that some were even in contention in the tournament that Tiger Woods eventually won for the seventh time when the fourth round concluded Monday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, Woods won his 75th <span class="companylink">PGA</span> Tour event by four shots while the number of Canadian flags near the top subsided. But Ottawa's Brad Fritsch and Weyburn, Sask.'s Graham DeLaet still posted top-10 finishes. Each finished ninth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Mike Weir made his first cut in 19 tournaments. The 42-year-old from Bright's Grove, Ont., has suffered mightily in the last couple of years while trying to fight his way out of a deep slump that might have sent a less determined player packing from the <span class="companylink">PGA</span> Tour. But, finally, Weir made it to the weekend. He was actually tied for second place after shooting 66 in the opening round on the North Course at Torrey Pines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weir played the last three rounds on the much more difficult South course. He shot 75-73-76 to shoot two-over par 290, and fell to a tie for 68th place. Still, the fact that he made a cut was a positive sign. Weir has posted four rounds in the 60s of the nine he's played this season. He's progressing rather than regressing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Hearn, Stephen Ames, and Adam Hadwin were the other three Canadians in the <span class="companylink">Farmers Insurance</span> Open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brantford, Ont.'s Hearn missed the cut, as did Ames, who lives in Calgary. Hadwin doesn't have his <span class="companylink">PGA</span> Tour card this year but the 25-year-old from Abbotsford, B.C., got into the <span class="companylink">Farmers Insurance</span> when he shot 64 to tie for the lead in Monday qualifying at the El Camino Country Club in Oceanside, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hadwin nailed one of the four spots available in the Monday qualifier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hadwin shot 66 on Torrey Pine's North course in the first round.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He followed with 74 and then had to take Saturday off when fog that hung over the course all day kept play from proceeding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He shot 69 on the South course in the third round Sunday and at seven-under par for 54 holes was in great shape heading into the fourth round. Players started the final round Sunday but darkness intervened and play was suspended, to finally conclude on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Hadwin, however, a different sort of darkness settled in on him Sunday, when he started the last round in ninth place. He made seven bogeys, a double bogey, and a triple bogey in his first 15 holes of the final round and was 12-over for the last round when play was stopped. He had fallen to 83rd place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hadwin then withdrew from the tournament. CBS had asked the <span class="companylink">PGA</span> Tour to start the final round Monday at 11:10 a.m. local time so that it could get a 2:30 p.m. finish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">PGA</span> Tour agreed, no doubt because Woods was leading and he's the golfer everybody wants to watch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They're our TV partner and if that's what they want us to do, that's what we're going to do,” said Mark Russell, the <span class="companylink">PGA</span> Tour's senior vice-president of rules and competitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russell couldn't recall a final round starting so late on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The timing meant that Hadwin wouldn't be able to make his qualifying round Monday afternoon for this week's <span class="companylink">Waste Management</span> Phoenix Open in Scottsdale, Ariz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">PGA</span> Tour media official Joe Chemycz said from Torrey Pines that Hadwin didn't provide an official reason for withdrawing, but that he had mentioned that he wanted to make it to the Monday qualifier. Hadwin had the last time but shot 79 and did not qualify for the Phoenix Open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Fritsch, a <span class="companylink">PGA</span> Tour rookie, has now played three tournaments this year and made the cut in each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He started the last round four shots behind Woods, but but fell back in the final round.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He did birdie the final hole Monday to move into the top 10 along with DeLaet, who closed with a 71. Each finished at 281, seven shots behind Woods. Fritsch's high finish enabled him to qualify for Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Monday evening, and the end of the tournament at Torrey Pines, one thing was clear: Woods continued to dominate Torrey Pines, where he also won the 2008 U.S. Open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for Canadians, some light had appeared in the fog that was a big part of the story for much of the <span class="companylink">Farmers Insurance</span> Open.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terrence Ross stretched out in his folding chair. Around him, his <span class="companylink">Toronto Raptors</span> teammates kept up a steady, pregame patter.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who was going to the all-star game? Who was snubbed? What do the <span class="companylink">Boston Celtics</span> do without injured guard Rajon Rondo?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ross had his say, but kept alternating between the replay of the <span class="companylink">Golden State Warriors</span>' 109-102 loss to the <span class="companylink">Milwaukee Bucks</span> last Saturday and fiddling with his iPhone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Who's that?” he asked quickly as a long Warriors three-pointer slipped through the netting? “Curry,” he answered, lending his voice to the chorus in response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are better teams in the NBA than the Warriors, but there may be none trendier with their slightly old-school unis. And, in this city, their splendid point guard, Stephen Curry, is a bit of a big deal thanks in part to the respect his father, Dell, earned as a member of the Raptors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curry was unavailable down the stretch Monday night, nursing an aggravated ankle injury in the locker room, as his teammates pulled away in the fourth quarter for a 114-102 win.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seven-foot centre Andrew Bogut made his first appearance after missing 38 games recovering from ankle surgery, and that helped explain why the Warriors enjoyed a 28-point advantage in the paint. The Raptors finished short-handed, with Landry Fields unavailable for three-quarters of the game due to flu-like symptoms, Kyle Lowry missing with back tightness and Amir Johnson shut down late after hitting his head on the floor after a collision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was the first meeting between Ross and Harrison Barnes, who was selected one spot ahead of him in the 2012 NBA draft. Ross had 11 points off the bench in 22 minutes 30 seconds, while Barnes had 14 points in 32:55, including two points on a weak-side cut worked to perfection with David Lee that gave the Warriors a 94-85 lead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barnes provided the exclamation point late with a hoop-and-harm over, above and around Raptors centre Aaron Gray.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ross was selected by the Raptors with the eighth choice, after Barnes went to the Warriors with the seventh pick – the result of Golden State winning a coin toss between the two 23-43 clubs. Barnes was averaging 8.8 points and 25 minutes heading into Monday's game, while Ross has been something of a revelation for the Raptors, leading the team in scoring twice (including a 102-79 win over the <span class="companylink">Portland Trail Blazers</span> on Jan. 2, when he hit a career-high 26 points) and leading the Toronto bench in scoring nine times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Ross, getting attuned to the rigours of the NBA schedule – and the defensive demands that come with it – has taken some getting used to. But Barnes has picked his spots, earning kudos from head coach of the year candidate Mark Jackson for his work on Kevin Durant in a 104-99 win over the <span class="companylink">Oklahoma City Thunder</span> on Jan. 23, when he helped pressure Durant into four fourth-quarter turnovers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were brave words on the part of the Raptors after they selected Ross last June, but head coach Dwane Casey could not have been clearer. There was no talk about how the Raptors had Ross ranked higher on their board and how they couldn't believe he was still around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It happens,” Casey said on draft night, acknowledging Barnes was the Raptors desire. “You have to take what's given you. He is such a talented player that we knew the possibility was there. So, you go to Plan B.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ross joined the Raptors with the reputation of being a shooter, but he has blossomed as an athletic player with a nose for the glass. After a relatively quiet night Monday, it was Ross's hang-time, bank-shot that tied the score at 75-75, part of a 10-0 run in the third quarter. He is a splendidly gifted offensive player who has also won over Casey with his willingness on defence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He might be the best guy on our team chasing guys down,” the Toronto coach said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ross has picked the brain of teammates such as Alan Anderson, who have worked with him on some of the subtler aspects of the play-for-pay game such as hand-checking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All refs are different,” Ross said. “It's just a little something you need to learn to do to keep guys in front of you.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a balance, to be sure, and Ross acknowledges his teammates have been on him to be less deferential on offence, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plan B? So far, Terrence Ross has been A-okay for the <span class="companylink">Toronto Raptors</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock market made you do it, right?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ignore your registered retirement savings plan, that is. Several days back, I asked members of my <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> personal finance community (subscribe here: facebook.com/robcarrickfinance) what their biggest challenges were to making contributions to RRSPs and tax-free savings accounts. Several people commented that poor investing results had persuaded them to ignore their RRSPs and put their money into mortgage repayment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disappointing returns are a sign you need to rethink your investments, not that you should ignore saving and investing for retirement. But that said, there are times when it makes sense to pay down debt at the expense of retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RRSPs versus debt repayment is one of the longest-running debates in personal finance, and the reason is that few experts are willing to take a firm stand on what the right approach is. Too often, you hear that the right approach is to make an RRSP contribution and then use the tax savings to pay down your mortgage. But aren't there situations where one approach is simply better than the other?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to some work by Talbot Stevens, a financial speaker, author and industry consultant, we now have a real-life guide for deciding on retirement saving versus debt repayment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stevens has listed four factors to consider, the first being your savings discipline. Ask yourself: If you pay your debts down, what will you do with the cash flow you free up?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine you spend $20,000 a year on mortgage payments. Once your debt is cleared, you need to add that money to your savings/investing routine, not spend it. “Only the most disciplined, who will truly invest every penny of their mortgage payments after they're debt free, will be better off paying down their mortgage first,” Mr. Stevens writes in an outline of his views on RRSPs versus debt paydown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next, consider the emotional angle. Do you find yourself worrying a lot about your debts or lack of a solid retirement fund? If so, Mr. Stevens' suggestion is to “do what is emotionally best for you first. Then you'll be better able to do what is financially best later on.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third factor is math-based. If the interest rate on your debt is three percentage points higher than the average annual return you expect from your retirement investments, then ignore the RRSP and pay off debt. To further simplify, paying off a big unpaid credit card balance accruing interest at a rate of 29 per cent or thereabouts is your top priority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After that, you have to consider a few variables, such as the expected rate of return on your retirement investments. For a balanced portfolio, 5 per cent after fees sounds reasonable. This sets a fairly high hurdle for debt to take precedence over retirement savings. In today's low interest rate world, credit lines and loans don't often cost 8 per cent or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The qualification on this rule is that it applies to people who invest two-thirds of the cash flow they free up by paying off debt. The ideal is 100 per cent reinvestment of your former debt payments, but Mr. Stevens is mindful of human frailty. “I'm trying to pick a middle-of-the-road behaviour,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The threshold for choosing debts over RRSPs isn't quite so high for a disciplined saver who plans to put 100 per cent of his or her former loan payments into retirement savings. Analysis by Mr. Stevens suggests that someone in this position needs returns that are roughly equal to his or her borrowing cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stevens's final point will appeal to investors who are dead set against adding to their investments right now because of stock market volatility. In an analysis of TSX total returns since 1956 (dividends plus share price gains), he found that an especially opportune time to invest is after a down year for the markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Returns in the 12 months after a down year averaged 19 per cent, double the 11.1 per cent average for other times. The data doesn't suggest that your long-term results will be better if you invest after a down year, but you'll at least have the benefit of knowing that a very good year often follows a bad year. This, in turn, will help you stay focused on investing and resist the temptation to sell. “This is psychologically important,” Mr. Stevens said. “You're less likely to get off the roller coaster and say, ‘never again.'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My own advice: RRSPs beat a mortgage paydown in today's low-rate world, but credit cards and high-rate loans and lines of credit beat RRSPs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Get rid of that high-rate debt. Kill it dead.</p>

The lockout was supposed to dampen our appetite for the game, but it only heightened it. We defeat Germany in the World Junior Hockey Championship – it's front-page news! Hockey adorns our $5 bills. Our Prime Minister is writing a book.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Check out the media. Of all the grave issues and maladies afflicting humanity, guess what took up practically more page space in the past year or so than any of them? A debate over hockey head injuries. It's a serious problem, no doubt. But a priority?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remember the age-old debate over what constituted Canadian identity? It's over, Earthlings. The ballots are in. It's hockey. It's our religion, we're told. It's the culture. It's who we are. After 145 years of history, that's it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've written books on hockey and am a big fan, but isn't our perspective getting a little out of whack? While there's no disputing passionate interest in the sport, more kids play soccer than hockey, more adults play golf, and great waves of new Asian immigrants coming to our shores have little or no interest in the game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ken Campbell and Jim Parcels have just published an important book called Selling the Dream: How Hockey Parents and Their Kids are Paying the Price for Our National Obsession. They chronicle how countless numbers of parents, deluded by the hype, spend crazy amounts of money – money that should be saved for college educations – in the low-hope pursuit of the big dream for their kids. At age 9, they have them travelling to tournaments in Pittsburgh. They have them suited up for 70 games a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Hockey is and always will be an enormous part of the Canadian cultural fabric,” Mr. Campbell told Maclean's. “But I want people, when they read this book, to realize that it's time to dial things down a bit. Hockey has become almost too important in Canada; in a lot of ways, it's all we have.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, this country could do a lot worse than having hockey as its big deal. At least our identity isn't guns. As for giving Canada a philistine reputation, who says hockey is all that low-brow? Okay, Don Cherry's medieval version of the game certainly is. But in its purer form, hockey is artistic, demanding of quick strategic thinking and superior athletic talent. As for our kids' preoccupations, better the ice than the street corners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our reputation as the land of hockey will become more entrenched when Stephen Harper brings out his hockey book in the fall. Yep, the iceman writeth. And it's a fine idea, actually. It's a book about hockey's earliest days, in places like Dawson City, Yukon, and its formative characters, like Lord Stanley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a great way for Mr. Harper to connect with the public. But it's not a quickie book done for political purposes. He's been pecking away at it for years. It's diligently researched, I'm told, and scholarly. He has wisely tapped into Globe and Mail hockey sage Roy MacGregor for advice. In his consultant's role, Mr. MacGregor has had many sessions with Mr. Harper and come away impressed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The book will tell how the game took hold of Canada's psyche. It did indeed – and it has held it ever since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But is hockey the real Canadian identity? A big part of it, no doubt. But isn't our identity the land itself? Isn't that what makes Canada exceptional? Physically, no other country combines the mass and awe-inspiring beauty of this one. Russia is bigger, but if you have ever travelled its expanse, it doesn't compare with the grandeur you find here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The land, not the game, is what sets us apart. Hockey, on its frozen surfaces, is indelibly etched.</p>

Singapore, India and South Korea – as well as Greenpeace and the Association of Oil and Gas Producers – have also applied for observer status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, the melting of the sea ice and the opening up of new shipping routes linking the Pacific to the Atlantic, as well as the North's tremendous resource potential, are attracting a frenzy of attention. Canada, which this year becomes chair of the Arctic Council, has a unique opportunity to strengthen the leadership of the world's premier forum for intergovernmental co-operation in the North, just as global interest in the region intensifies.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under Canada's leadership, the council, which negotiates binding treaties, should seriously consider the observer applications of China, Korea and the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>. It's better to have China in the Arctic club that already exists; then it has to play by the rules and respect the sovereignty of the eight Arctic states that ring the North Pole. China, the world's top greenhouse gas emitter, has long had Arctic ambitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, the MP for Nunavut, is in some ways a surprising choice as Canada's representative to the council, despite her heritage. Finland, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, the U.S., Russia and Sweden are all represented by their foreign ministers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Ms. Aglukkaq, who attended a recent “Arctic Frontiers” conference in Tromso, Norway, has the benefit of having grown up in Nunavut. “If we are to successfully navigate the future of the Arctic, we must build bridges between people who live there and the new realities,” she told the meeting, a gathering of global politicians, scientists and industry representatives. She emphasized the need to promote development in the North, as well as to include Inuit traditional knowledge in scientific research. These are worthy goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said less about preserving the Arctic's ecosystem, which is part of the council's mandate. Climate change is occurring twice as fast there as elsewhere. In 10 years, the Arctic Ocean will be ice-free during the summer. The council should consider how best to reduce black carbon, or soot, which accelerates the melting of sea ice. “The Arctic faces environmental change and adaptation and Canada needs to go beyond just a state focus,” said Petra Dolata, a King's College, London professor who attended the conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Arctic is home to one-fifth of the world's fisheries – as well as 13 per cent of global undiscovered petroleum and 30 per cent of undiscovered natural gas. The extraction of these resources will only exacerbate climate change, and lead to possible territorial disputes, oil spills and an increased military presence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, Russia is building up its Northern Fleet to exploit the opening up of the Northern Sea Route, while Canada, in its own modest way, has also been rattling the ulu by strengthening its northern military capability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sustainability and safety of the North and its people must not be compromised by commercial activities. Any new voices on the council should not drown out those of Inuit, Sami and other aboriginal groups who already have permanent observer status, but no voting rights. It will be a difficult balancing act for Ms. Aglukkaq, but also a chance for Canada to enhance its global standing as a circumpolar leader.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former prime minister of Canada</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathleen Wynne's election on the weekend as leader of the Ontario Liberals means that 87 per cent of Canadians now reside in provinces and territories led by women. As someone who remains disappointed, 20 years on, that I've still been the only female prime minister, rather than just the first one, I celebrate this important democratic milestone.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Half a dozen female premiers reinforces the message that women belong in politics. Their visibility will change the landscape of Canadian politics and our sense of what is “normal” in public life. But having six female premiers should not make us prematurely complacent. They are still only the tip of an iceberg, the main body of which (75 per cent at all levels of political representation) is unfortunately still overwhelmingly male.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why should we care about the representation of women? Women's lives reflect a different set of experiences that need to be represented in our democratic deliberations. Moreover, a growing body of research reveals the importance of diversity in decision-making. All-male organizations can breed a hierarchical, testosterone-infused social dynamic that requires displays of machismo and the kind of risk-taking that helped fuel the financial collapse of a few years ago. Women are not better than men, but there is overwhelming evidence of the value they add in business and government when they have a chance to lead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Globally, the empowerment of women is more and more recognized as the sine qua non of social, political and economic progress – even in domains traditionally seen as the province of men. <span class="companylink">UN Security Council</span> Resolution 1325 and its follow-ups call for women's participation in postconflict negotiations, not out of political correctness but to ensure successful peace processes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In legislatures where women work across party lines, there is a clear effect on the legislative agenda. U.S. research suggests that the presence of even one woman on a court can influence its culture toward greater openness. In Canada, the presence of female MPs – including myself as Justice Minister – not only facilitated the revision of sexual-assault legislation but contributed to a more balanced culture in the House of Commons, making it possible for our male colleagues to stand up with us and speak with sensitivity about the issue, precisely because Parliament was no longer a men's club.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For these and other reasons, we need to join the increasing number of countries that see gender as a basic default category of society. In polities with proportional representation, parity is often achieved simply by alternating male and female candidates on the party lists. This has enabled many countries to far outstrip Canada in creating gender parity. Our single-member, first-past-the-post electoral system presents a greater challenge for achieving this goal. When Equal Voice, an organization dedicated to electing more women in Canada, honoured me with its EVE Award four years ago, I proposed redrawing electoral boundaries so that every constituency in Canada would become a two-member constituency. (I was elected to the Legislative Assembly of B.C. from a two-member riding, so this is not an untried approach.) If each redrawn constituency were tasked with electing one man and one woman – each elector would have two votes – we would have instant parity in Parliament. It would simply and fairly solve the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Committing to gender parity would also change the sense of what is just in Canada and what is possible for Canadian women. It would be an example to the rest of the world – an ingenious way, without quotas or affirmative action, to address the gender balance. It would also challenge women to step up and run for office, to present Canadians with the broadest set of options and to help populate the rest of the iceberg with more balanced perspectives and experiences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kim Campbell is a member of Equal Voice's National Advisory Board, an honorary patron of Informed Opinions and actively involved in numerous international organizations promoting effective governance and democracy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ana Bailao is a nice woman. Everyone at city hall likes her. Since voters elected her to represent Ward 18-Davenport in 2010, she has earned a reputation for being an earnest, thoughtful and hard-working city councillor.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on Oct. 15 she made a terrible mistake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After attending the Mayor's Ball for the Arts that night, she went for drinks at the Thompson hotel on Bathurst Street. Afterward, she took a cab to her car and started driving home. Police noticed her headlights were off and pulled her over. A breathalyzer test registered a blood-alcohol reading of .13, well above the legal limit of .08.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few days later, she made a second mistake. At a city hall news conference, she said she intended to plead not guilty to drinking and driving charges. “These charges will in no way affect my ability to do the job I was elected to do,” she said then. Fellow councillors of all stripes flocked to her side. “Everyone makes mistakes,” said Doug Ford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“She's an amazing councillor,” said Frances Nunziata.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Ms. Bailao admits her decision to plead not guilty was wrong. “The media pressure was unrelenting and I was getting advice from dozens of people,” she told reporters on Monday. “I listened to that advice instead of listening to my heart.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After thinking it over, she decided to plead guilty instead and went to court earlier Monday. She will lose the right to drive for a year and pay a fine of $1,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bailao seems genuinely contrite, and her apology “for the hurt and offence I have caused others” appeared heartfelt. She was often in tears as she spoke. “I need to do this to be okay with my conscience and my heart,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Rob Ford gave her credit. “She did something wrong. She owned up to it. That's the right thing to do. And she's a good councillor and she takes care of her constituents well,” he told reporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the whole sad episode speaks to the way we often view drunk driving – not as a real crime, but as an unfortunate but perhaps understandable indiscretion. Why else would her colleagues have rallied to her side without having any idea what happened that night?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite all the years of public education about drunk driving – all the gory ads on TV, all the pleas by bereaved families, all the police spot checks – an astounding number of people still get behind the wheel while under the influence. MADD Canada, which fights drunk driving, puts the number of impaired driving trips each year at 12.5-million. It says the number of people killed annually by drunk driving is between 1,250 and 1,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Penalties are more severe than they once were, and police much more serious about catching drunk drivers. But many of us still think we can handle a car with a few drinks under our belt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bailao says she felt in control when she made the decision to drive that night. She now says she realizes that no matter how in-control you feel, “one drink is too many.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The only thing I ask is for people to learn from my example. The decisions you make in a single moment can have life-altering consequences.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too true, but those words would have carried more weight if she had recognized her special role as an elected official, admitted fault at the beginning and taken the rap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, she waited three months before having her fit of conscience and deciding to plead guilty.</p>

The country, with its primitive human-rights record, its fanatical anti-Israel chest-thumping and its medieval theocracy, claims it successfully shot a monkey 120 kilometres into the sky this week, and is boasting of the accomplishment. The monkey launch follows, we are told, similar successes with a turtle, a rat and some worms; the goal is to send a man up there by 2019, and to build an Iranian space station after that.</p>

It's a very 21st-century accomplishment that advances mankind's exploration of space. Dextre sounds as if it could have caught that Iranian monkey, given it a haircut, returned it to its rocket and handed it a juice box for the ride home. How Canada has accomplished something so sophisticated while allowing religious freedom, embracing democracy and promoting peace must be a mystery to Iran's leaders.

Alberta is not the only place where an entrenched political culture produces enduring mistakes, but it's the one in the headlines – again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's political culture is about low taxes and big spending. The province has the lowest taxes in Canada – the so-called Alberta Advantage – and it's at or near the top in terms of per capita spending on government programs such as health care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Filling the gap between the low taxes and munificent services are revenues from oil and natural gas. These revenues account on average for 30 per cent of Alberta's budget. These revenues fluctuate with world prices, North American energy markets and other factors beyond the province's control. Unsteady prices lie at the heart of the “boom and bust” plague of Alberta's economy – and its budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albertans ought to know in their bones about “boom and bust.” They've lived it before. But their governments don't do anything about it, in large part because they're creatures of a political culture in which citizens enjoy the fairyland of low taxes and large government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When times were good and non-renewable resource revenues were buoyant, Alberta governments systematically refused to plow into the Heritage Fund. As a result, the fund contains a piddling amount relative to what it could have become. The province built a Sustainability Fund to cover downturns in revenues, but that's shrivelling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once again, the prices for Alberta's non-renewable resources are dropping. Natural gas prices are very low and will stay there courtesy of new supplies. A glut of North American oil (so much for the End of Oil folly) means Alberta's bitumen oil has to be sold at a huge discount, costing the province billions of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Alberta needs is a steadier source of revenue to fund its basic government services – namely, a provincial sales tax of the kind found everywhere else in Canada. With such a tax, Alberta's revenues would be much more stable, and more money from non-renewable resources could be placed into the Heritage Fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked whether he thought a sales tax was necessary, a former Alberta finance minister laughed off the idea with a political reaction: “They'd hang me from a lamppost.” He was certainly correct, given the province's political culture. Even today, with the same unheeded lesson about volatile revenues from non-renewable resources again plaguing the province, Premier Alison Redford says: “It is not good enough to take the easy way out and raise taxes.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So how about other easy ways out? Like borrowing more money to fill deficit holes. Or fooling people by saying that finding “efficiencies” in government services can fill gaps of billions of dollars. Or make-believe stories of the kind the Premier is peddling – that more money can go into the Heritage Fund without higher taxes, yet with more investment in the two biggest items in the provincial budget: health care and education. This is the easy way out of problems: Avoid them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Redford – who, in a conference call with supporters on Monday night, neither ruled in nor out a sales tax – has promised to hold the first Alberta Economic Summit next month. She should save the money and reread a major report commissioned by her predecessor, Ed Stelmach, into her province's future. The Premier's Council for Economic Strategy reflected the collected wisdom of a group of Albertans and people from the rest of Canada and the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That 2011 report warned (as others had before) of precisely the situation in which Alberta now finds itself. Relying so heavily on oil and natural gas revenues to fund current expenditures is a “risk to the province's future.” Albertans, the report said, must “face up to the reality that every public service comes at a cost and that current expenditures should be financed by current revenue.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report was dead on arrival because it challenged an unreceptive political culture. The report was correct: The culture needs to change. But how?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kids today. One imagines that certain nuances of the recent past are lost on them. Such as the mood of the Cold War, the notoriety of the KGB, the arrival of glasnost in the Soviet Union and the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a fair assertion, I think. You have to have lived through at least part of it to grasp the texture and tenor of it all. That means that The Americans (FX Canada, 10 p.m.), a new and fine drama, is meant for adults. And by that I mean it's not just that the opening scene involves a woman seducing a man in a bar, and having sex with him in a hotel room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Americans is anchored in an intriguing concept. It's the early 1980s. Ronald Reagan has just been elected president of the United States. In Washington of the time we meet Elizabeth and Phillip Jennings (Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys), a couple-with-kids living in the suburbs. They seem nice, unremarkable people. They own a travel agency and are solidly middle-class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are, in fact, KGB spies. Part of a sleeper cell planted in the U.S. years before, their real mission is to gather intelligence, help and groom other agents, and deliver info back to their KGB bosses. The election of Reagan has complicated their situation. Cold War tension has heightened. A Soviet Union official declares to one of them, “the American people have elected a madman as their president, and he makes no secret of his desire to destroy us.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the start, The Americans is working on multiple levels. First, Elizabeth and Phillip are ostensibly the heroes, figures of sympathy for the viewer. Second, the early eighties atmosphere is compelling – so near yet so far from us. The music seems recent and yet there are no cellphones or laptops. Third, we are witnessing an arranged marriage – the couple were united by KGB bosses, not by love or empathy. It's a union under severe strain as it emerges that Elizabeth is the hardliner, a KGB lifer, and Phillip is mildly fed up with their mission. Fourth, they may have aroused the suspicion of a new neighbour and are desperate not to be exposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus we get a thriller that's also about a marriage on the brink of rupture. The marriage is also the Cold War distilled – Elizabeth will cling to communism forever, but the pleasures of the West gnaw at Phillip's resolve. And we do feel for the family. The kids are completely unaware of their parents' real tasks in life and that their doting mom and dad could flee or be arrested at any moment. There are flashbacks to Elizabeth and Phillip in Russia, being trained for the mission. There are bewildering events at night, car chases and last-second escapes from American authorities who know that there are Soviet spies in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keri Russell has the juicy role here and she's fabulous – the strong woman in a marriage that is profoundly demanding. There's a scene, early on, which has her assert her KGB training and kick a guy's head through a wall. It's only plasterboard but, Jiminy, it's thrilling. And Russell is clearly relishing a role that's very distant from the coming-of-age drama Felicity, which made her a TV star, way back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the evidence of two episodes seen, The Americans (created by Joe Weisberg, a former <span class="companylink">CIA</span> official who also writes for the series Damages) is not Homeland. That is, it's about spying but it doesn't have the propulsive pace and urgent intensity of Homeland. It sprawls a bit (some of the scenes in Russia seem hurriedly done) and takes its time to find focus. But there's a vast wealth of rich material here. The show is compelling, odd and definitely for adults, because, really you had to be there, in those Reagan years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jon Stovell has taken the pulse of the Janion building in Victoria's Old Town and deems the derelict structure worth saving.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While others are daunted by the decay, he welcomes the challenge of preserving and rehabilitating the three-storey brick building on a gritty corner of downtown Victoria. The Janion was built in 1891 and had a varied life as everything from a hotel to a warehouse, but it has been vacant for more than 35 years. “When we see Old Town, we see miraculous potential for retaining beautiful heritage buildings in what could become an incredibly vibrant area,” said Mr. Stovell, president of Reliance Properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reliance, with the help of Merrick Architecture in Victoria, plans to restore the run-down Janion and turn it into a condo complex that will house 113 microlofts. Old Town has its charms, but the neighbourhood lacks a concentration of residents who are needed to breathe new life into the area. Old Town has survived a long period of decline, marked by high vacancy rates in aging buildings or, in the case of the Janion, decades of neglect. “You need a dense population base that will drive people into the nooks and crannies. It is such an amazing opportunity,” said Mr. Stovell, a former president of the Gastown Business Improvement Association in Vancouver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To attract a new crowd of condo dwellers who will embrace the notion that small is beautiful (and affordable), Reliance plans to offer Janion units at a starting price of $110,000 for a humble abode of 248 square feet – roughly the size of a one-car garage. While some units will be more than 800 square feet, the average will be 360 square feet. About half of the microlofts are to be offered for less than $150,000 each, featuring built-in flat-screen TVs and flip-up wall beds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty-six of the condo units will be in the original Janion on Store Street. Behind the brick building, the remaining 87 units will be located in a six-storey wing to be built on former <span class="companylink">Transport Canada</span> land that slopes down to the waterfront, just north of the Johnson Street Bridge. Work on the Janion project is slated to begin this summer, with completion targeted by the end of 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vancouver-based Reliance, which acquired the Janion property last year, is also keen to revitalize two historic Victoria warehouses known as Northern Junk. Those two structures, dating back to the 1860s, are on the south side of the blue-coloured Johnson Street Bridge. The aging crossing itself will be torn down after a new one opens in 2016 in a $92-million bridge project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within four years or so, Reliance hopes to convert the long-abandoned warehouses into restaurants with patios and also create a waterfront boardwalk that would be open to the public. The developer is proposing to construct a five-storey complex on Wharf Street that would hold 59 condo units aimed at higher-end buyers. “Jon Stovell is making a dramatic statement in his foray into the Victoria market,” said Shaun McIntyre, a managing associate at Merrick Architecture, which has been hired for the Janion and Northern Junk projects. Mr. McIntyre is the project lead for Northern Junk while his colleague, Darryl Jonas, is the designer for the Janion venture. Paul Merrick is the design consultant for both Old Town properties, formerly owned by a Victoria family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Old Town, including Lower Johnson (or LoJo for short), Mr. McIntyre and Mr. Jonas sense a budding renaissance. Many Old Town businesses have struggled over the years, as local consumers shifted to shopping malls such as Uptown in suburban Saanich and even big-box stores in the nearby City of Langford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Merchants in Victoria's historic core stand to benefit from an influx of residents, notably shops in Market Square and Chinatown. Another Old Town condo project getting under way is the Union development by Anthem Properties. Nearby merchants include Mountain Equipment Co-op, a <span class="companylink">Lululemon</span> yoga-wear outlet, a variety of boutique shops and independent restaurants. Monty's Exotic Showroom Pub, a long-time strip joint on Pandora Avenue, closed two weeks ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preservationists have criticized the size and scope of the new five-storey structure envisaged for what is currently public land in front of the Northern Junk site. “People in Victoria really are quite passionate about preserving their heritage and they're very protective of Old Town,” said Steve Barber, senior heritage planner for the City of Victoria. City planners support the developer's vision for the condos, noting that some buildings were demolished in the 1960s on Wharf Street. The Northern Junk condos would fit within the historical context of Old Town, Mr. Barber argues.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major League Baseball will survive the revelations published in a South Florida-based alternative weekly that link several players to a Miami clinic shown to have distributed performance-enhancing drugs, including human growth hormone, synthetic testosterone and other substances banned by baseball.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative (BALCO) scandal, which ensnared Barry Bonds among others, this time, commissioner Bud Selig has his own paper trail of suspensions and a drug-testing system that, while not enough to satisfy the skeptics, is a statement of awareness that never existed during the bad, old days of Mark McGwire blubbering in front of a U.S. Congressional subcommittee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alex Rodriguez, however, won't be so lucky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, if you listen quietly, you can hear the sound of the few remaining shreds of his reputation disappearing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That other sound might be lawyers for the <span class="companylink">New York Yankees</span> rifling through his contract, which has five years and $114-million (U.S.) remaining, trying to figure out documents given to the Miami New Times by a disgruntled employee of a Miami-based clinic called Biogenesis purporting to show Rodriguez paid for HGH, testosterone cream and IGF-1, a substance that stimulates insulin production, as recently as last spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rodriguez, who could miss the entire season due to hip surgery, has said in interviews he stopped using PEDs after 2003. He issued a statement Tuesday disavowing any relationship with the man in charge of the clinic, Anthony Bosch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report is only as legitimate as the list of dates and names given to the New Times, and other players listed in the report – such <span class="companylink">Washington Nationals</span> pitcher Gio Gonzalez – also issued denials. In Gonzalez's case, his father, Max, came forward to say that he – not his son – had used the clinic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other players named included <span class="companylink">Toronto Blue Jays</span> outfielder Melky Cabrera, <span class="companylink">Texas Rangers</span> outfielder Nelson Cruz and <span class="companylink">San Diego Padres</span> catcher Yasmani Grandal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is that same paper trail that offers solace for Blue Jays fans who were probably taken aback seeing Cabrera's name among the list of players supposedly serviced by Bosch and Biogenesis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cabrera signed a two-year, $18-million (U.S.) free-agent contract with Toronto this winter, after being suspended for 50 games and missing out on the <span class="companylink">San Francisco Giants</span>' 2012 World Series run due to a failed drug test that showed elevated levels of testosterone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The notes given to the New Times referring to Cabrera are dated Dec. 21, 2011, and include a hand-written note from Bosch expressing anger at Cabrera for $9,000 Bosch says he is owed. “In helping him, I put my business and all my doctors at risk by fabricating patient charts and phony prescriptions,” the paper cites Bosch as complaining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blue Jays general manager Alex Anthopoulos did not respond to an e-mail request for an interview Tuesday, and Cabrera's agents, Sam and Seth Levinson, did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major League Baseball issued a release noting three of the players linked to the clinic had in fact been suspended by baseball – a reference to Cabrera, suggesting there was no evidence Cabrera did business with the clinic since his suspension ended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At any rate, make no mistake: The focus is on Rodriguez, because this may be his BALCO.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Baseball couldn't make Bonds go away because he was on the verge of breaking Hank Aaron's all-time home-run record, so the sport held its nose as one of the game's most polarizing personalities of all time continued his climb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bonds found solace in a hometown crowd in San Francisco that overlooked his flaws in favour of enjoying a once in a lifetime statistical ride.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Rodriguez is disliked almost as much by Yankees fans as he is by fans on the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simply put: there isn't a person in the game who would care if A-Rod never returns to the game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a huge fall for a player who was considered the heir to Bonds's home-run title, and it now seems as if baseball's steroid scandal morphs from a pox-on-all-their-houses thing to one of personal responsibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bonds's transgressions were pre-testing era; this suggests at least some of A-Rod's were post-testing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You thought Bonds was a pariah? Wait until you see what's left of A-Rod when this is done.</p>

To the unadventurous beer drinker, imperial stouts can seem as treacherous as a highway coated with February slush. But these big bruisers of the beer world offer one of the richest and most rewarding experiences in a pint glass.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often brewed in small batches during the colder months, they are tailor-made for this time of year, with velvety texture, heart-warming alcohol that typically reaches 9 or 10 per cent and nuances that include dark chocolate, dried dark fruit and smoke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many imperial stout fans, I think of them as winter beers, a loose grouping that also usually includes – depending on whom you ask – Scotch ales, barley wines, double IPAs and dark ales flavoured with fruit, coffee or baking spices. I'd also throw in oatmeal stout, a more modest-alcohol dark brew that derives its exceptional smoothness from oats. If Coors Light were pinot grigio, winter beers would be more like cabernet sauvignon or vintage port.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imperial stout gets its name from the imperial court of Catherine the Great in Russia, where London brewers of the late 18th century found a thirsty market for an especially robust, hoppy style based on dark-roasted barley malt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A couple of centuries later, craft breweries in North America are making it fashionable among quality-beer hounds on these shores, with more imperial stout produced in the United States than any other country, according to the Oxford Companion to Beer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of my new favourites hails from British Columbia, and goes by the arresting name Pothole Filler. Made by Howe Sound Brewing in Squamish, it's a tarry tribute to builders of the local Sea-to-Sky Highway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roasted barley conveys a strong sense of chocolate, supported by a sweet-bitter tension coming from blackstrap molasses and a high hop content. “We use a whack of roasted malt, crystal malt and molasses,” head brewer Franco Corno says. “We wanted it inky black.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I also highly recommend the drier <span class="companylink">Shipyard Brewing</span> Imperial Porter from Portland, Me., and spicy Russian Gun Imperial Stout from Grand River Brewing in Cambridge, Ont., the latter named for the Queen's Square Cannon gifted to the old town of Galt by Britain to honour local troops who fought in the Crimean War of the 1850s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you find their heavy alcohol (7.1 and 8 per cent, respectively) intimidating, I'd suggest the superbly balanced, 5-per-cent Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout, a glorious introduction to the dark side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a lighter, or at least lighter-coloured, vein, Scotch ale often comes across to me as though it has one toe in the whisky world, which makes it ideal for winter. The style is a nod to an era when brewers heated barley and water over open flames. The resulting caramelized malt added toffee-like sweetness, akin to the flavour imparted to whisky by charred oak barrels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some brewers even add peat-smoked malts to the mix, echoing the heady aroma of pungent Islay scotches, such as Laphroaig and Lagavulin. That's the case with the excellent St. Peter's The Saints Whisky Beer, a British rarity that also includes a splash of whisky. “It tastes like it's got a shot of Laphroaig in it,” says Chris Harper, owner of the new Toronto hot spot Pharmacy, an antique-wood-lined place housed in a former drugstore on a gritty stretch of King Street West that used to do brisk business dispensing methadone to recovering addicts. (The weathered “Pharmacy” sign is the only clue to the new tonics administered within.) “Two supermodels came in and they were drinking bourbon, and I gave them a bottle [of St. Peter's] and they were floored. They were, like, ‘This is amazing.'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though he received only a tiny allotment of The Saints Whisky Beer, a few of Harper's other seasonally limited offerings include Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout from New York, Mill St. Vanilla Porter from Toronto and Beau's Winterbrewed, an amber ale from Vankleek Hill, Ont., infused with coffee. “I got the vanilla porter in for the girls, but it seems like the guys are into it,” he says. “I find it tastes like Toblerone, though not too sweet.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mirella Amato, who runs a Toronto-based beer-tasting and consulting company called Beerology and was recently named Canada's first Master Cicerone (brewing's analogue to a master sommelier), prefers hearty winter beers on their own. But she says many can pair nicely with cheeses. “Barley wine is a classic with blue cheese,” she says of the style named for its near-wine-like high alcoholic strength. Most barley wines are amber-coloured rather than dark and were originally consumed at the table in lieu of their grape-based namesake when the latter grew scarce in England because of periods of tense relations with France.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Rhino Bar on Toronto's Queen Street West, Chris Starr, a manager, extends his winter-brew definition to include so-called double IPAs, the exceptionally bitter, turbocharged variants of an already bitter style known as India pale ale. He is now featuring 9.5-per-cent-alcohol Rogue I2PA from Oregon as part of the bar's 300-strong beer selection. That number will expand by at least 18 on Feb. 10, when Rhino will host its inaugural one-day winter beer festival, featuring an assortment of Ontario craft brands, some brewed specifically for the occasion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to spiced brews, Starr, like me, is a fan of Great Lakes Winter Ale (cinnamon, honey, ginger and orange) and Black Oak Nutcracker Porter (cinnamon), both from Ontario. “Another one that's done very well for us is Granville Lions Winter Ale,” he says, referring to an offering from Vancouver. “It's got big mocha notes and vanilla.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's no Pothole Filler, but it can certainly make the glide through winter a little smoother.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time in years, there is bipartisan support in the U.S. to create a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants who live there. This isn't just the right thing to do; it will bring significant benefits to the economy, raise tax revenues and inject a spirit of entrepreneurialism, innovation and youthful energy into the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Barack Obama's decision to spend his political capital in his second term on “comprehensive, common-sense” immigration reform is a shrewd one. It could be the most important accomplishment of his polarized presidency, with an impact felt for years to come. For now, Mr. Obama is throwing his weight behind a bipartisan Senate proposal, which advocates better border security, and a guaranteed path to citizenship for those who come out from the shadows, pay a fine and back taxes, and join the back of the line of other prospective immigrants.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, given the inflamed passions around the issue, the President is also smart to have a backup plan; if the Senate proposal fails to gain traction, he will introduce his own bill in Congress and force a quick vote. “We define ourselves as a nation of immigrants,” he said in his address in Las Vegas. “Immigrants have helped start businesses like <span class="companylink">Google</span> and <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span>… Today our out-of-date and badly broken immigration system is holding us back.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate blueprint, released on Monday by four Republican and four Democrat senators, outlines the need to first crack down on illegal immigration, as well as on employers who knowingly hire those without work papers. Once these goals are accomplished, it sets out a path to citizenship for the undocumented, as well as a new law to award those with advanced degrees in science and technology from U.S. universities a green card.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last overhaul to U.S. immigration laws was in 1986, and until recently, the Republican Party remained defiantly opposed. However, with the Hispanic community's overwhelming rejection of Mitt Romney in the election, many in the party have wisely shifted their position. Mr. Romney, the Republican candidate, drew the support of just 27 per cent of Latino voters, compared with Mr. Obama's 71 per cent. As the President reminded Americans, it is easy to adopt an “us-versus-them” mentality, until you remember that “most of us used to be them.” This sensible reform is long overdue.</p>

They are a net benefit to Canada. Occupy that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Occupy movement in Canada never really took off, for many reasons. Its goals were unclear and its methods grated, especially on neighbours of occupied spaces. But maybe, just maybe, there was another reason: The top 1 per cent of earners is not really a problem in Canada.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And why should it be? There is no wall around it. Over a five-year period, nearly half of the 1 per cent dropped out, to be replaced by others, according to a Statistics Canada paper released this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the 1 per cent is not some distant speck of light in some far-off universe. The lowest earner in the group earned $201,400 (the figure includes job earnings, investment income and pensions) in 2010. And like many a despised group before them, they defy stereotyping. Forty-two per cent of the 1 per cent don't even have a university degree. Not many are investment bankers. A good number are doctors, dentists and veterinarians, and others are managers, according to a separate paper from the <span class="companylink">University of British Columbia</span>, based on the 2005 census. (Presumably, some are entrepreneurs.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top echelon of earners in Canada has nowhere near the share of national income of the 16.8 per cent controlled by their counterparts in the United States. In fact, the 1 per cent in Canada has lost a little ground from its top mark of 12.1 per cent in 2006. (Yes, we know; we'll take up a collection.) And what is the “right” level for the 1 per cent? One per cent? In Sweden, which some consider a model of equality, the top 1 per cent of earners in 2007 had 7 per cent of the income. At 10.6 per cent, Canada is closer to egalitarian Sweden than to the unequal U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in Sweden, though, people say that making lots of money is an incentive to work. With globalization of everything – business, education, labour – the higher end will move higher. We still need to do our best as a society to ensure equality of opportunity, to reduce child poverty, to create good schools for everyone. The Statistics Canada paper suggests the 1 per cent are doing their part to pay for that.</p>

He is to fly down the left wing of hockey rinks, back arched like an attacking hawk, and he is to lift people out of their seats with shots so hard goalies cannot see them or moves so breathtaking defencemen can only see them later on highlight reels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only, it doesn't quite happen the way it once did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest cheer the <span class="companylink">Washington Capitals</span> star heard Tuesday night was when he was nailed for slashing new NHL sensation Erik Karlsson early in the third period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it was Karlsson who, late in the third period on an Ottawa power play, made the pass to Sergei Gonchar that gave the Senators a 3-2 comeback victory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The player who has been one of two faces of the NHL since the 2004-05 lockout – Pittsburgh captain Sidney Crosby the other, of course – has not shone as might be expected since the latest lockout. In this he is hardly alone among the elite players of the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it took him five games to score his first, an overtime goal against <span class="companylink">Buffalo Sabres</span> last Sunday. Since 2005, his 12 career OT goals are the most scored by anyone in the league. He has scored more goals (340) and points (661) than anyone else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, however, the Capitals captain slipped slightly, falling to fifth in league with 38 goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is 27 now, his thick black hair salted slightly on the edges. The Stanley Cup he was expected to deliver to the Capitals has not come (whereas Crosby has his).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Capitals, once the shining team of the east, have struggled early in a shortened season where small struggles can strangle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Capitals were 1-3-1 when they arrived in Ottawa to take on the Senators – and urgency was as much in the air as the threat of freezing rain. It remains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“No chance to have a grace period,” said forward Troy Brouwer, who promptly scored the Capitals' first goal on a first-period rush where he and Ottawa goaltender Craig Anderson seemed to juggle a Wojtek Wolski pass before the puck somehow found its way into the net.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington went ahead 2-0, when Matt Hendricks managed to tip a floater from Jay Beagle that also slipped past Anderson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ovechkin tried, but nothing was quite working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Of course, I want to be in the position where I score goals and help my team win,” he had said prior to the match. “If I have an opportunity to score, I have to score.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had but one good opportunity Tuesday and could not make it count.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brouwer says the early shakes are understandable. “In just over a year,” he said, “we've had three coaches, three different styles.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce Boudreau was replaced by Dale Hunter, who elected to forgo the NHL life for his junior hockey empire in London, Ont. Hall-of-Famer Adam Oates is now in his first head coaching job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked if believed his charges turned a needed corner against Buffalo, Oates said: “I hope so – the win is important. You want to string a few in a row and get some confidence.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That now will have to wait.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senators, on the other hand, were on the verge of a third consecutive loss when they mounted their comeback. It was in itself somewhat unexpected as the team had been loudly booed by the home fans in the second period for uninspired play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the booing triggered something, as they were able to cut the lead to 2-1 when Jim O'Brien, the team's hardest working player Tuesday, managed to tip a pass from Erik Condra in behind Washington goaltender Michal Neuvirth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa was without its best forward, Jason Spezza, out with an “upper body” injury. His place was taken by young prospect Mika Zibanejad, who was called up from the AHL only the day before. The 19-year-old Swede acquitted himself well, picking up an assist on O'Brien's goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senators tied the game 2-2 early in the third period, when Milan Michalek flicked a harmless backhand Neuvirth's way after a faceoff and somehow the puck found the back of the net.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then Gonchar decided the game, beautifully set up by Karlsson for a blast from the point that Neuvirth could not handle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ovechkin's case, he is at least now more content than early in the season, when Oates decided to switch the Russian superstar from his customary left wing position to the right wing. It hadn't panned out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I was on the right side I was a little confused, a little bit lost,” Ovechkin said. “But, again, we make some changes. I tell [Oates] I am more comfortable playing left side than right side.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That's his comfort zone, for sure,” Oates said. “We want him to score goals and he got the winner for us the other night. He could have had four. To me, if you're doing that, you get the opportunity and you're playing well, he got the chances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm really not worried about it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others, however, surely are.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Jan. 29, 2012, a jury in Kingston, Ont., found Afghan-born Mohammad Shafia, his wife Tooba Yahya Mohammad and son Hamed guilty in the 2009 murders of daughters Geeti, Sahar and Zeinab, and Mr. Shafia's first wife, Rona Amir Mohammad. It was a trial that repulsed our sensibilities: The women were killed to preserve family “honour.” The teenage daughters' behaviour had become “too Western” for the parents to bear; the patriarch cursed them even after their deaths.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four deaths pointed to a disturbing national trend. Research by University of Sherbrooke professor Anne-Marie Robert indicated that 16 women have been victims of honour killings in Canada between 1999 and 2009, compared with three between 1954 and 1983. The average victim was 21; the killers were immigrants – usually male – and primarily of Sikh or Muslim background.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The past three trials have pointed to another troublesome pattern: direct participation by the victim's brother in her murder. While there have been no honour killings recorded since 2009, community groups say the number of incidents involving honour-based violence has increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such alarming trends should prompt a national policy to deal with the issue. But none has been officially forthcoming – aside from cosmetic changes to Canada's guide to new immigrants in which honour killings are called “barbaric.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to <span class="companylink">University of Toronto</span> sociologist Anne Korteweg, Germany, the Netherlands and Britain have crafted national policies of “prevention, protection and prosecution” to address honour-based violence. Canada, however, lacks a systematic approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be fair, there has been a shift in legal policy, as the Crown has explicitly brought forth the motive of honour in its past three successful prosecutions. The 100-per-cent conviction rate under the Criminal Code suggests there's no need for any amendment to specifically target crimes of honour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A robust policy of prevention and protection should complement the legal successes, so fewer trials actually occur. Prevention and protection are inextricably linked, as community-based groups, social service agencies and law enforcement will have to work together to combat the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This co-operative model is already in place in London, Ont., with last year's launch of the Family Honour Project by the Muslim Resource Centre for Social Support and Integration (MRCSSI). Research has been conducted into honour-based violence, risk factors have been ascertained, and stakeholders have been brought together from the local community, law enforcement and social service agencies. A pilot program is set to roll out this year. The MRCSSI is co-ordinating its efforts with Chicago's Cure Violence program, which addresses gang violence based on the paradigm of treating violence as a disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of prevention and protection, the MRCSSI is building on its programs that help immigrant families. According to the MRCSSI, for example, there has been a 73-per-cent reduction in the number of Muslim children in local foster care since 2007, with no new cases in the past three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key preventive component is the role of community leaders in speaking up against honour-based violence, and all forms of domestic violence. The MRCSSI has galvanized local imams to broach this topic in sermons and community workshops; it's also promoting a powerful video against honour killings, co-produced by the Palestinian hip-hop group DAM and UN Women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is also happening at the national level. Kingston imam Sikander Hashmi (a former journalist) has taken a prominent role in addressing this issue in Muslim communities across Canada. Muneeb Nasir, president of Toronto's Olive Tree Foundation, has spearheaded the first White Ribbon campaign in the Muslim community, with hundreds of signatories pledging to stop violence against women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2011, mosques across the country have joined the dialogue on violence against women by devoting at least one Friday sermon to the topic. And community groups are organizing workshops to increase awareness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Muslim communities are beginning to take responsibility in addressing this issue in a forthright manner and in seeking ways to co-operate with government agencies to find solutions. What will help move this forward is leadership at the federal level to craft a comprehensive policy on honour-based violence in partnership with all stakeholders.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saturday, February 02, 2013</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A column Wednesday on crimes of “honour” quoted a University of Sherbrooke professor's research on the number of honour killings in Canada between 1999 and 2009. The column incorrectly set the number at 16 when the research related to 12 deaths. The professor's name was incorrectly stated as Anne-Marie Robert when in fact her name is Marie-Pierre Robert. In addition, <span class="companylink">University of Toronto</span> sociologist Anna Korteweg was also quoted. Her name was misspelled as Anne in the article.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be morally sound, and in Canada's self-interest, to offer more logistical support to France's offensive against al-Qaeda-linked militants in Mali.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Harper government has extended the tour of a C-17 heavy-lift transport plane shuttling equipment from France to Mali but says it won't join combat operations there. France has the only Western military force in combat zones, along with the undisciplined Malian army and some badly equipped and insufficiently trained West African contingents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Mali is relatively unknown, many Canadians might have a knee-jerk reaction against intervention. But they would be mistaken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mali, to a certain degree, is what Afghanistan was in 2001: a failed state that has become a haven for terrorists intent on waging a holy war against the West. But, this time, the threat is much closer to Europe (and even North America) – just a short flight to Spain or Italy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Americans are sending in drones, and Britain and Canada are willing to play a back-up role. True to form, most European governments, while verbally supportive of the French initiative, have shied away from providing logistical help, let alone troops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northern Mali has been a lawless zone since a military coup toppled the Malian government in March of 2012. It is part of the Sahel, a huge arid area bordering the Sahara desert where former Canadian diplomats Robert Fowler and Louis Guay were seized in late 2008 and held for four months by a group called al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. AQIM has joined forces with Tuareg secessionists and various jihadist groups that have inflicted a brutal Taliban-like regime on northern Mali's moderate Muslim population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actually, this intervention in Mali is a case of the chickens coming home to roost. France is now trying to clean up the damage resulting from its ill-advised 2011 war against Moammar Gadhafi's regime – a regime that had stopped being a threat outside its frontiers for more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shifting and dangerous situation in northern Mali is, in part, a direct consequence of the Libyan adventure, in which Canada and the U.S. acted as witless partners. Under the impulsive guidance of then French president Nicolas Sarkozy, NATO foolishly intervened in what was really a civil war. Far from being innocent peaceniks calling for democracy, the rebels based in Benghazi were mounting an armed putsch against the regime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was known at the time that Benghazi and the eastern part of Libya were a hotbed of Islamic fundamentalism and that rebel forces had been infiltrated by jihadists – something that became tragically clear last fall when the American ambassador was killed in the very city the U.S. vowed to “liberate” in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Libya imploded, the Tuaregs – who had been some of Col. Gadhafi's fiercest fighters – went to Mali, bringing with them countless arms pillaged from Col. Gadhafi's huge arsenal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although an Islamist government has succeeded Col. Gadhafi's secular regime, it's unable to control the country, which is divided among heavily armed militias fighting against each other. The jihadists who recently invaded Algeria's In Amenas gas site looking for foreign workers to fuel their lucrative hostage-taking operation came from Libya.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world has forgotten about Libya. The international press corps has vanished, pursuing more dramatic fronts such as Syria or – again – Egypt, leaving behind the chaos that's spilling into Mali and risks inflaming the entire Sahel.</p>

The new government is unlikely to have medium-term consequences that favour greater stability in the Middle East. Nonetheless, the success of the new Yesh Atid party is remarkable and encouraging – the name itself, “There is a future,” is a resonant message in a country exposed to existential threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From outside Israel, the main issues in that country appear to be questions of war and peace. In this election, however, for the first time in decades, foreign policy was not at the centre of the debate. The parties that highlighted the Arab-Israeli conflict did not fare well.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is still likely to lead the next government – the formation of coalition cabinets normally takes weeks in Israel – but the election has weakened him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yair Lapid, the leader of Yesh Atid, now has momentum and will probably obtain a major cabinet portfolio. He campaigned mainly on domestic issues, especially those that appeal to the concentrated (and largely secular) population in and around Tel Aviv, who are well aware that a shortage of public services and new infrastructure in their region correlates with government spending on settlements in the West Bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new government can be expected to be less beholden to ultra-Orthodox groups and to hardline nationalists than Mr. Netanyahu's previous governments. In particular, Mr. Lapid has a fair-minded plan for phasing out the exemption of ultra-Orthodox young men from military service – which has long been a sore point in Israel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospects for an accommodation with <span class="companylink">the Palestinian Authority</span> are still faint. The Palestinians self-defeatingly continue to demand preconditions for negotiations; an agenda with topics for discussion would certainly be desirable, but not premature decisions and conclusions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift, however, to practical domestic issues holds promise for eventual compromise on the wider regional conflict. If Israeli cabinets cease to depend on de facto vetoes held by the most intransigent factions – and if the PA comes to its senses – there is serious hope for an accommodation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathryn Bigelow is the woman in the hot seat. The American director of the notorious new movie Zero Dark Thirty is being hammered on all sides by politicians, outraged journalists and human-rights activists for its torture scenes. They say the film is morally bankrupt because it “normalizes” torture, instead of condemning it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arguments against the movie go like this: Torture never works. And even if it did, “it could never be justified because it is immoral,” journalist Steve Coll wrote in The New York Review of Books. Like the Holocaust, said popular philosopher Slavoj Zizekalso, torture is quite simply a crime against humanity. Globe and Mail reviewer Liam Lacey had his doubts, too. “While the film may not glorify or endorse torture, it exercises a poetic licence that, unwittingly or not, can serve as propaganda for torture apologists.” U.S. senators warned that the film's flaws have “the potential to shape American public opinion in a disturbing and misleading manner.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when I went to see the film, I was expecting the worst kind of gut-wrenching brutality. But what I saw, please forgive me, wasn't all that bad. It doesn't touch the extreme violence of your average Quentin Tarantino movie or much of the pornographic violence that spews from Hollywood. The lengthy interrogation scenes show slaps, punches, sleep deprivation, food deprivation, waterboarding, sexual humiliation (nakedness) and being locked up inside a small box. All of this is pretty close to the facts, according to those who know. It's what was known as “enhanced interrogation,” although a better name would be “torture lite.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bigelow says depicting torture is not the same as endorsing it. In the film, some people give up information under torture, and others don't. Her own view of the story is that the torture, or enhanced interrogation or whatever you want to call it, was not the key to finding Osama bin Laden. But it was “a part of the story we couldn't ignore.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it did yield some valuable information – including a clue to the location of bin Laden's safe house in Pakistan. Former CIA head Michael Hayden has called this information critical. After some of the <span class="companylink">CIA</span>'s interrogation techniques became politically unacceptable, he scaled back the program. But that, too, had consequences. At a Washington forum convened to discuss the movie this week, Mr. Hayden said people can stop worrying about the treatment of future detainees because it's not worth capturing them any more. “We have made it so legally difficult and so politically dangerous to capture that it seems … the best option is to take the terrorist off the battlefield.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brilliance of this movie is that it isn't black and white – just many shades of grey. So, too, is the moral complexity of fighting terrorism. Are there acceptable ways to interrogate bad guys? Is torture ever ethical? And what's torture, anyway? Is it 10 seconds of waterboarding (the limit mandated by the <span class="companylink">CIA</span> before it was banned)? Is it taking a guy's pants off? And is it possible for honest people to disagree about the answers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I suspect the general public is not as horrified by these questions as the movie's critics are. Most people with the slightest sense of history know the world isn't always a pleasant place. Not all fights are waged by the rule of law or in the light of day, and not all civil liberties are respected. Good people sometimes do bad things in the shadows. Perhaps the ends do justify the means sometimes. We can only hope and pray that wise people are making those decisions, and that most of them work out in ways that will let them sleep at night. Thank God we don't have to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, the idea that the next government will be more attentive to human rights than the last one is generally a delusion. Barack Obama slammed the door on enhanced interrogation and vowed to shut down Guantanamo (although he hasn't). But now he's waging drone wars in half a dozen countries, delivering death from the sky to hundreds of people, not all of whom are bad guys. Is there a moral case for drones, or are they a crime against humanity? You could argue about that, too.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flu has been nasty this year, but not nearly as nasty as the battles being fought over this question: Should vaccination of health-care workers be mandatory?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of health workers have been sent home in recent weeks for refusing the flu shot. In British Columbia, the government backed away (at least temporarily) from legislation making the vaccine mandatory for all health workers after nurses waged a fierce public battle. In Ontario, the health minister, fearing a backlash, quietly refused to implement a call by Public Health Ontario to make flu shots a condition of employment for health workers. And across the country nurses have been pitted against nurses in public spats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's be clear about one thing: It is perfectly reasonable to expect all health workers – from surgeons through hospital cleaners – to be vaccinated against influenza, to make it a condition of employment even.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is no different than expecting them to wear gloves, dress in scrubs, wear masks (in some situations), wash their hands, and get hepatitis B vaccinations. These are all measures designed to protect patients from harm and, to a lesser extent, to protect employees themselves. Let's not forget that patients who are hospitalized or need community health-care services are, by definition, at higher risk of infection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ethically and legally, the safety of patients trumps the civil rights of workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Case closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That being said, introducing legislation to make influenza vaccination mandatory is a lazy and heavy-handed way of achieving a desirable public-health goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you can't convince the vast majority of health workers to get a flu shot, then how can you expect the public to do so? In public health, communication and education are – and should be – much more effective tools than coercion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada, vaccination rates for health-care workers are abysmal, in the 40- to- 60-per-cent range. But the overall figures don't tell the whole story. In hospitals, there are wards where 100 per cent of workers get the flu shot, and others where virtually none do. Rates also vary a lot by profession. U.S. data show 88 per cent of pharmacists are vaccinated, followed by doctors at 84 per cent, and nurses at 82 per cent. Then rates drop sharply, below 50 per cent, among nursing aides and assistants. The data should remind us that fear of vaccines is sometimes (though not always) related to level of education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why were nurses in B.C. – a highly educated group – so fiercely opposed to the flu vaccine? Well, first of all, they were not opposed per se. While fighting the mandatory vaccine edict, the B.C. Nurses Union repeatedly told its members to get the shot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This fight was really about respect. Nurses – and many other frontline health workers – have been kicked around a lot in recent years with measures like wage freezes or rollbacks, mandatory overtime, loss of bargaining rights and so on. They are frustrated and they are pushing back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But refusing the flu shot is the wrong hill to die on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most unfortunate aspect is that when respected health workers like nurses refuse the flu vaccine, it sends the wrong message to the public and creates an opportunity for anti-vaxers and quacks to exploit the situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fundamental issue is a fairly narrow legal one: Is making the flu shot a condition of employment something that has to be bargained for, or can it be imposed unilaterally as a measure to protect patients? It is already established practice that flu shots are mandatory during institutional flu outbreaks in hospitals and nursing homes; the question now is whether that rule is generalizable to the whole health system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet this discussion got derailed by technical and emotional arguments about the efficacy of the flu shot. Canadian research shows this year's shot works about half the time. Ideally, we would like a better vaccine, but its efficacy is irrelevant to this debate; workers (and their unions) cannot pick and choose when health and safety measures apply. To take an everyday example, hospital cafeteria workers cannot refuse to wear a hair net if research shows hair falls into food only half the time. If anything, the 50-50 record of the flu shot makes it all the more essential that health workers get vaccinated, to reduce patients' exposure to the virus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much was also made of the right to opt out of the shot, for medical and religious reasons. Again, this issue is so trivial as to be largely irrelevant. Very few people have allergies to flu shots and very few religions discourage vaccination. Scientific ignorance and vague concerns do not justify exemptions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Harper government is so obsessed with stressing what it's not going to do in Mali – combat – that it fumbles whenever it talks about what it will do.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's been a pattern of miscommunication: Let every smidge of information about Canadian involvement dribble out elsewhere, preferably on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> or overseas. Then deny it. Wait. Then confirm it. Keep everyone guessing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is that the government is sending not the message it intends, but the opposite: that Canada's being dragged in little by little.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not really true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Harper's government has avoided deep involvement in Mali. He set limits: no combat. What he hasn't set out is a clear idea of what the Canadian role should be. His government has hesitated and delayed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The message was bobbled in ways ranging from odd to surreal. News that Canada would send a C-17 cargo plane came first from a Malian <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> feed. And after International Co-operation Minister Julian Fantino personally announced humanitarian aid, at a conference in Addis Ababa on Tuesday, his spokeswoman denied any announcement was made. Then she later confirmed it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It all dates to December, when Defence Minister Peter MacKay said the military was considering what assistance, like training, it might offer to an African mission for Mali, but the Foreign Affairs Department contradicted him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After France sent troops Jan. 10, things changed. France asked Canada for transport help. One Sunday night, Mali's President, Dioncounda Traoré, via <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, revealed Canada was sending a C-17. No, the government insisted late that night, Canada's “position hasn't changed.” France hasn't made a formal request. The next morning, Ottawa announced the plane was going, but only for a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turns out it's harder to respond to global events on your schedule in the <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> age. But the government wasn't forthright, either. When France's President François Hollande called Mr. Harper two days later, the PMO summary of the call didn't mention that Mr. Hollande personally asked him to extend the C-17's tour and send more planes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there was more hesitating in announcing the extension for the C-17 until the full week was up. The government repeated: no combat troops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why leaks that special forces were guarding Canada's embassy in Bamako made news, even if it was just prudent. The government says little about special forces, and real security concerns do matter. But what the government said after the leak – steps were taken to protect diplomats – could have been said earlier to forestall the notion of secret ops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even basic questions about Canada's past training for Mali's soldiers, in 2011 and 2012, little noticed at the time, meet a wall. The Globe asked Friday how many Canadian soldiers went, and when, but still, no answers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lest one conclude there's something to hide, consider the bumbling when there's something to announce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, as representatives from around the world met in Addis Ababa to pledge funds for an African force for Mali, the <span class="companylink">African Union</span> tweeted a roll of pledges. There was no mention of Canada's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Fantino had spoken at the conference and announced $13-million in humanitarian aid, on camera. When the CBC asked about it, citing his own words, Mr. Fantino's spokesman said Canada hadn't announced anything. It didn't happen. Until press releases followed to say it did. Governments typically trumpet aid announcements, rather than playing hide-and-seek.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, at a conference to fund African troops, Ottawa hadn't yet decided what to do on that score. Mr. Fantino said Wednesday the government didn't want to make a hasty decision, which makes you wonder why half the countries on the planet were ready to make a pledge, but not Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Communications fumbles aren't much next to fighting in Mali. But the wobbly performance raises the prospect Ottawa will back away from things it can do, like training, so no one doubts the Harper government means it when it rules out combat. Gee, how could anyone get the idea it isn't being clear?</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Blankenhorn was an important person in the fight against gay marriage. When the State of California fought to ban gay marriage, he was the sole expert called to support the state's case that gay marriage would have 23 harmful consequences on society, especially on the institution of marriage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Blankenhorn has changed his mind. He no longer sees gay marriage as a threat to marriage. Far from it. He sees it as a hope for saving marriage from widespread abandonment in what he calls “middle America.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gay marriage just became a conservative cause in the United States. Mr. Blankenhorn is the president of a group with a patriotic-sounding name, the <span class="companylink">Institute for American Values</span>. (It supports fatherhood and opposes people having children outside of marriage.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute is spearheading what Mr. Blankenhorn hopes will be a coalition of supporters across the political spectrum who believe in marriage, heterosexual or gay. On Wednesday, it published a “Call for a New Conversation on Marriage,” signed by 74 “American leaders,” including the academic and author Francis Fukuyama, and Canada's own Michael Ignatieff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are no signs, Mr. Blankenhorn says, that fighting gay marriage has made marriage stronger. In the United States, 44 per cent of children born to women who have a high-school diploma but no four-year college degree were born outside marriage. “Marriage is fracturing in America,” says the call for a new conversation. It's still strong among “college-educated elites,” but “much larger numbers of Americans, particularly in middle- and working-class America, are abandoning the institution entirely.” This hurts children and contributes to the growth of inequality, the institute says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blankenhorn didn't get very far in a California district court on the 23 harmful consequences. “Suffice it to say that he provided no credible evidence to support any of the claimed adverse effects proponents promised to demonstrate,” Justice Vaughn Walker wrote in 2010, in a case now headed for the <span class="companylink">United States Supreme Court</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To his credit, Mr. Blankenhorn examined the evidence and decided that gay marriage fits with American values. It is a brave step that portends wider change.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a season that at times seems upside down, it seemed only appropriate that the most interesting players Wednesday night were not even on the ice.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was – or perhaps was not, is more accurate – Jason Spezza, the <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span>' most gifted forward, out with an “upper body” injury and, according to social media, sighted in the Ottawa airport, Toronto and parts unknown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was Sergei Gonchar, the Senators' most dependable defenceman, suddenly scratched because of some unnamed “lower body” injury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upper body, lower body, out of body – not a good sign for a team that relies heavily on both players. But not this night, not when the Senators coasted to an easy 5-1 victory over the <span class="companylink">Montreal Canadiens</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Montreal, missing was the player most talked to, and who did by far the most talking, this day in Ottawa: newly signed holdout defenceman P.K. Subban. Also missing, though sitting on the bench as backup, was goaltender Carey Price, a significant reason for Montreal's predictor-dumbfounding 4-1-0 start to the shrunken season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadiens took the early lead, scoring a weak goal on early-season star Craig Anderson. Andrei Markov – who came into the game with three game-winning goals in only five matches – walked in from the point on a Montreal power play, got the puck into the crease area and Tomas Plekanec swept it past a slipping Anderson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was Anderson's only weak moment of another solid night for him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One bad goal at one end deserves another bad goal at the other, surely. Ottawa tied the game at one apiece when Erik Karlsson's point shot bounced high off Montreal goaltender Peter Budaj, and Jim O'Brien took a swing that would be a mulligan in golf and the puck trickled in off the tee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seemed like two tired teams – both had played the night before – playing a tired game until almost the halfway point. Ottawa head coach Paul MacLean juggled his lines, sat his stars periodically and, eventually, the message got through: Wake up!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Daniel Alfredsson scored his first of the season on a power play when he jumped on a rebound and rifled it into the near side past Budaj.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less than two minutes later, 19-year-old Mika Zibanejad – the surprise first star of Ottawa's Tuesday win over the <span class="companylink">Washington Capitals</span> – scored his first <span class="companylink">NHL</span> goal on a hard slap shot from the top of the left circle that clipped in under Budaj's crossbar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one had anticipated such a showing by the Senators' minor-league prospect, but he may not be returned to the AHL's Binghamton Senators for some time at this pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When you get to be the first star,” MacLean said, “you usually get to play again.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senators moved to 4-1, and put this match well out of reach when moments later defenceman Chris Phillips put a hard blast through multiple legs that Budaj could not possibly have seen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa's feisty Chris Neil finished off the scoring on a wraparound that was poorly played by Budaj, who will surely now return to his customary place on the Montreal bench.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sideshow to this game was Subban, the reluctant defenceman who finally signed Monday for $5.75-million (U.S.) over two years. He skated virtually alone in the morning and hammed it up for every one of the many cameras turned on him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Ottawa's Kyle Turris was right Wednesday morning, when he said: “Confidence is 99 per cent of this game,” Subban has but a 1-per-cent concern in getting back to <span class="companylink">NHL</span> action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His exuberance and cockiness apparently rub some of his teammates the wrong way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I missed everything,” Subban told the gathered media in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I missed my teammates, missed the game, missed the jersey, missed the fans. This is hockey. This is what I've grown up doing my whole life and I look forward to getting back.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked if he had amends to make to his teammates, many of whom seemed cool to news of his signing, Subban insisted there would be no problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When you come back in the dressing room, it's a team concept. It's about everyone in the room. It's not about one individual or another guy's opinion. It's about everybody coming together as a team,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The quicker we can put this stuff behind us the better it's going to be for our team and our hockey club. It's not about me any more – it's about the team.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not having played for nearly 11 months, Subban was asked how long it would take him to be ready, given that he has skated and practised regularly throughout the fall and early winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's that edge,” he said, “getting back in the game. It's not how hard you practice.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pressed to guess how soon he might be back in the Canadiens lineup, the flamboyant 23-year-old defenceman could only smile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When they need me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would be right away, young man.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Again with the kids today. First, a show the kids don't watch.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The annoyingly self-involved comedy 30 Rock (NBC, City, 8 p.m.) ends its seven-season run tonight, much the way it has survived the last few years – up against stiff competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The competition tonight is The Big Bang Theory (CBS, CTV, 8 p.m.), a ratings monster, and American Idol (Fox, CTV Two, 8 p.m.), which is still going strong. Star Tina Fey has actually pleaded with people to skip Big Bang just this once, PVR it and watch 30 Rock. Possibly its publicized finale will draw more viewers, but there have been times when the show seemed to have more Emmy nominations than viewers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why? It's always been a tad smarmy, with its knowing parodies of movies and TV, it's show-within-a-show template and, mainly, its tone – great satisfaction with its own cleverness. Eventually Fey's personality outgrew her character, Liz Lemon, and, well, 30 Rock has passed its best-before date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason it was never a true hit is young viewers didn't find it funny, the wit being on the wavelength of middle-aged people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those lost viewers might be the people in Generation Jobless (CBC, 9 p.m., on Doc Zone), which tells us that 254,000 recent graduates of Canadian universities are either unemployed or doing service jobs far from their chosen field.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The doc is well-crafted, even gripping, and yet has one of those subtle underlying themes that will irritate people of a certain age – that so-called Baby Boomers squat on jobs that could go to twentysomethings. Me, I've often heard this complaint and, frankly, I can only scoff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gist of the program is an indictment of Canada's education and job-training programs. We're told that there is a crisis, and Canada will eventually be a bankrupt country teeming with well-off retirees and unemployed youth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no doubt, based on the evidence presented, that our education system is failing to connect graduates with jobs. Further, there is no doubt that graduates are burdened by unreasonable debt in a scenario where so few well-paying jobs are available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're told that youth unemployment is 15 per cent. And as startling as that might be, it's where some viewers reply, “cry me a river.” There are countries in Europe with youth-unemployment rates near 50 per cent. And, mosey around a major city in Canada and you'll find thousands of young Irish workers who have fled a collapsed economy and yet are willing to work at what they can get here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A woman aged 29 is introduced, who says, “I expected that by the time I was an adult I'd own my own apartment and wear high heels to work.” Right now, she serves in a Japanese restaurant in Vancouver. At the end of the doc, she and her friends are seen having a nice meal, drinking wine and complaining about their lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is considerable emphasis on the problem of Canadian universities churning out graduates with no hope of landing a well-paid job. Viewers hear about graduates' expectations and “the stories these young people have been told” about the automatic route to instant middle-class success being education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Again, cry me a river. A couple of years ago, after speaking to a journalism class, I was told bluntly by a young woman that she had no realistic hope of a job, and the problem was people like me. If I'd just retire, not “squat” on my job, there would be an opening for her. It was clear she felt it her right to graduate from J-school and become the TV critic for The Globe and Mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the politest way, but feeling like a codger, I explained that I'd left another country for Canada, where I knew no one, spent years at university, freelanced while working in factories and at anything that paid while at the same time writing and writing to prove my worth. I didn't have a full-time job until I was into my 30s. She was unimpressed and still felt she deserved a top job immediately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, it is clear in the doc that things have gone terribly awry in some sectors. Ontario produces way more teachers than it needs. We meet a teacher who retired 13 years ago but still teaches, possibly denying a young person the teaching hours. But why deny an experienced, capable teacher the work he does well?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The doc makes very logical points about the looming future. The Internet as a job source? We're reminded that all the employees of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, LinkedIn and other such sites could fit into Madison Square Garden. It is also reasonable to underline, as some pundits do here, that the Canadian province-based education system means a scattershot approach to job training and youth employment. The federal government gets an earful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oddest segment cites Switzerland as a place where things function brilliantly. Teenagers are streamed out of high school into training programs, and universities are difficult to enter because the policy is to graduate only the employable. Nice. But, Switzerland? Its unique economy hardly makes it a model for Canada or any other country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sorry, but the advice “everybody copy Switzerland,” which is implied, is ridiculous. It's the kind of weird joke that might be on 30 Rock. Laugh? Cry me a river.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has long been a Field of Dreams quality to the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> expansion discussion – the notion that if you build it, they will come. It was a sentiment articulated by Paul Kelly, the former executive director of the NHL Players' Association, in front of the city council of Markham Ont., during a stormy debate Wednesday morning about the viability of a proposed $325-million arena project.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As much as the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> tried to distance itself from Kelly's assertions that a 32-team league was its ultimate end game, Kelly correctly identified the two elements the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> requires before it will even consider an expansion or relocation scenario – a modern building filled with the necessary bells and whistles to extract every possible dollar from the paying customer, and a deep-pockets' ownership group able to swallow hard when they hear what the cost of an expansion franchise in the metropolitan Toronto area will be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just because the expansion plan to Toronto isn't official yet doesn't mean it won't happen, however. <span class="companylink">NHL</span> owners are not stupid when it comes to seeing windfall profits in the making. Internally, they have long viewed a second team in Toronto as “low-hanging fruit” – easy money in their pockets, in other words. That's why there has always been something of a disconnect between what they say in public about expansion (no plans beyond considering the idea “conceptually”) and what some owners really believe (what are we waiting for!).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The serious chatter about a second team in Toronto began when Kelly was running the NHLPA (2007-09), and came in the wake of Jim Balsillie's wish to relocate the <span class="companylink">Phoenix Coyotes</span> to Hamilton. The league was so vehemently opposed to the plan that it seemed almost personal between commissioner Gary Bettman and the then co-chief executive officer of <span class="companylink">Research In Motion</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mercenary reality was far simpler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The league wanted to preserve the second team in Toronto for a possible expansion franchise, so it, not Balsillie, could reap the rewards. Balsillie stood to make a fortune overnight if he could have pulled the deal off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimates put the cost of a single, stand-alone expansion franchise in Toronto at anywhere from $450-million to $600-million (which would likely include a payoff to the <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span>, even though, officially, the league's position is it doesn't need the Leafs' approval to drop a second team in their market).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the number eventually is, it will be one price for Toronto and a second, lower price for an expansion franchise in, say, Quebec City, where the projected revenues for a new Nordiques team couldn't come close to a new team in the Greater Toronto Area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the metropolitan New York area can support three <span class="companylink">NHL</span> teams and the metropolitan Los Angeles area support two, then Toronto – and its massive, growing suburbs – can easily do the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ultimate vision for the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> is to move slowly toward a 32-team entity, which would consist of four eight-team conferences. But that isn't going to happen until some of the perennial trouble spots – Phoenix and beyond – are stabilized, which is going to take some time, perhaps as much as five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem with the proposed arena plan in Markham is what happens in the interim. Ultimately, developers could gamble and move forward without any direct assurances from the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> that they will necessarily be first in line for an expansion franchise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may well be that the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> will want the team to play downtown as a tenant in the Air Canada Centre. There is a precedent for that in the NBA, where two teams (Lakers and Clippers), plus the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s Kings, play out of the Staples Center in Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So from Markham's perspective, building a new arena is not the same thing as automatically getting the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s nod of approval when it is finally ready to grant Toronto a second team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just in case anyone hasn't been paying attention, Bettman can be stubborn when it comes to people telling him what he should do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Balsillie learned that the hard way, and every new attempt to preserve Phoenix in the Arizona desert proves it. So the caveat needs to be expressed: For Markham, it's not buyer beware necessarily, but builder beware.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, the financing plan for the $325-million project, backed by developer Rudy Bratty, survived by a thread, a 7-6 margin voted on by Markham City Council in the wee hours of Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financial plan would have Markham borrow the $325-million cost of the arena, with the private partners covering half of that. The city would then pay back its $162.5-million share through a “voluntary” levy on developers' new housing projects, parking revenue and surcharges on event tickets. But the city could be on the hook for any losses, which, absent an <span class="companylink">NHL</span> team, could be a reality taxpayers don't want to face.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As false assurances go, there's nothing like your bank telling you the house you've got your eye on is affordable.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe the mortgage you need will truly fit your budget. But you won't know for sure until you try my new measure of how balanced you are in terms of what you're saving and borrowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's called the Total Debt Service + Savings Ratio and it was introduced in a column last month on how smart management of big costs such as home buying is a better way to find money for saving than obsessing over little things like lattes (read it online at tgam.ca/DmIl).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TDSS ratio is a guide to balancing debts, saving for things like retirement and spending on essentials and luxuries. If you can keep your TDSS in the right zone, you can do it all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think of the TDSS as a riff on the Total Debt Service Ratio, which all lenders use to qualify mortgage customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Total Debt Service Ratio is a comparison of your monthly mortgage, property tax and heating costs plus other debt payments against your monthly gross household income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is but one purpose to this ratio: Determining whether you will be able to repay what you borrow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In no way does it indicate whether you'll be able to balance debt repayment, saving through registered retirement savings plans or tax-free savings accounts, and spending on non-essentials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TDSS does exactly that by adding the cost of saving to the analysis of what's affordable. Now, you're measuring all your housing and debt costs plus a monthly savings commitment of 10 per cent of your paycheque. If you can keep your TDSS in line, you're good to spend what's left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's why lenders don't automatically do this kind of number crunching: Mortgage lending is an important generator of revenues and they won't do anything to prejudice a deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tell a young couple they can't afford a home and still manage a 10-per-cent savings plan? Won't happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks could actually benefit by using the TDSS to sell their investing products, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conversation might go something along the lines of, “Here's how much of a mortgage you can afford and still contribute 10 per cent of your pay to an RRSP or TFSA. And, by the way, here are the investment options we offer.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But banks evolve the way the <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span> improve – so slowly that you doubt it's even happening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's up to you, then, to see whether you'll be able to save and carry a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get you started, we've created an online TDSS spreadsheet (download at tgam.ca/tdss). Just plug in your numbers and let the spreadsheet calculate your TDSS. Or enter your figures in the print version, shown here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What you need to get started:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Gross monthly household income: Simply divide the combined annual pre-tax salaries for you and your partner, if applicable, by 12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Your projected monthly mortgage payment: If you plan to pay biweekly, multiply your estimated payments by 26 and divide by 12 to get a monthly amount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Monthly property tax cost: Get the most recent annual property tax bill for the home you're considering, increase it by the inflation rate and then divide by 12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Heating: Find out what the monthly heating bill is for the home you're looking at, or ask your real estate agent what a typical cost is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Other monthly debt payments: Add your car loan or lease payment and whatever else is applicable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Savings: Block out an amount equal to 10 per cent of your monthly take-home pay for contributions to RRSPs, TFSAs or emergency fund savings accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some background for interpreting your numbers: Lenders may let a client's Total Debt Service Ratio go as high as 44 per cent, but 40 per cent is a common ceiling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you can keep your TDSS ratio in that same zone or lower, you're doing well. Because you've left room for savings as well as repayment of your mortgage and other debts, there's room in your finances for extras like lattes, and also for extra savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If your TDSS is in the 40- to 50-per-cent range, affording the home you're looking at will be tougher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can do it, but your ability to spend on luxuries without incurring more debt will be at least somewhat compromised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TDSS scores that are even higher suggest you need to keep building your down payment before buying a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One last thing: It's a good idea to lock in your 10-per-cent savings commitment by arranging automatic electronic transfers to a savings or investment account every time you get paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders ensure they get paid by deducting money directly from your account. Give your savings the same courtesy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FINANCIAL CALCULATOR</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre"> Calculate your Total Debt Service + Savings Ratio

 The TDSS ratio shows home buyers how well they will be able to manage the cost of owning a home, keeping up their savings and having money left over to spend.

 Fill in the blanks:

 A: Income

 Gross monthly household income

 B: Housing and Debt

 Projected monthly mortgage payments

 Monthly property tax amount

 Monthly heating

 Other monthly loan or lease payments

 Total of Section B

 C: Saving

 10 per cent of your monthly take-home pay


 Your TDSS is: (B+C)/A x 100

 Your goal:
 A TDSS ratio of 40 per cent or less means you've covered savings as well as debt repayment and will have money to spend on extras.

 Notes
 A TDSS between 40 and 50 will be tight but doable; higher than that suggests you should save a large down payment.If housing and debt costs bring you to 40 per cent without savings factored in, your finances may be off balance.Banks are fine with housing and debt costs eating up as much as 40 to 44 per cent of your gross monthly income.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alison Redford appears destined to go down in history as the premier who introduced Albertans to a fact of life most Canadians have lived with for generations: a sales tax.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It won't happen in the budget she will introduce in early March – she has said as much. Instead, it would appear the province will run another deficit – its sixth in a row – rather than make the kind of draconian cuts necessary to balance its books. But a sales tax is coming. There seems no escaping it now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's all rather hard to believe. For years, Alberta has been the economic envy of the country, awash in petro dollars that allowed a succession of premiers to avoid the hard choices their counterparts in other parts of the country have been forced to make.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When spending got truly out of hand, Ralph Klein took a cleaver to things. But then it resumed as normal, with successive governments radically expanding the size and cost of the public sector while exhausting money supplies in the province's Sustainability Fund. For more than four decades, Alberta's Progressive Conservative governments have blithely ignored the possibility that, one day, oil money might not be there to bail them out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, the moment of reckoning has arrived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Redford has been on an exhaustive media blitz to explain how it's come to pass that the province finds itself in the economic pickle it does. Some $6-billion in projected oil revenues have disappeared for the coming fiscal year. The province's sole customer, the United States, doesn't need bitumen the way it once did. Subsequently, prices have tanked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta has to find new markets for its oil – that has been clear for some time. More specifically, it needs a route to Asia, where expanding economies still require lots of energy. Asia offers Alberta an economic upside that would be worth tens of billions to the province's economy. The easiest way to get oil there would be by pipeline to the West Coast. We all know where those efforts are going – nowhere. So the province is looking at alternative avenues, such as through the north, east and even down through the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But any of those options is years away. Alberta, meantime, will get what it gets shipping its product south. And that will mean the provincial treasury will also get what it gets. Right now, Ms. Redford's government has made a commitment to funding programs, services and construction that's simply beyond its means.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking an axe to these areas is never fun, as Mr. Klein discovered. First, Albertans aren't used to it. They've become spoiled over the years, including public-sector workers whose wages are the envy of counterparts across the country. Ms. Redford has an additional problem: Nearly 100,000 people are pouring into Alberta each year to take advantage of its robust economy. (An estimated 1.3 million people are forecast to move to the province over the next 20 years.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Premier has committed to spending nearly $4-billion to build 50 new schools and 140 medical clinics and postsecondary education facilities. When you have people arriving at the rate they are, you've no choice but to build the infrastructure necessary to accommodate them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Redford does have options when it comes to asking Albertans to help pay for it all. It's lunacy to be running deficits while not having any sales tax in place to help finance all that people in the province enjoy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next month, the Premier is playing host to a summit that will focus on changing Alberta's fiscal landscape and removing the volatility inherent in an economy tied to the shifting prices of non-renewable resources. Noted Alberta economist Jack Mintz says the province needs a long-term financial plan – one that insists that expenditures not exceed economic growth, as they have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's also said he thinks it may be time for the province to look at a consumption-based sales tax such as the HST, which most of the world has moved to. It's the kind of foul-tasting medicine Ms. Redford needs to deliver to Albertans – whether they want it or not. Sooner than later, that voice you hear will be the Premier's, asking people to open wide.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What he does say is that the number of bizarre and extreme weather events is piling up as a result of climate change and that Toronto had better get ready. He points to a study, presented to the city's parks and environment committee this week, that predicts more heat waves and heavier downpours in the years ahead as the climate warms. “Our staff just told us that our climate will become untenable, that people will die as a result of the changes anthropogenically caused to our climate here in Toronto.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, that's not quite what they said. The Toronto Environment Office summarized a study by SENES Consultants. Climate changes, it says, “will continue to create different weather patterns across Toronto in the future. Some changes can be regarded as being positive – longer growing season, generally more pleasant weather and fewer city resources required for winter snow clearance. However, other changes can be regarded as being negative.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It actually predicts fewer heavy storms, but says a small number of those storms will be very intense “and produce much greater amounts of rainfall in short periods than previously seen, with clear impacts on city infrastructure (culverts and drainage management) and an increased potential for flooding.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no talk of people dying. But Mr. Perks is not making any apologies. He says 70,000 people died in a 2003 heat wave in Europe. If Toronto gets longer periods of summer heat above 40 degrees, “that's when people start to die.” If the worse-case scenarios for global warming unfold, he says, then the worldwide death toll is projected to be in the hundreds of millions. “If I have to point out that people will die in order to get their attention, then, ya, I'm going to.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Franz Hartmann, head of the Toronto Environmental Alliance, said that Toronto is facing some “very, very scary summers.” By 2040, he said, we could have more than 40 days a year with 40-degree humidex readings. The electricity grid is not ready for that, he said, “and if we're not ready, we're going to have brownouts, blackouts – people are going to die.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was all a bit much for Norm Kelly, the veteran Scarborough councillor. He is skeptical and, in the mildest sort of way, dared to say so. He probed the presenters of the climate-change report with questions about the science behind their predictions. He even had the cheek to suggest that global warming might improve the city's tree canopy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the meeting, reporters crowded around him to try to get him to admit he was a climate-change denier. “Maybe next time someone will bring forward a motion worshipping leprechauns,” said Mr. Perks, remarking on Mr. Kelly's unorthodox point of view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All he was trying to do, said the gentlemanly Mr. Kelly, was point out that the science is complex and the forecasts only educated guesses of what might happen. “We interpret the past but we imagine the future,” he said, waxing philosophical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If he is skeptical, it is over “the degree to which the climate is changing and what lies ahead.” Still, he said he took the report seriously and didn't oppose studying how Toronto should prepare for the climate of the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Somewhere between alarmism and disbelief lies a way for Toronto to think sensibly about global warming.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Technoviking is back in the news. The muscular man with the pigtail and the Thor's hammer pendant, who thrilled the world seven years ago when he showed up in a short candid video, dancing in the street, is now suing the video's maker. The man – whose real name, strangely, no one seems to know – is claiming he should share in the profits that inevitably accrue from a <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> video that has been watched 16 million times. The artist who shot the video, Matthias Fritsch, is responding to the suit (which has actually been going on for three years), in a Berlin court and has spoken to the German media about it. He is still not releasing the Technoviking's actual name, so as to protect the man's privacy (and presumably not to enrage him any more). What happens will be of interest to those who watch digital rights. It asks one big question: Who has the rights to your image? And another: How to control the Internet?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story of the Technoviking goes back to 2000, a time when the streets of Berlin looked and felt a little different. The annual Love Parade, a city-wide festival of pounding techno, was at its zenith. Tourists came from all over the world to witness its frenzy. But already the Berlin underground was sick of the Love Parade's popularity and its perceived commercialism. They created an alternative parade with an impolite name, and marched to even harder and darker music through the grey streets of the bohemian districts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A young video artist (Fritsch) is taping dancers as they follow a float near Rosenthaler Strasse. His camera is focused on a guy of startling appearance: a body-builder, obviously, with abs like a rack of steel tubes. The guy is shirtless and has some kind of military holster, perhaps for a hunting knife, strapped to his shorts. He looks very much like Thor in an action cartoon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rest you have seen: a careless guy bumps into a woman, the Norse god disciplines him. After the wrongdoer disappears from the screen, Thor raises a finger in warning, all his muscles pumped, standing like a statue of Vengeance. It is this movie-like image that has been most widely reproduced as a still.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, when the threat is cleared, the Technoviking begins to dance – a powerful, stomping dance – and the procession continues. Acolytes hand him bottles of water, which he receives with the stern tolerance of someone used to acolytes. He is a hero. We all want to be him: the Technoviking is not only a caricature of the protective warrior, but also an uninhibited hedonist. He is Odin and Dionysus at once.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fritsch posted the clip on his own site, where it went unnoticed for six years. He put it on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> in 2006 and it got picked up by porn and humour sites (including the influential 4chan). After four million views, <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> started sending Fritsch cheques – his royalty from advertising. He has continued to make an artistic name for himself by collecting and exhibiting examples of the Technoviking meme in all its iterations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, of course, has everyone else: in addition to the action figures and T-shirts , there is a painting, by one Jeremiah Palecek, of the dancer in his heroic pose, that is almost as well circulated as the original video.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a mystery of the Internet age that someone as prominent as the Technoviking could have kept his name and history a secret for so long; it could only have happened with the collusion of his adversary, Fritsch. But it's appropriate that the man has no name, as he is more god than man, more myth than person. It's also a mystery how exactly the Technoviking wants Fritsch to erase all traces of the video from the Internet. The irony of the lawsuit is that it is bringing new attention to a meme that was already dead. This is known as the Streisand effect, after an incident involving a paparazzi photo of the singer's house: a protest about control of an image paradoxically publicizes the image even more. It is unfair that the Technoviking made no money from his fame, but it's too late to undo: his image has now passed into mythology, and so belongs to all of us.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JAIPUR, INDIA -- Why is the world's largest democracy apparently doing worse than the world's largest dictatorship? Hold on to that word “apparently,” since there's precious little comfort in all the comparative indicators on the current performances of India and China. Yet anyone who cares for freedom must want this free country to do better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On growth, inflation, GDP per capita, unemployment, budget deficit, corruption – almost every indicator believed in by Davos Man – India is doing worse than China. The great catch-up predicted a few years ago has just not happened. On GDP per capita, for example, India limps along at $3,851 against China's $9,146. According to official figures for 2011, India's unemployment was more than double China's. <span class="companylink">Transparency International</span>'s index measuring the perception of corruption ranks China a poor (joint) 80th in the world, but India comes in (joint) 94th. And so it goes.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, China probably cooks its books more than India does, so discount a bit for “lies, damned lies and statistics.” But almost everyone I've talked to in more than two weeks of travelling around India basically accepts that verdict. In fact, they add to it. The rural poor, they say, are hardly better off than they were two or three decades ago. A former Supreme Court justice tells me with passionate indignation that more than 40 per cent of Indian children are malnourished – “Worse than in Africa!” he cries – and a 2005 <span class="companylink">World Bank</span> report supports that view. Some 17,000 Indian farmers committed suicide in 2010 when their crops failed. Even the most superficial, privileged traveller can't avoid seeing the shocking proximity of wealth and want, whether in the garbage-piled slums of Mumbai or the medieval-looking peasant farms off a new expressway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why? Unlike China, but like Europe, India expends a vast amount of its energy simply coping with its own incredible diversity. Charles de Gaulle once exclaimed: How can you possibly govern a country that has 246 varieties of cheese? Well, how about a country with 330 million gods? And when we say a country, a 19th-century English observer once observed that “Scotland is more like Spain than Bengal is like Punjab.” A poetic exaggeration, no doubt, but this country is a continent, an empire in itself. And like Europe, it's trying to manage this diversity in freedom. China has diversity, too, but it copes with it mainly by repression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make freedom in diversity work, you need a powerful uniting narrative. The United States has that, as we saw again in the inauguration of President Barack Obama. (Yes, it's a myth, but national myths move mountains.) Europe had such a narrative after 1945 but has lost it. India, too, had it in the first decades after independence but, like Europe, it has now lost the plot. Instead, there are multiple competing stories. Unfortunately, many of these are sectarian, regional, petty-chauvinist narratives, dividing rather than uniting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there's the “Licence Raj.” Administrative structures inherited from the British Empire have hypertrophied into nightmarish bureaucracy. Captains of Indian industry like to invest elsewhere because it takes seven or eight years to get all the permissions in India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the bureaucracy of a post-colonial state is the problem, more deregulation and economic liberalization should be the answers. In some respects, they are. They are the only ways, for example, to get to a <span class="companylink">European Union</span>-India free-trade agreement. But the free-market liberalization that was introduced in the 1990s is also part of the problem. Take the media: They now boast a sensationalist race to the bottom that makes Fox News look fair and balanced and the British tabloid The Sun look like a news bulletin for the Salvation Army. Ads take up the whole front page, and “paid news” (corporations paying for favourable news coverage) is the order of the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there's politics. Everyone tells me that business and politics in Delhi are carnally intertwined like tantric gods and goddesses. Beside the shrill name-calling, regional and religious identity politics and dynastic principle, there's the monstrous condescension to the two out of every three Indians who are still dirt poor. While some corporate and philanthropic initiatives do offer them the essential help for self-help, the politicians just throw subsidies at them for basic foodstuffs and guaranteed low-wage employment for a number of days a year – then buy their votes every election time. As in the ancient Roman formula, the plebs are offered “bread and circuses.” The circuses in this case are cricket (“an Indian game the British just happen to have invented”) and the celebrity razzmatazz of Bollywood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So is China bound to go on winning? No, because while the Indian system is a daily soap opera of small crises, the big crisis of China's self-contradictory system of Leninist capitalism is yet to come. And no, again, because India is a free country, with an amazing diversity of talent, originality and spirituality. Surely that free expression of human individuality must win out in the end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I say: Come on, India! So far as I'm concerned, you can beat England at cricket in every single test match for the next 10 years, but on one condition: you also start beating China at politics. And by politics I mean not the petty competition for power and privilege, but realizing the full potential of your people.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the defining characteristics of Millennial relationships is the degree to which they happen in print. Texting (and its laptop proxy, direct messaging) has largely replaced phone calls, and, increasingly e-mails. This has broader implications for a generation's language and communication skills, but what it often comes back to is dating, or, more specifically, hooking up: For better and worse, texting makes it all a lot easier.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a just-barely Millennial, I was caught in the shift. My first dates were arranged by phone or in person, often after a three-hour late-school-night conversation. Now, a sweetly written text, while an ideal missive when I'm bored in a lineup, is supposed to stand in for the agonizing, vulnerable, scary work of talking to someone in order to date them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of my <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> followers, @wendyrose709, e-mailed me about her relationship with a guy she has been hooking up with for a year and a half. “The magnetism between us is intense,” she wrote, although their pre-and-post sexual communication is done “solely through text messaging.” She adds “I always wonder what it would be like if texting didn't exist… Instead of sending me naughty texts, he would actually have to say hello, like a human being instead of a robot.” I asked @jessecranin why he doesn't call girls he likes – he uses a <span class="companylink">BlackBerry</span>, so he gets a girl's PIN instead of her number – and he tweeted “too awkward!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">@wendyrose709 wrote that she feels something is lost when “being nervous as hell and having to muster up the courage to talk to a girl,” is no longer integral to flirtation. (Me too.) Another <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> follower, @missemilyrack, holds out for phone calls, which “limits the options, but [I] am hoping for higher quality results.” That's what @stephaniefusco did; she tweeted “I used to be OK with texting, but the thing that set my BF apart was that he picked up the phone to ask” and “I think I got accustomed to texting and ‘hanging out' vs. dating in university. A phone call was grownup, refreshing, ballsy.” Smart guy.</p>

While both on-air products are amusing and annoying, TSN 1050 is chasing from behind on signal strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Depending on weather and altitude, TSN 1050's night-time signal can fade after sunset in peripheral areas around Southern Ontario. If you're counting on getting your game via TSN 1050 (TSN shares the broadcasts equally with The Fan 590) you may have issues around Milton, Orangeville, Barrie and Bowmanville, places that get the signal during the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TSN Radio acknowledges it's had “20 to 22” listener complaints about reception since games began on TSN Radio on Jan. 19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Honestly, it hasn't been a lot of complaints,” says Robert Gray, program director for TSN Radio. “But getting the best signal is important. Our engineers are always looking at ways to boost the signal strength in our market.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, Gray recommends Leafs fans experiencing trouble getting the TSN 1050 signal try one of the other stations on their network in Kitchener or Peterborough. “Or you can always listen live online,” Gray adds. “That's a feature we couldn't use in the past.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fan leads in key demo</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, every listener counts for TSN 1050 in its challenging quest to match or surpass The Fan 590.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BBM numbers released for the December-January ratings book show that TSN 1050 is still stuck in the range it's had since coming on air in April of 2011. That is to say, some modest gains in the male 18-34 demographic but a gaping chasm in the coveted male 25-54 demo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what will it take to move the needle for TSN 1050? “Maple Leafs play-by-play,” Gray says. “In a [portable-people-meter] system, ratings follow play-by-play. We think people will find our broadcasts of the Leafs and decide to stick around.” He points to the one TSN Maple Leafs broadcast on Jan. 19 included during the latest ratings period to show how the Leafs rights can boost TSN's ratings.</p>

And it was No.2 most-listened-to broadcast in its time slot for males 25 to 54.” With a 14.3 market share, the Toronto/Montreal game was only beaten by CHFI and was No.1 in cumulative audience in that same male 25-54 demo.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An affluent friend once said he didn't mind paying a lot in taxes because it reminded him of how well he was doing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That remark came to mind this week when Statistics Canada published a short study on Canada's top 1 per cent of income earners. Predictably, the report set off a flurry of commentary, mostly to the effect that the rich are getting richer and the poorer are getting poorer. To which the answer is yes, no and it depends, making life hell for headline writers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Statscan data from 2010 showed that the top 1 per cent accounted for 10.6 per cent of Canada's total income. That seems like a big share, and it is compared with the 7-per-cent share in the early 1980s and the 8-per-cent share in the early 1990s. But it's down from the peak of 12.1 per cent in the early 2000s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remember, we're talking about relative shares. The poor can be doing slightly better, but if the richest are doing way better, the relative gap widens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Share of total income is one measurement, but what about share of taxes paid? The tax and social transfer system is supposed to redistribute money, and it does. Those 1 per cent of earners contribute 21.2 per cent of all taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what's a “fair share”? The answer is there's no consensus answer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Say a government decided to raise taxes on the top 1 per cent. That would be a popular move among those who don't believe that the very rich pay their fair share. The surprising fact – to them – is that the amount of money raised by such a move would be small relative to total tax revenues and certainly against all the schemes that advocates of higher taxes want to finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Check out the United States, which is a much more unequal society in terms of income distribution than Canada or continental Europe. President Barack Obama's package, negotiated with Congress, raises taxes on those making more than $400,000. The amount these taxes will raise is a drop in the fiscal bucket compared with what the country needs to close its yawning fiscal gap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hard political fact remains that, to raise a lot of money through personal income taxes, a government has to start raising taxes much further down the income ladder. And it's by looking at this entire ladder, rather than at the top 1 per cent, that a clearer picture of income inequality emerges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By this standard of the entire ladder, the picture emerges of Canada becoming a somewhat more unequal society. Yes, the top 1 per cent have done better since the early 1990s, but so have the entire top fifth of income earners. Their share of national income rose from 1993 to 2008, according to a study by the Conference Board of Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top fifth took home 39 per cent of total income in 2008, compared with 35 per cent in the 1980s. This trend is partly about the nature of work that increasingly rewards those with specialized skills in high demand. The trend is also about financial speculation, globalization that shifts good-paying jobs, and government programs that don't quite blunt inequality as they did a few decades ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the most unequal countries are the emerging economic powers: China, India and Brazil. Canada's inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient, is worse than in the Scandinavian countries but close to that of Germany and Australia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada, without perhaps being conscious of the fact, spends a huge amount of time and money on equality and fairness. We slosh billions around the country in equalization payments, such that even Ontario is receiving them. We hear constantly about equality of women, race and aboriginal rights. The Constitution contains an “equality rights” section.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Income inequality doesn't get this kind of attention. Focusing on the top 1 per cent, who earn 10 per cent of income but provide 20 per cent of tax revenues, obscures as much as it reveals.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to this weekend's Super Bowl, three in 10 Americans are betting on God.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new study by the Washington-based Public Religion Research Institute found that one-third of the United States believes that God plays a role in determining which team wins. And Americans are even more certain about the players themselves: A majority believe that God rewards individual athletes who are faithful to God with good health and success.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This kind of thinking about faith and success follows a broader religious trend. Over the past 50 years, American Christians have gravitated toward spiritual explanations for why winners deserve their rewards. The default rationalizations – Good things happen to good people! Everything happens for a reason! – are no longer simply clichés. They are the theological bedrock for one of the most popular contemporary movements: the American prosperity gospel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millions of American Christians agree that faith brings health, wealth and victory. This movement, which began in the Pentecostal revivals after the Second World War, has become a commonplace theological framework for how faith works to secure God's blessings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Basically, the American prosperity gospel contends that believers must learn to speak positive words (“positive confessions”) to unleash spiritual forces that move God to act. Faithful people can know that their prayers and actions are working by their effects: a healthy body, a rising bank account, an ability to overcome life's obstacles. The pursuit of happiness is no longer simply an inalienable right – it's a divine mandate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When people say that God rewards certain teams or athletes, their opinions usually reflect a range of explanations – from “hard prosperity” to “soft prosperity” – for how people earn wins or losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hard prosperity draws a straight line from the believer's faith to their circumstances. Did a player tithe 10 per cent of his income? Did an unspoken sin block his prayers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When life doesn't go as planned, Christians learn to comb through their own histories to find the source of their problem. Atlanta televangelist Creflo Dollar, himself a former college football star, urged his 30,000-member World Changers Church International to uncover the spiritual causes of their poverty, sickness or failures. “Stop making excuses,” he said. “You are the only one hindering your progress.” When life's scoreboard looks grim, they have only themselves to blame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soft prosperity, on the other hand, loosely equates faithfulness and success, allowing for temporary setbacks on the steady march to victory. Houston televangelist Joel Osteen has made a career of encouraging people to embrace their identity as victors. His weekly TV audiences of seven million tune in to hear his message of unstoppable success: “You were born to win. You were born for greatness. You were created to be a champion in life.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the <span class="companylink">Baltimore Ravens</span> face off against the <span class="companylink">San Francisco 49ers</span> on Sunday, more and more Americans will be looking for something beyond skill or luck – that unseen divine guarantee that separates the masses from the faith-filled few. The prosperity gospel dubbed it “favour.” Said Florida televangelist Paula White: “It's that feeling that God is on your side.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since America's most-watched sport is now punctuated by midfield prayers, heaven-directed touchdown dances and a Tim Tebow-inspired bended knee (now officially trademarked), this won't be the last Sunday when the country is looking for a divine way to predict a winner.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The potential for a change in government in B.C. this spring means the industry that seeks to influence Victoria's decision-makers must adapt. Lobbyists who have for 12 years offered to open doors within the BC Liberal government are seeking to persuade clients that they can speak New Democrat.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But change is also blowing in from another direction. The Wild West days of lobbying in B.C. are coming to a close. Three years after the province set up a registry so that the public can keep tabs on their activities, lobbyists are now faced with the prospect of more regulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sheriff in this drama is registrar of lobbyists Elizabeth Denham. This week we learned her office is investigating the vice-president of the BC Liberal Party, Bill Belsey, for failing to register as a lobbyist before contacting provincial government officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Denham has a dozen similar cases under investigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The majority of lobbyists are behaving ethically,” Ms. Denham said in an interview this week. But, as in any line of work, there are the outliers who are most likely to make headlines when their efforts come to light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The perception of lobbying in B.C. is defined in part by the <span class="companylink">BC Rail</span> affair, still being untangled more than seven years after a police raid on the legislature. The case involves lobbyists who provided benefits to senior government aides in return for confidential government information related to the sale of <span class="companylink">BC Rail</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More often, the conflicts arise because the rules of engagement are not clear. Liberal insider Patrick Kinsella was accused of failing to register as a lobbyist, and then refused to co-operate with a probe into his actions. Ken Dobell, former deputy minister to the premier, was granted an absolute discharge by the courts after admitting he had breached the lobbyist rules by failing to register.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law was beefed up in 2009, but Ms. Denham says more changes are needed to restore public confidence. Many of her recommendations are so obvious it is hard to believe they are not already in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Denham thinks lobbyists should be required to tell public officeholders that they are lobbying and on whose behalf, and to ensure the information they provide is accurate. When lobbyists register their work with her office, they should declare whether they or the agency they represent has donated to the MLA or cabinet minister they are attempting to influence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She'd also like to have rules around what gifts or benefits a lobbyist can offer anyone who holds public office, and restrictions so that former cabinet ministers and other high-ranking public officeholders cannot lobby for two years after they leave office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, Ms. Denham wants a code of conduct governing the contact between lobbyists and government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What this community needs,” she said, “is to pull back the curtain and have this discussion in public.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But her report, released last week, has been met with silence from the province. Justice Minister Shirley Bond is still thinking about it. The NDP is also not leaping to any judgment, although critic Doug Routley agrees the law needs to be updated and regards many of the recommendations as common sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry isn't waiting for government to do its damage control. Adam Johnson, a principal with Earnscliffe Strategy Group – one of the marquee lobbying firms in B.C. – is leading the effort to form an industry association that would help the sector shift to more professional standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It has been a bit of a Wild West, anyone could say they are a lobbyist,” he said in an interview. The sector is more mature now, but the public tends to see the worst examples. “We have to deal with perceptions,” Mr. Johnson said. “We have to show we are open and accountable.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By next summer, he hopes there will be a B.C. chapter of the Public Affairs Association of Canada. Membership would be voluntary, but he still would like a mandatory code of conduct. Because toothless regulation isn't going to build the industry's credibility. “I don't want to be a validator for the outliers.”</p>

Even the opposition understands that, which is why they have focused their attack on Mr. Harper's secondary emphasis on “pride in being a Canadian citizen.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair claims government plans to commemorate historic events consist more of “political branding and jingoism than anything else.” It is a pretty shabby characterization of the government's wise recognition of the need to celebrate Canadian identity.</p>

Vimy Ridge was a monumental victory that came at the price of terrible sacrifices. It is one of the seminal events in Canadian history, one that fed national pride and laid the groundwork for the nation-building that followed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it is an act of “jingoism” to commemorate such events, or to mark the bicentennial of the War of 1812, then let's have more of it. These are critical opportunities to educate Canadians about their history and thereby enhance their identity. The same can be said of the decision to invest in public understanding of the importance of a historical figure like Sir John A. Macdonald, who will be commemorated in 2015 on the 200th anniversary of his birth. It is not “political branding” to recognize the dominant figure of Canadian Confederation, the 150th anniversary of which itself will be observed in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mulcair does have a point when he champions commemoration of the 1763 Royal Proclamation, a document that the Canadian Encyclopedia describes as an “Indian Magna Carta.” Said Mr. Mulcair: “If he was going to concentrate on one historical anniversary, I would suggest it be that one.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First nations issues need not have been singled out as one of Mr. Harper's list of priorities, which include not just the economy and identity, but families and crime, since they are covered in each of those major policy areas, along with other Canadians. But the Royal Proclamation is a foundational document of great importance and should feature on Mr. Harper's list.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE QUESTION</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We live in a family-oriented neighbourhood in the heart of our city. Dozens of kids ride bikes, play soccer and so on while adults chat and watch. Last summer, one of my neighbours (with three sons) told me he saw a woman walking her girlfriend on a leash. I told him he must have been fantasizing. Sure enough, a woman with long dreads and multiple piercings (I'd seen her before; she rents a basement apartment on the street) came around the corner walking her girlfriend on a leash. We've seen it many times since then, in the middle of the day. My four-year old daughter asked me why the lady was wearing a leash. I told her that she was pretending to be a dog and that the other lady was playing the owner. My daughter loves inventing her own play scenarios and easily accepted my explanation. This has been going on since last summer, so it's obviously a happy, long-term relationship. But I don't love having to explain S&amp;M role-play to my four-year old and would appreciate if the dog-walking happened after, say 9 p.m. What would you do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ANSWER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now I've officially heard it all. God, it's straight out of Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot. Next Leash Lady (like Pozzo, to his manservant-on-a-leash Lucky in Godot) will be whipping her girlfriend as she walks along, saying stuff like “Basket!” “Pipe!” and “Dance, hog!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's one idea. Ask Leash Lady if you can “pat” her girlfriend, then tousle the girlfriend's hair, scratch her behind the ears, then reach in your pocket and bring out a “treat,” like a piece of Brie on a toothpick, or some coconut shrimp, and give it to her, saying “Attagirl!” and “Good girl!” the whole time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I kid, of course. The above suggestions are “for entertainment purposes only.” When you unpack this dilemma, it's actually kind of a tough (or maybe I should say rrrruff!) one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the one hand, I understand the temptation to go up to Leash Lady and say something like: “Hey could you please, like, not do that?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I mean, I think you've handled your daughter's questions in a very elegant fashion, so far. But as time goes by, she may come to doubt what you've told her – or some older kid will tip her off. And she may resent you for that – and why should you have to go through all that because Miss Knotty Dreads likes to parade her personal kink for all to see?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But here's the thing: You can just bet – you know – Leash Lady is just dying for someone to come up to her. Parading your leashed girlfriend through a residential street is a classic case of “épater la bourgeoisie” – like when the Surrealist poet Gerard de Nerval used to promenade his pet lobster Thibault through the streets of Paris on the end of a ribbon. It's a deliberate act of nose-thumbing to your “conventional thinking” and “bourgeois, materialistic values.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Basically, I'd worry that if you approach her in any kind of confrontational fashion, what will be unleashed is not her girlfriend but a hostility-laced tirade on her sexual rights, your right to judge, interfering busybodies, etc. And public discourse is already so full of hostile exchanges, I feel. (Last fall, my wife Pam was riding her bike sans helmet and a woman in an SUV pulled up, rolled down her window and said: “Did you forget your helmet or are you just stupid?” After that encounter I came up with an all-purpose riposte: Simply drolly cock an eyebrow and say “Been a while?”)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It sounds like you feel it's a happy, consensual relationship, and there's nothing dangerous going on in that basement. So if I were you I'd just relax, and enjoy/ignore Leash Lady's exhibitionistic display. All part of the pageantry of living in the big city, right? Smile and wave and act like it's normal when she sashays past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, why not approach and try to get to know this kinky couple? Find an opportunity for a chat. Don't even mention the leash. Prediction: She'll want to talk about it (like the dad who transgendered himself into a mom in my neighbourhood: I let him bring it up first. After that the trick was getting him – or, rather, her – to talk about something, anything else).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She may turn out to be a nicer person than you may be imagining. Of course, she may not, but step one is to get to know her. Everything, including whether and what to say or do about her little “hobby,” will flow from there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, if your daughter somehow discovers the truth – well, that's no biggie, either, in the grand scheme. Just take her hand in yours, look into her eyes, and say: “Honey, it takes all kinds to make up this world.” Maybe it'll help her grow up to be ultra-tolerant and hard to surprise.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women were a driving force in the democratic uprisings in the Arab world, making it all the more disappointing that their demands for equal rights have gone largely unfulfilled. In joining in popular protests to oust dictators in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya, women were also fighting for their own freedom, a battle that if anything may have been set back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Human Rights Watch</span> deserves kudos for highlighting this issue in its World Report 2013. The wrangling over the constitution in Egypt shows a lack of commitment by the Islamist government of Mohamed Morsi to protect the rights and freedoms of women and minorities. Canada and other Western countries should not be afraid to press such governments to respect equality rights for women. “As the Islamist-dominated governments of the Arab Spring take root, perhaps no issue will better define their records than the treatment of women,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cultural traditions can coexist alongside international human rights and norms. But they should not be used as an excuse to perpetuate discrimination in all its forms, be it the restriction of female judicial appointments, sexual assaults against women in Tahrir Square, or female genital mutilation. Calling for reforms is not Islamophobic, but an acknowledgment that as cultures evolve, so too must a country's laws. This is not a Western conceit but a way to strengthen a nascent democracy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada and other Western nations continue to press for greater gender equality. The United Kingdom has introduced a bill – supported by Canada – to abolish discrimination in the succession to the throne, meaning age-old traditions are changing, and males will no longer inherit the throne ahead of older, female siblings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, Egypt's draft constitution talks about the need to “preserve the genuine character of the Egyptian family” and to balance “the duties of a woman toward her family and her work.” Such vague wording is troubling. So is the fact that Sharia will be the primary source of jurisprudence; this could negatively impact on women's rights in marriage, divorce and inheritance. Western governments should use political, diplomatic and financial channels to influence postrevolutionary governments and ensure the Arab spring includes a transformation in how women are treated.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This past little while has seen some statements from unlikely sources about the critical economic importance of dealing quickly with climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Barack Obama led off the batting with his inaugural address, calling on Americans to take the lead in developing the technologies necessary for the emerging low-carbon economy. He pointed to the drought and Hurricane Sandy as the most recent evidence that our climate is changing for the worse.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the most startling statements came from the heads of those bastions of economic orthodoxy: the <span class="companylink">World Bank</span> and the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span>. Speaking at the <span class="companylink">World Economic Forum</span> in Davos, Switzerland, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the IMF and a former finance minister in the conservative government of Nicolas Sarkozy, pointed to critical pivot points for the economic future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her final pivot: “Increasing vulnerability from resource scarcity and climate change, with the potential for major social and economic disruption: This is the real wild card in the pack.” She went on to call climate change “the greatest economic challenge of the 21st century.” This from the head of the IMF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lagarde concluded with a call for a new kind of economic growth. “So we need growth, but we also need green growth that respects environmental sustainability. Good ecology is good economics. This is one reason why getting carbon pricing right and removing fossil fuel subsidies are so important.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to a question from the audience, she said: “Unless we take action on climate change, future generations will be roasted, toasted, fried and grilled.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank, went so far as to insist that climate change be at the top of the Davos agenda, along with finance and growth, “because global warming imperils all of the development gains we have made.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He went on to say that “the world's top priority must be to get finance flowing and get prices right on all aspects of energy costs to support low-carbon growth.” Achieving a predictable price on carbon that accurately reflects real environmental costs is key to delivering emission reductions at scale. Correct energy pricing can also provide incentives for investments in energy efficiency and cleaner energy technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second immediate step is to end harmful fuel subsidies globally, which could lead to a 5-per-cent reduction in emissions by 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These statements are not from the head of Greenpeace or from David Suzuki. They come from the heads of the bulwarks of the international financial system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, the IMF has resisted straying into the realm of environment and finance, viewing it as a side issue best left to international environmental organizations. And while the <span class="companylink">World Bank</span> has invested in low-carbon futures and has been active in climate talks, the issue has not been raised to the top of its agenda. Until now.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should we forgive our heroes – celebrities, politicians, athletes – for their transgressions if they give back to their communities?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following in the footsteps of Bill Clinton, David Letterman and Tiger Woods, former seven-time Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong confessed his considerable sins to television audiences around the world last month, sparking a visceral public reaction that was largely negative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although sports fans tend to forgive their favourite athlete's transgressions, those caught cheating to win seem to have a harder time: Think of Tonya Harding or Ben Johnson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Lance Armstrong is as well known for his fight against cancer, the <span class="companylink">Livestrong Foundation</span> he founded and his herculean fundraising efforts as for his cycling achievements. If our society believes that wrongdoers can be at least partly redeemed through community service, does Lance's charitable work help salvage his legend? Or does his recent confession make it even worse because he violated public trust?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE EXPERTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Doing good by raising money for cancer research does not exonerate one from wrongdoing in sport. Pursuing excellence by cheating through doping is unfair, disrespectful and unsafe.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– Paul Melia, president and chief executive officer, Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Mistakes can't be eradicated by philanthropic excellence; redemption resides in the hearts of people. Some have already forgiven him, others never will. The goal of philanthropy should be to do what is right. If he's lucky, that might result in redemption.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE READERS</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– Zach Lepkoske</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Hearing him [admit to doping] gave me a sudden urge to rip off the yellow <span class="companylink">Livestrong</span> bracelet that I have been wearing every day since I was 12. I hope that Armstrong does everything he can to regain the trust of people like me who looked up to him in times of weakness.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– Kaylynn Purdy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While he used his fame and accomplishments toward a good cause, he did it disgracefully and dishonestly. Seeking to be portrayed as a hero, Lance destroyed the dreams and passions of many athletes who struggled to be the best they could be honestly.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– Alejandra Ortez Nino</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Giving back doesn't start with creating a foundation like <span class="companylink">Livestrong</span>.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During most of the hour we have spent talking about his work – his new album, Forever Endeavour, will be released next week – as well as his insecurities and his wife who has helped him manage them, he has been looking past me, over my shoulder, unwilling to meet my gaze. But now, for the first time, he looks directly at me. “And I want to be like a St. Bernard.” He looks away again, and then back. “Okay, I'm kind of funny looking,” he offers. “But it's like a one-of-a-kind thing,” he asserts as boldly as he can.</p>

For all his considerable Juno-award-winning talent and the acclamation from legendary singers (Elton John, Elvis Costello) who have done covers of his songs, Sexsmith has always struggled with insecurity over his looks, an issue he rarely addresses. But at 49, he is learning to take control of the issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, let's just say he's trying to. Nothing about Sexsmith is unequivocal. His thoughts are like dance partners he doesn't want to stick with for long, switching from one to the other, even if they're contradictory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His looks are almost startlingly unexpected in the context of contemporary culture, in which anyone in the public realm “has to have washboard abs and perfect teeth,” he acknowledges. He wears a checkered jacket and underneath it, a rumpled flowery shirt, the unbuttoned cuffs of which hang down over his hands. His hair is like a hat your grandmother might have clapped on her head to go to church. He doesn't like to smile, because he has bad teeth, he explains. “When my first album came out [in 1995], a journalist in the U.K. wrote something like, ‘It's a good thing he has sex in his name because he doesn't look like he is getting any.' But I was,” he offers peevishly before explaining that he indulged in groupie culture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sexsmith makes no apparent effort to comply with image expectations, yet he complains about them. “I am so obsessed with music and then there's a whole other component of the industry, where you're expected to take photos,” he says in hangdog mode. “And I feel very limited with what I can do on a video or anything like that. People put extra effort into how they look, and I just don't know how to do that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He needs to own who he is, I suggest. He brightens up a bit, and tells me that while he was making his new album, he got to know John C. Reilly, the popular American actor with a humble mug. “And I just thought, hanging out with him, that he's kind of an unusual looking guy, but he's so comfortable in his own skin, and he looks great onscreen because of the way he carries himself.” He has also watched a DVD of a recent Neil Diamond performance. “I was, like, obsessed with it,” he tells me with some enthusiasm. “He comes out, and he's this little guy, 70 or something, and he owns his Neil Diamond-ness. But he's not being ironic. He's sincere at a strange level. There is this superficial world out there, but I think there are those who don't care about it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But just as he takes this happy thought out for a spin, he dumps it for a sad one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Sometimes, I feel that I can [own my look],” he says. “And then I have a setback, and I feel all down again.” He looks down at his hands, and my gaze follows his this time. He's wringing them. Then he picks at his bitten nails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Weight issues have been a struggle since I turned 30,” he confesses. “It's an emotional thing. If I get depressed, I could eat a whole box of cereal.” He swims every day, he tells me meekly, as if admitting that he did his best on a homework assignment he has failed. “It shouldn't really matter, but for me to go on stage [when heavier] it makes it hard for me to open my eyes. If I see someone looking at me, and then whispering to someone, I think, ‘Oh, they're probably saying he let himself go.' I get all freaked out.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If his looks cause him distress, so does the reputation of being a sad sack. But that, too, he makes no effort to dislodge. “What happened with me and my early albums is that I got labelled melancholic,” he says. “A lot of my songs, especially since Cobblestone Runway, which was in 2002, have been very hopeful and spiritual. They're not sad songs, really. But nobody sees that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For his new album, produced by Mitchell Froom, he tried not to think about what it should be. But as it turns out, it features the exact kind of Sexsmith songs he wishes he weren't known for. There's a lot of bitter melancholy and regret. He had a health scare, a lump in his throat that was a benign tumour, which disappeared on its own. It made him think about his life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm more wistful, thinking about mistakes I've made and other things I could have done differently.” He has a lot of guilt about those groupie, sex-filled years of new fame, for example. He was in a common-law relationship at the time and had two young children. “I screwed it up. There was a lot of self-loathing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't until he met his current wife, Colleen Hixenbaugh, that he started to find equilibrium. They were acquaintances for about five years after meeting in 1996 in New York, where she worked as a personal assistant to singer, Rosanne Cash. They got together as a couple in 2001 and married a few years ago, he says. “I always say she needs glasses. She thinks I'm like the best-looking guy in the world,” he says, bemused.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new album won't do much to displace the melancholic rap, I point out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Probably not,” he sighs. Then again, that sort of helps with the looks issue. He nods that St. Bernard head of his. “Ultimately, I look like the guy who sings these songs.” And with that, he allows a corner of his lip to lift in an attempt at rueful contentedness.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's leave aside the whole debate about whether/why/when Phil Kessel will be traded. Fact is, there is nobody on the <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span> good enough to be untouchable. There's just varying degrees of availability.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And say this for Phil The Nil, still goalless after all these games: at least he plays like a guy who cares. Seriously, regardless of how much of a skeptic you are, it's tough not to feel for him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday night was more of the same: seven shots, lots of diligence, a quick wrist-shot that turns into an assist on a James van Riemsdyk goal – and another wrist shot that rings off the post so loudly it echoes around the Air Canada Centre, followed in the second period by a puck that flutters over Michal Neuvirth that Kessel swipes at once, twice – the second time as he's falling down – without getting any joy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just like the first period, when he was all alone to Neuvirth's right, only to have the <span class="companylink">Washington Capitals</span> goaltender coolly drop to his knees. No goal. No rebound … nada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later, in the third period, Kessel and van Reimsdyk have a nifty little two-on-one set up – and the pass is too far. Nikolai Kulemin? He gets his first, all right, to tie the game. Goal for Kulemin; bupkis for Kessel. Somebody asked him if he ran over a black cat recently?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don't know what I did, eh?” he said with a laugh, looking around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alexander Ovechkin, meanwhile, gets his second goal of the season after 23 mostly invisible minutes and does nothing to remove the thought that he needs a change of scenery. Yes, sometimes it really is that simple. New city, new team, new life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Leafs' 3-2 win carried an Ovie vs. Phil sub-plot. Yes, that's how far Ovechkin's game has fallen; he's no longer compared to Sidney Crosby. He's compared to goalless, colourless Kessel, playing with ham-and-eggers Joey Crabb and Jay Beagle while his head coach, Adam Oates, talks about how Ovechkin “has to improve his game … keep thinking his position … is a work in progress.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yikes. The fact it was Ovechkin's 24th goal in 28 games against the Leafs probably devalues its worth as a harbinger for Oates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in Toronto it might be time to light a candle for Kessel. Mr. Head-In-His-Hands after every line change, who on a first-period power play gestured dramatically to John-Michael Liles after Liles elected to shoot a prayer from the blueline with Kessel stationed to his left. Kessel shook his head and put his hand out as he skated away. You'll see that on a Saturday morning from The Premiership. Saturday nights? Not so much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kessel took a minor penalty for interference a minute later, ruining a 5-on-3 opportunity for the Leafs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet through it all, the line of Kessel, van Reimsdyk and Tyler Bozak was a going concern from the opening faceoff. And it was set up for Kessel again late in the game. Another 2-on-1 and a snap shot that gets speared out of the air by Neuvirth, who ends up on his butt. A one-goal lead, the Capitals with Neuvirth on the bench for the extra attacker, net wide open, the puck turned over and Kessel just over the blueline with the net wide, wide open … only to bounce the puck wide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He's playing an all-round game,” said Matt Frattin, who scored his fourth goal. “He's taking the body hard on the fore-check. He's getting opportunities. The time you have to switch things around is when you aren't getting those opportunities.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Used to be the Burkie Cam that provided mirth and merriment at the Air Canada Centre; a staple of any Leafs telecast that honed in on since-deposed general manager Brian Burke to capture his reaction to another Leafs calamity. Might be time to get the Kessel Cam set up. Honestly, it's enough to make you want to cheer for the guy, not trade him. Kessel needs a goal in the worst way. Any way. And who's coming to town on Saturday? The <span class="companylink">Boston Bruins</span> and Tyler Seguin and Dougie Hamilton; the price the Leafs paid for Kessel. Talk about a setup.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stevie Nicks, that five-foot-one-inch rock goddess in a floppy hat, one-time lover of cocaine, tranquilizers, Lindsey Buckingham, Don Henley and Mick Fleetwood, a woman who doesn't just live in California but embodies that state with every fibre of her tiny, glittering, ragged-voiced, flat-ironed blond being, once said that “to be in Fleetwood Mac is to live in a soap opera.” And so it proved to be.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She went on to add, in a much more recent interview, that 2013 would be “the Year of Fleetwood Mac.” Here, again she was correct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While classic-rock reunions come and go – a tedious conveyor belt of pot-bellied boomers in pleather pants desperately cashing in on youthful glory – this year's much-anticipated reunion of Fleetwood Mac could not have been better timed. It's been three and a half decades since the band members overcame their toxic web of mutual heartbreak, divorce and addiction, crammed themselves into a sweaty studio, and emerged with Rumours, quite possibly the most uplifting collection of breakup songs ever written. Just rereleased as a digitally remastered box set, the album, which produced four Top 10 U.S. singles, is the eighth-highest-selling album of all time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the new release, the band is preparing for its most ambitious North American tour since the eighties. It won't be a full reunion – Christine McVie, ex-wife of bassist John McVie (whose name accounts for the “Mac” in Fleetwood Mac) and one of the band's best songwriters, will not be taking part, having long ago scooped up her royalties and permanently retired to the English countryside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that isn't stopping the waves of adulation pouring forth from both sides of the pond for what is arguably the greatest British-American rock 'n' roll fusion of all time – and the most drama-prone. In the band's most famous incarnation, it was composed of two established couples: Stevie Nicks and her long-time partner, guitarist Buckingham; and the McVies; plus Mick Fleetwood on drums. By the time the Rumours tour was finished, Nicks had thrown over Buckingham, first for Henley (of the Eagles), and later for Buckingham's best friend, Mick Fleetwood. The McVies divorced after Christine's torrid affair with the band's lighting director. Add soap, coruscating harmonies and guitar flourishes, and lather vigorously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Rumours is more than a big ol' melodrama. It's also the record that defined the baby-boomer generation. More than anything by the Beatles. More than anything by the Rolling Stones. It is that rarest of pop-cultural artifacts: a work of art in conversation with itself – a shifting dialogue of angry kiss-offs (Go Your Own Way, The Chain), sexual boasts (You Make Loving Fun) and earnest laments (Songbird) that sum up the emotional condition of a generation learning to live according to an individualistic ethic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To put the album in context: The cultural shift we've come to call the generation gap was actually the popular emergence of the Freudian notion that self-discovery was the key to personal fulfilment. Fleetwood Mac's original audience was the first generation to believe and act, en masse, as though it was their job to live not according to the circumscribed roles bestowed upon them at birth, but in keeping with Shakespeare's maxim: “To thine own self be true.” Rumours, which came out in 1977, long after the dust from the sixties had settled, was essentially a pop paean to this new way of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The album was (and still is) the unofficial soundtrack of the culture of divorce – a string of easy-listening theme songs for a generation unchained from social expectation. Back in the seventies, the invention of the Pill, combined with the rise of feminism, dovetailed neatly with this new ethos, and a generation of women and men who once might have stayed in stifling marriages suddenly saw a practical way out. Fleetwood Mac, along with Erica Jong, Marilyn French, Sonny &amp; Cher and ABBA, provided the common pop wisdom at the time. And the wisdom was simple: If you're not happy, get the hell out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For better or for worse, it's a relationship mantra most of us live by today. Since the release of Rumours, we have come to see divorce as a disruptive but necessary liberation – something to be endured, overcome and succeeded at in the all-consuming quest to live a fully self-actualized life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the ideas in Rumours remain culturally pertinent, it's the catchy tunes, breezy rhythms, genius guitar lines and lush harmonies that truly explain its ability to endure the test of time. Go into any hipster dive bar in Brooklyn, Parkdale or Hackney, and you are likely to hear it being played, alongside such contemporary inheritors of its sound as Haim, Bon Iver and Fleet Foxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The irony, of course, is that when Rumours was released, it was roundly rejected by the counterculture hipsters of the time – punk-rock fans – who saw it for the earnest collection of accessible soft-rock hits that it is. Could anyone have foreseen its eventual success as a generation-defining work of pop art? Certainly not the five baby boomers who made it – they were too busy getting wasted, having affairs and getting divorced. How nice, then, to know that people do sometimes get back together, even if it is only to cash in on their youthful glory.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the morning of Jan. 5, workers with a fleet of heavy equipment mounted a stealth assault on a bald eagle's nest near the shore of Lake Erie. Their mission was to remove the nest – one of only a few dozen bald eagle nests in Southern Ontario – to make way for an access road to the site of a new industrial wind turbine. As a pair of eagles looked on from a nearby tree, the workers sawed off the limb with the giant nest and took it away to parts unknown.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario's environmental regulations would usually make this illegal. But the wind company, <span class="companylink">NextEra Energy</span>, one of the biggest operators in the province, had obtained special dispensation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wind power is supposed to be environmentally friendly. But a lot of environmentalists don't think so. “People couldn't believe it happened,” says Scott Petrie, a waterfowl ecologist and executive director of Long Point Waterfowl, a conservation group. “Cutting down bald eagle nests flies in the face of anything you would call green energy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wind turbines have invaded many of Ontario's most scenic and ecologically rich areas. They're invading coastal wetlands and spreading along major migratory flyways – up the Bruce Peninsula, west to Lake Huron, south to Lake Erie, and east to Prince Edward County, where environmental groups are fighting a major wind development in Ostrander Point, an important bird area. “We have no idea whatsoever of the cumulative impact of these things,” says Dr. Petrie. Turbines chew up birds and other flying things, and they disrupt wildlife habitats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, in Ontario, nothing is allowed to trump Big Wind. Ontario's Green Energy Act, the brainchild of outgoing Premier Dalton McGuinty, gave the green light to rampant wind development. By 2016, the goal is to more than double the amount of wind power being generated now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wind companies are not owned and operated by idealistic entrepreneurs. They are run by some of Canada's, and the world's, biggest corporations, including pipeline and pulp and paper companies. Wind contracts are flipped like other financial instruments. Next-Era, the outfit that cut down the eagle's nest, is the largest generator of wind and solar power in North America. Because of a lucrative U.S. tax break for wind power, the company has paid no U.S. corporate income tax for several years, despite billions in profits. Big Wind is among the biggest lobbyists in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dalton McGuinty's Green Energy Act was a spectacular policy blunder, based on a string of faulty premises: that coal emissions were killing us (they weren't), that we'd soon be running out of fossil fuel (we aren't, and Ontario doesn't use much anyway), and that switching to green energy would help save the planet (not in our lifetime). As the price of fossil fuels went up and up, the reasoning went, renewables would become more and more competitive. Just one problem: The price of fossil fuels has plummeted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In order to promote green energy, governments around the world have handed out billions in the form of subsidies and fixed long-term contracts. A very generous Ontario became an international magnet for wind and solar companies. The money was guaranteed, and the approval process was easy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the wind power generated in Ontario is both expensive and useless. The province actually pays hundreds of millions of dollars to other jurisdictions to take surplus power off its hands. Energy-intensive companies are leaving because their hydro bills are too high. And taxpayers are stuck with 20-year contracts that will add billions to their hydro bills (and/or the provincial deficit). For the record, Ontario's incoming premier, Kathleen Wynne, is a big fan of these arrangements. But even a saner government wouldn't be able to undo them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, the wind juggernaut rolls on. “It's ripping communities apart,” says Heather Sprott, whose family owns a 300-acre farm near the Niagara Escarpment. Farmers in the area have been offered as much as $20,000 a year for each turbine they allow on their land, meaning they could reap $60,000 or $80,000 a year by harvesting the wind. “That's a lot of money for a farmer,” she says. But she's not tempted. She loves the views, and worries about potential health effects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Britain, the tide is turning against wind power. The U.K. has 3,000 onshore turbines, with another 6,000 in the works. Big Wind's opponents include prominent environmentalists such as James Lovelock, best known for the Gaia theory, which theorizes that the biosphere is a self-regulating entity. Mr. Lovelock is trying to stop a 20-storey wind turbine planned for his neighbourhood. In his protest letter, he writes: “We never intended a fundamentalist Green movement that rejected all energy sources other than renewable, nor did we expect the Greens to cast aside our priceless ecological heritage because of their failure to understand that the needs of the Earth are not separable from human needs. We need to take care that the spinning windmills do not become like the statues on Easter Island, monuments of a failed civilization.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every premier wants to leave a legacy, and Mr. McGuinty has left his – giant wind turbines stretching as far as the eye can see. And a pair of bald eagles searching for their lost nest.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For weeks now, we've witnessed the B.C. Liberal government ramp up its $15-million, taxpayer-funded advertising campaign.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been much discussion about one of the latest spots appearing on television – the infamous dominoes ad. In it, the Liberals contrast their record with other governments around the world. It is mostly a one-minute pat on the back for a job well done – or so the government wants you to believe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is also the most overtly partisan of the many ads that the government has been running.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The collapsing dominoes – which are actually smartphones, how hip is that? – are supposed to represent jurisdictions whose economies have fallen on hard times because of poor economic management. B.C. is still standing tall, the ad wants you to believe, because of the prudent fiscal management of the Liberals – something everyone should keep in mind come election time in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the ad doesn't come right out and say that but it doesn't need to – it's clearly implied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, pollster Angus Reid went into the field to see what kind of impact the ad was having with the public. It played the spot to 806 random British Columbians, a survey, we're told, that produces a margin of error of 3.5 per cent, 19 times out of 20. Respondents were given 10 words that could be used to portray the ad; they were asked to pick four that best described their feelings toward it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The options were: useless, deceiving, untrue, informative, fair, offensive, true, unfair, respectful, honest. So what did people think?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three descriptors that received the greatest response were all negative: Useless got 43 per cent; Deceiving, 42 per cent; Untrue, 31 per cent. Not surprisingly, those people who said they voted NDP in the last election were more likely to see the ad in a negative light. That said, even many of those who said they voted Liberal in the last trip to the polls had problems with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, 38 per cent of those 2009 Liberal voters said they felt the ad was useless, while 30 per cent saw it as deceiving and 22 per cent described it as untrue. (For the record, here is how the other words fared: informative 29 per cent, fair 24, offensive 17, true 16, unfair 15, respectful 14 and honest 11).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So is the dominoes ad backfiring?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In a certain way it is,” says Mario Canseco, vice-president of Angus Reid Public Opinion. “Because ultimately you want people to look at the record of government and establish a trust in the way it's been handling things. That certainly hasn't happened here. It's not really helping the government at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And the other thing is it's not establishing any kind of emotional connection with the one person the ad is supposed to be supporting and helping and that's Christy Clark.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pollster didn't ask whether people felt that this was the best use of taxpayers' dollars. My guess is a majority would have said no. The Liberals must intuitively know this themselves and yet persist with the ads. They obviously believe there is still more upside for them in running them than downside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a fairly cynical calculation, especially at time when the government is saying no to all sorts of groups, charitable and otherwise, as it slashes costs in a bid to present a balanced budget later this month. When you're talking about a $41-billion budget, $15-million may not seem like a lot of money. But even a fraction of it could be the difference between life and death for an organization that relies on government help for its existence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other provinces have moved to outlaw this kind of outright pandering for votes at taxpayers' expense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario, for instance, has the Government Advertising Act, which empowers the province's auditor-general to decide what constitutes a partisan ad. In this role, the auditor-general has rejected several attempts by the Liberal government to launch ads at taxpayers' expense on the grounds that they crossed the line from objective, unbiased and accurate to overtly political and self-serving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be fair, this is not a phenomenon in B.C. of which only the B.C. Liberals are responsible. During its decade in power, the NDP was just as guilty of using tax dollars to finance political ads that should have been paid for by the party itself. Even current NDP Leader Adrian Dix admits that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now he realizes how wrong that is and has vowed to enact legislation that is largely based on the Ontario law regulating government advertising. The proposed NDP law, in fact, would go even further and extend to online advertising, which the Ontario law doesn't cover. It is almost certain to become part of the NDP's election platform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For that, the NDP should be applauded. It's a law that should have been in place here a long time ago.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Someone on Stephen Harper's security detail is clearly asleep on the job. The Prime Minister was pictured on Monday morning having breakfast with a vicious, cold-blooded killer. His cat Stanley, wearing the “who, me?” expression of experienced feline deceivers everywhere, sat on a chair beside Mr. Harper, licking his chops. I thought I saw a bit of Thomas Mulcair's pant leg between Stanley's claws, but it may have been Bev Oda's. Hard to tell.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harper may have been too busy to read the major study about cats that came out this week showing that, rather than being our intermittent best friends, they're mass slaughterers of birds and rodents. Or maybe Stanley hid the paper that morning. We do know about the rest of the Prime Minister's day, because he spent all of Jan. 28 – the first day of the new parliamentary session – tweeting about it, using the hashtag #dayinthelife.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were pictures and videos from inside 24 Sussex Drive and Parliament Hill, meetings and phone calls and events that involved stacks of paper. I must admit I learned more about Mr. Harper in one day than in the previous 600 years he's been prime minister. For one thing, he owns a chinchilla named Charlie. A chinchilla that likes dirt baths, which is perhaps just Mr. Harper's way of bringing Question Period home with him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, it seems that the RCMP officers who get him to work have magical powers: They not only can speed up time, they can remove all <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> detritus from the back of a car in the blink of an eye. I hope this service will soon be available to all taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I know what some of you are thinking: A Day in the Life is a blatant attempt to humanize a politician who's often seen as authoritarian and out of touch with voters, a gambit to draw our attention away from pressing issues of climate change, economic growth, the need for arm's-length oversight of elected officials. To which I say: Yeah, you're absolutely right. And it totally worked. Any man who can maintain peace in the great Cat-Chinchilla War of 2013 is going to get my sympathy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we got, of course, was a sanitized day on Parliament Hill. It might have been nice to see another side of the Prime Minister – drawing a big red slash through any publicly commissioned scientific reports he didn't enjoy, let's say, or tearing bits of duct tape into mouth-sized pieces to use on wayward MPs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking of which, I'd personally have liked to see him visit his anti-abortion backbenchers in the padded cell where they're usually kept under the House of Commons, but I think they must have been out on a day pass. By the way, Prime Minister, I think they stole some pens on the way out. You might want to check the stationery cupboard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a particularly staid, modest – dare I say, Canadian – style of government on view. You might think, judging from Mr. Harper's pictures, that this country is powered by the twin engines of file folders and Diet Coke. I kept waiting for the vices of a stressed leader to appear – David Cameron's Fruit Ninja obsession, perhaps, or Margaret Thatcher's tumbler of Scotch or Barack Obama's sneaky smokes. Instead, we got the decadence of fruit salad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then I began to wonder what the tweet streams of other leaders, past and present, might look like, should they engage in such experiments. Would we get a glimpse of the man (or woman) behind the throne?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">François Hollande: 11 a.m. Wake up. Baguette, espresso, Tums. 11:30.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lots of big numbers – hundreds of billions of dollars – are being thrown around about future natural resource investment in Canada, with aboriginals demanding their share.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their demands are based on treaty rights and aboriginal rights, however defined, in the Constitution Act, 1982. Making the demands has been easier than negotiating them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aboriginal rights have been subject to political debate and glacial negotiations between aboriginals and governments since they landed in the Charter. In British Columbia, a process for settling disputes has sputtered for more than two decades, with many aboriginal groups refusing even to participate. Elsewhere in Canada, a huge backlog exists of unresolved claims related to signed treaties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given such little progress, aboriginals have tried to advance their cause in law. There they have found courts willing to move the yardsticks in their favour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One yardstick established by the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span> is the Crown's obligation to “consult” aboriginal groups if lands they claim are to be developed for, say, mining or roads or oil and gas development. This obligation has been, and remains, hard to define.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 1997, the Supreme Court decision in the Delgamuukw case established the obligation to consult and tried, not terribly successfully, to define what it meant. Put crudely, the court outlined a sort of sliding scale of obligations over land where aboriginals had title: the stronger the claim, the more serious the consultation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If, for example, a company wanted to run a pipeline down the main street of an aboriginal village, the aboriginals would have a veto. If, however, the pipeline would run over lands far removed from the centre of aboriginal settlement, where perhaps occasional hunting forays had occurred long ago, then the obligation to consult would be quite limited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble was, and remains, that no one can know before a claim is settled, or a treaty signed, just how credible the claim might be. Even then, a treaty signed long ago can be variously interpreted today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's obviously in the interests of aboriginals to make the most sweeping initial claims possible, whether they have much justification in history, current reality or law. As long as the claim is there, aboriginals can interpret Delgamuukw as giving them a de facto veto, even if that isn't what the ruling said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Haida case of 2004, the Supreme Court took another stab at the conundrum of defining consultation. It said governments had a “duty to consult” when “the Crown has knowledge … of the potential existence of the aboriginal right or title and contemplate conduct that might adversely affect it.” The “duty to consult” was related not to an actual claim but to the potential of one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once again, the meaning and reality of “consult” was left vague, perhaps necessarily so, since how can one define a process of consultation that would be agreed to by all parties. In practice, what “consult” means to aboriginals is “we must agree.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the consultation goalposts have moved further toward the aboriginals' conception, courtesy of a ruling by the Court of Appeal for Yukon. In a case involving the Ross River Dena Council, the court said the way the government had previously dealt with mining claims and their possible impact on aboriginal land claims was inadequate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mining companies, in what was called an “open entry system,” would prospect, stake a claim, record it with the government registry, then begin more intensive exploration, with exploration activities subject to government legislation that would then require consultation with aboriginals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not good enough, said the court. In ways yet to be determined, governments have to consult aboriginals before anything is done that might some day, somehow, have an impact on whatever land they might claim, or have claimed, even if such claims haven't been tested or resolved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aboriginals must be delighted with goalposts moving closer all the time toward their conception of consultation as approval by them of anything and everything that might occur on land over which they claim rights, proven or unproven.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By most accounts, Max Aitken didn't know a lot about art. That didn't stop the first Lord Beaverbrook from collecting it, though – by the time he died, at 85 in 1964, he'd acquired almost 2,000 paintings, drawings and artifacts – nor from having opinions about it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, the man knew what he liked. While he consulted experts from time to time, he tended to take their advice only when, as one wag observed, “it agreed with his preconceptions.” In this regard, he had a fondness for portraiture, figurative art, landscapes, narrative paintings, the plump bosom of a William Etty nude. Abstract art he hated, calling it “intolerable” and “nonsense,” and predicting “it will die.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Born in Ontario, raised in New Brunswick (a province for which he retained a lifelong affection), he was the son of a Presbyterian minister who, upon immigrating to the U.K. in 1910, rose to prominence as a politician, press baron and Winston Churchill confidant. But Beaverbrook also had what one of his biographers called “a hard-nose sense of value.” Translation: He was cheap. Yet amazingly, for all the apparent philistinism and penny-pinching, his lordship pulled together a pretty fine potpourri of pictures, much of which, starting in 1959, he installed in the Fredericton gallery that bears his name to this day. Indeed, there's general agreement the Beaverbrook Art Gallery's permanent collection is the most significant and valuable of any art institution in Atlantic Canada. It's certainly the most eclectic: What other city of 55,000 can boast of having works by Botticelli, Augustus John, Tom Thomson and Salvador Dali under one roof?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the gallery is putting what chief curator and newly named director Terry Graff calls “the crème de la crème of that collection,” 75 works in total, on the road for the next three years, beginning with the current two-month exhibition at the Society of the Four Arts in Palm Beach, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Called Masterworks from the Beaverbrook Art Gallery, the exhibition so far is booked into six cities (two U.S., four Canadian), with more to be announced. While the Beaverbrook has lent many of its holdings to exhibitions around the world – in 2010, more than 250,000 visitors scanned its famous Dali canvas, Santiago El Grande , at the High Museum in Atlanta, Ga. – Masterworks represents the first-ever large-scale marshalling of its most illustrious objets for an international and national tour, accompanied by the publication of a hardcover coffee-table book from the gallery and Fredericton's Goose Lane Editions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Included in the show are such distinguished works as the aforementioned Santiago El Grande, along with The Fountain of Indolence (1834) by J.M.W. Turner, Lucian Freud's Hotel Bedroom (1954), A Passing Storm (1876) by James Tissot and Lucas Cranach the Elder's Lucretia (1530), plus several strong Canadian paintings. Most notable among these is the vivid winter scene Merrymaking (1860), perhaps the finest extant Cornelius Krieghoff canvas, which the normally tight-fisted Beaverbrook bought for $25,000 in 1957, at that time the most ever paid for a Canadian artwork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's safe to say that a decade or so ago the Beaverbrook Art Gallery's collection, based in a rather out-of-the-way city, was more known about than known, certainly in the rest of Canada and internationally. This all started to change in 2004 when the gallery became entangled in a much-publicized and expensive dispute with its long-time benefactors, the Beaverbrook U.K. and Canadian foundations, over who ultimately owned 211 works in the permanent collection. As the case dragged on (the dispute with the U.K. group wasn't settled until 2010; the one with the Canadian side, involving 78 works, 11 of which are included in the Masterworks tour, remains unresolved) and media attention intensified, images of the art in question began to circulate widely and gain familiarity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ironically, when Bernard Riordon, former director of the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, was hired as the Beaverbrook gallery director in 2002, it was on the understanding, in part, with the foundations that he would help turn the collection into a touring, revenue-generating asset while raising the gallery's profile and attendance as a cultural destination. (In 2011, the Beaverbrook's visitors totalled 24,000.) Although it's true the disputes have sucked up millions of dollars in legal fees, “they've had some pluses in terms of drawing attention to what we have,” Graff said recently. “You couldn't buy the marketing and promotion we had for the collection.” All of which made the “Masterworks” concept an easier sell to both North American galleries and sponsors when it was pitched. Observed Graff: “It's opening up a lot of relationships.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masterworks from the Beaverbrook Art Gallery is at the Society of the Four Arts, Palm Beach, Fla., until Mar. 31; the Mobile Museum of Art in Mobile, Ala., from Dec. 5 through Mar. 2, 2014; the <span class="companylink">Glenbow Museum</span> in Calgary May through August, 2014; the Winnipeg Art Gallery September through December, 2014; the <span class="companylink">National Gallery of Canada</span> in Ottawa in the summer of 2015; The Rooms Provincial Art Gallery (St. John's) in the summer of 2016.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any given year, there are many more roles for men than there are for women, and that has an interesting side effect: Because there are fewer outstanding roles for actresses, fewer of them get overlooked in the Oscar race. That's not much consolation for the paucity of female characters, I know. But the list of nominated actresses almost always feels right. You might argue (as I would) that Marion Cotillard deserved a nomination for Rust and Bone, or that Judi Dench should have earned a nod for Skyfall. But you couldn't fill the actress slots over again with worthy candidates.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet you could, easily, with the spots for actors. Jean-Louis Trintignant for Amour, John Goodman for Argo or Flight, Leonardo DiCaprio for Django Unchained, James Spader for Lincoln, Javier Bardem for Skyfall, Suraj Sharma for Life of Pi (remember, he performs nearly all his scenes against a green screen, opposite no one) – any of them would belong on the Oscar list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To me, the most glaring lead-actor omission is John Hawkes. In the true story The Sessions, he plays the late Mark O'Brien, a paralyzed poet who lost his virginity to a sex surrogate (played by Helen Hunt, who earned a supporting-actress nod). Hawkes has been nominated before, for playing a meth addict, Teardrop, in 2010's Winter's Bone – opposite Jennifer Lawrence, who appears headed for a best-actress win this year for Silver Linings Playbook – and in The Sessions he delivers a performance that is equally Oscary. For those who haven't seen it, which is most of you, I fear, it's still playing in some theatres and is newly available on demand. (Hawkes also has a small but amusing role as a lobbyist in Lincoln.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because O'Brien was largely immobile, Hawkes had to perform lying down, on a foam ball that contorted his spine. Relying only on his face and voice, he injects just the right combination of wit and sadness to keep his character from becoming too angelic or maudlin. His gentleness is a nice departure from the sinewy, often scary characters he plays in films, such as the charismatic cult leader in Martha Marcy May Marlene, and from his TV work on Deadwood and Eastbound &amp; Down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Winter's Bone caught everyone's eye (in addition to the Oscar nomination, Hawkes won the Independent Spirit Award for best supporting male), “I was in the unusual position, for me, of having scripts sent to my house,” he said in an interview. “But it wasn't like the studios were clamouring to make me the It guy.” Out of that pile, The Sessions was the lowest-budget film of the bunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a leap of faith every time you do a film, and this one more so, I guess, because it's mentioned in the script that Mark hasn't seen his penis in 30 years,” Hawkes, who is 53, says with a playful smile. In person, he seems shy but game, and his big, faded blue eyes suggest a limitless inner horizon. “But there were many wonderful tools at my disposal,” including O'Brien's poetry and writing; a documentary short that had been made about him, Breathing Lessons (which won an Oscar in 1996); and the fact that the writer/director of The Sessions, Ben Lewin, was himself physically disabled due to childhood polio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was unusual to be lying immobile with a beautiful naked woman on me, but that was not a bad thing,” Hawkes continues, laughing “And as an actor who often misses his mark, it was easier, in a way, to be immobile. I was always in my spot. The DP [director of photography] was never angry with me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate interview, Lewin chuckled at Hawkes's modesty. “I have to tell you,” Lewin says, “the first time John was in character, and the people who knew Mark saw him – mainly Susan [O'Brien's widow] and Cheryl [his real sex surrogate] – it was a very freaky moment for them. I could see how deeply moved they were in a totally unexpected way. They were seeing Mark reborn. That was no mean feat.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hawkes prefers to be modest, however – it protects him from being over-hyped. “I'm happy in my life, and more nervous about being pushed down people's throats,” he says. “I can be most effective as an actor if people believe what I do onscreen, and the only way to do that is to preserve some mystery. The less of me the better, is my approach.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some details of his story – that of a true working actor – are too good not to share. Born John Perkins and raised in Minnesota, he had an “aha” moment as a high-school sophomore during a school trip to see The Crucible. “I didn't know how I would become an actor, but I knew that my life was different from that moment on,” he says. “Those people onstage had in a very powerful way moved me, and I wanted to see if I could move people also.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His first role was Pig-Pen in his school's production of You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown, a role written into the musical by his teacher, Tamara McClintock, who wanted to flesh out the chorus. (Hawkes takes care to mention by name the people who matter to him.) “The basis of my technique is what I learned in my first moments, working with her,” Hawkes says. “She taught me to meditate, all kinds of things I use to this day.” Though he only had two lines, he remembers lying in bed at night during the rehearsal period, doing the entire play, “everyone's lines, every word to every song, in order” in his head.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He spent one year at university, taking every theatre class available. A friend, Tim Streeter, “a really cool guy, a photographer and a playwright,” introduced him to the music of Tom Waits, the book On the Road and the movie Harold and Maude, and “those three things in a one-month period had my thumb out and hitchhiking thousands of miles,” Hawkes says. He ended up in Austin, Tex., where he helped form a theatre company and spent the next seven years acting in plays by the likes of Wallace Shawn and Terrence McNally. “We did an insane version of Our Town with a female stage manager, in 1984, before people were doing that,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In approaching his role in The Sessions, Hawkes was keen to mine the humour of O'Brien's situation. “Not for cheap laughs, but to find truth and absurdity and funny beauty wherever I could,” he says. “I was interested in fighting self-pity. It's boring to watch someone wallow, even if he has every right to. It's more interesting to watch someone try to solve his problem. I think art, in general, can help us shed light on things we normally look away from.” Awards contender or not, Hawkes is always worth looking at.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week Vancouver City Council approved the Vancouver Food Strategy, which will, to quote the report, improve access to healthy and affordable, culturally diverse food, enable food-friendly neighbourhoods, empower residents, and advocate for a just and sustainable food system. I don't really know what any of that means but people seem to to be celebrating it so, yay. I have a hunch I'm not the target audience here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">See, I do a lot of my shopping at this thing called a “supermarket.” Stay with me here. Try to wrap your mouth around the word. It's a combination of two words: super (meaning above or beyond) and market (a place where you buy stuff). So, like, a really good place to buy stuff.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I usually go there early on Saturday mornings. A one-dollar refundable deposit gets me the use of a large cart that I push through the store gathering what I need for the week. Bread, milk, cheese, eggs, meat, fish – that sort of thing. I can also buy a cheaply made sweater, or jeans for my children, a small appliance, and some patio furniture if I choose. They often offer me an incentive to spend more money. Some weeks it's a gift card that amounts to roughly 10 per cent of my purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other weeks it's a frozen wheel of cocktail shrimp. After paying for the items, I pack them into wicker baskets I keep in the homemade bamboo trailer behind my bike. Just kidding. The bins are plastic and I keep them in the back of the Honda. Later the same day, I may walk to Norman's for fresh produce, the Ravioli store for pasta and pizza dough, and hit the Grotto for cheese slightly more exotic than the waxy medium cheddar I picked up earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'll go out on a limb here: I think most people in the Lower Mainland probably acquire their food in a similar fashion. Grocery store for the basics, green grocer for the fresh stuff, and a couple of specialty shops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after reading the city's food strategy, it's clear that I'm doing it all wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, I'm not telling stories about food. That's something the report approved by council this week says is important: “The importance of emphasizing personal ‘food stories' was prioritized during community consultation with socio-economically diverse, age-diverse, and harder-to-reach communities. Storytelling was used as a means of engaging groups and organizations, highlighting community priorities and personal connections with food.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turns out that when the city held a food-themed storytelling night, it drew more than 400 people, according to the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I do have stories about food, but most of them aren't very interesting. They're mostly about the cashiers, to be honest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another earth-shattering revelation in the report is this: Some people who live in this city don't have enough money to buy good food or enough of it. The report puts it like this: “In spite of the food system assets that Vancouver enjoys, there are a number of gaps and vulnerabilities including unequal access to healthy, affordable food. … Added to these challenges are disturbing socio-economic trends across Canada including a growing income gap, social polarization …”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, let me see if I have this right: In a city of obnoxious wealth and abject poverty, where what's left of the middle class routinely spend 60 per cent of their income to keep a roof over their heads, there's not a pile of cash left over at the end of the month. Is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listed at the top of the Food Strategy's five priorities and goals is this: “Food Production: Increasing opportunities for urban agriculture, including community gardens and urban farms.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regular readers of this column may know that last year I embarked on a major project to grow vegetables in garden boxes beside my house. It was not a complete success, though the tomatoes that ripened in mid-November were tasty. But in an average two-week period, we discard more organic material in the form of store-bought potato peels, apple cores and banana peels than I harvested from two garden boxes in an entire growing cycle. Maybe that makes me a bad urban farmer. In fact, I'm certain I'm a terrible urban farmer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what I've learned is that the key to my family's food security does not depend on our meagre harvest or storytelling. It depends on two people working full time (and then some) to earn enough money to service the mortgage and have enough left over to buy groceries from a store that is the aesthetic opposite of a farmer's market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if we're lucky, they'll throw in a shrimp ring.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News of a study claiming cats are responsible for the deaths of 1.4 to 3.7 billion birds and 6.9 to 20.7 billion mammals annually in America sent the world's editors scrambling this week for photographs of cats looking vicious. The New York Times website took the prize by posting a picture of a beastly looking cat with an adorable-looking rabbit dangling from its mouth.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers from the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute examined local surveys and pilot studies in order to reach their rapidly disseminated conclusions, published in Nature Communications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Domestic cats are destroying the planet,” the blog i09 warned in their headline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Cats killing billions of animals in the U.S.,” wrote the BBC, reporting that Pete Marra, one of the authors of the study, claimed that cats are “the top threat to U.S. wildlife.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was the <span class="companylink">British Petroleum</span> oil spill of public-relations disasters for cats. News outlets listed their prey as a cornucopia of cuteness – squirrels, rabbits, chipmunks and songbirds were given top billing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few invasive species are killed by cats, said Dr. Marra. The small rodents they consume aren't Norway rats or mice, “but native species such as meadow voles.” Not just any vole but the meadow vole, that pastoral ambassador of goodwill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Honestly, I started to wonder if a cat had broken Dr. Marra's heart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was able to reach some cats for comment at Feral, a cat bar not far from my home. I sat on a bar stool and was immediately served a dead shrew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Oh. Thanks. Could I get a Jameson's and soda?” I said to the tabby tending the bar. He stared at me blankly before nudging the shrew a little closer to me with his paw and tilting his head to one side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A black cat jumped onto the seat next to me and laid a dead starling beside the shrew before rubbing his head against my shoulder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mood in the bar was sombre. “You look down,” the bar-tabby said to me. “Would it help if I showed you my ass?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“No. Just a drink, if you don't mind,” I tried again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“From the faucet?” he said. “We have a number of running faucets on tap.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“She doesn't want any of that,” said the black cat. “You're here about the study, aren't you?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I thought we weren't going to talk about the study, Mr. Whiskers,” said the bar-tabby. “Patrons come in here to forget.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm a journalist,” I said, if only to convince them I really needed a drink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Yeah, aren't you the one who's always bothering the monkeys? Am I shedding enough on you? You look cold,” said Mr. Whiskers as Tom, a rugged tomcat, leapt up on another bar stool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This hit us pretty hard,” said Tom. “This is not cool for cats. Look, we thought you were hungry.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You should've said something,” said Mr. Whiskers. “All I know is, when I left a meadow vole in a slipper, I'd come back and find that vole gone. Sometimes I heard a squeal of excitement.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Now we read in The New York Times that our gifts weren't welcome. One day you're carefully arranging a dead robin on the kitchen counter for the one you love, the next day you're ‘one of the greatest global anthropogenic threats to wildlife.'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You mind if I take a look in that fridge over there?” I said. “Research.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Go ahead,” said the bar-tabby. “Whatever makes you happy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Don't worry, I'll keep an eye open for anything that might trip you,” said Mr. Whiskers, jumping down from his barstool and weaving in and out between my feet as I walked to and from what turned out to be an empty fridge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I kept your seat warm!” said Tom brightly, staying firmly on my seat when I returned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Siamese came over and shyly dropped off a dead baby squirrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Would you like a hairball with that?” said bar-tabby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm good,” I said, turning to leave. “But thanks.” They purred, and I felt bad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Would you like us all to follow you home and yowl for hours on your front porch?” said Tom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'll just get a cab,” I said. “You guys are great.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All three just stared, in different directions, but as if there were something really important there. And I found myself, as had happened before, unable to do anything but to sit back down and stroke the bartender's head.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Allison won't take the bait; won't admit how sweet it must feel right about now. Instead he stumbles through a few half-completed sentences, then gives up. “I can't find the words,” he concedes.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He could be forgiven if he gloated. Only a few months ago, he thought his career at Queen's Park was over, after Dalton McGuinty's officials told him he was no longer wanted as chief of staff to a minister. Then the Premier announced he himself was done, and just as Mr. Allison was moving out his boxes, he got an invitation to manage a leadership campaign. So this week, he walked back into the legislative building alongside Mr. McGuinty's replacement, Kathleen Wynne.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Allison were inclined toward bitterness, though, he wouldn't have been able to mastermind the charm offensive that helped Ms. Wynne triumph at last weekend's Ontario Liberal leadership convention. That he was able to walk into the first meeting of her staff and volunteers, proclaim that hers would be the “friendliest” campaign, and then make good on it had much to do with professional experience to which other Liberals are able to relate, and personal struggles they're barely able to fathom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After enlisting as a junior provincial staffer in the mid-1980s, the 53-year-old worked on countless campaigns for countless Liberals. A couple of memories – running Joe Cordiano's bid in the 1996 provincial leadership that Mr. McGuinty won, and playing a senior role on Michael Ignatieff's unsuccessful 2006 federal effort – stuck in his head.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We were so determined to win at every step,” he recalls. “The problem is that if you get very competitive, your elbows get up, and you end up arriving at the convention to discover you don't have enough friends.” That meant frontrunners wound up falling to underdogs like Mr. McGuinty and Stéphane Dion, who in turn had to spend years trying (unsuccessfully, in Mr. Dion's case) to paper over rifts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there may have been another reason why Mr. Allison was able to bring a degree of maturity to Ms. Wynne's campaign for which political operatives, let alone those cast out by their own party's elites, are not typically known.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walking home from Queen's Park one day in 1994, Mr. Allison felt an unbearable pain in his chest. He walked straight into an emergency room, and learned he was suffering an aneurysm caused by Marfan Syndrome, a connective tissue disorder with which he had been diagnosed as a teenager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fourteen years, three more aneurysms and a couple of surgeries later, Mr. Allison found himself in a hospital room in Houston. He was supposed to have been the first person in Canada to undergo a procedure that involved having his entire aorta replaced with dacron; his doctor decided he was too high-risk, and shipped him south.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Allison expected to be in an induced coma for up to 10 days. Instead, it lasted 4 1/2 weeks, during which he had six separate trips to the operating room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“To be honest, if I had known what I was going to go through, I wouldn't have done it,” he says. “I lost a year of my life; I'm in pain right now.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for all of its misery, the ordeal also brought some perspective to someone who had previously gained a reputation for his prickliness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I remember visiting him in the hospital, and thinking, ‘Wow, his personality has really changed,'” recalls Tom Jakobsh, a long-time friend who worked alongside Mr. Allison on past campaigns. “He was a mellower, more thoughtful person. He was more patient. And he developed an ability to be polite and respectful to people he didn't like or respect.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Allison is characteristically circumspect, but it's obvious the carloads of Liberals who visited him in Texas affected him. “I felt so supported by my Liberal family – it was extraordinary,” he says. “I've always believed the best part about being involved in politics is the friendships. And it just reinforced that in the best possible way.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With time, after the surgery, Mr. Allison went back to being what many in his party refer to as a “hired gun.” When Mr. McGuinty vacated his job, several would-be successors thought he might run their campaigns – including Glen Murray, the minister who had unsuccessfully pushed back against the Premier's office's instructions to replace him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Allison concedes it was “extremely difficult,” even “hurtful,” to explain to Mr. Murray that he needed to go to more of a contender. “I said to Glen, it's really important for me to manage a campaign where I truly believe my candidate can win – I need that to get up every morning and go to the campaign office.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor does he pretend that he went to Ms. Wynne because of a “close personal friendship”; she was just “smart enough to want somebody who had a lot of experience.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet speaking to those who worked under him in that camp, there is an appreciation for the way he pushed back against the inclination of a governing party filling a leadership void while trailing in the polls to turn on itself. “He led by example,” says a campaign worker. “If he overheard any conversation that was negative toward other Liberals, he shut it down immediately.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maintaining that culture now that Ms. Wynne is leading the Liberals will be considerably trickier. Mr. Allison is now expected to step into the “operations” role in the Premier's office, a highly political job that previous occupants have used in part to crack down on dissent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could be him, next time, who has to decide that other staff have outlived their usefulness. But for now, he's trying to stick to his hard-learned lessons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When we had our first transition meeting, I said the same thing I said at our first campaign meeting,” he recounts. “If we are known as friendly, it will pay dividends.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Vancouver, it's been a week for eulogizing the single-screen, independent cinema experience, with the final screenings at the Ridge Theatre. The beloved Ridge has fallen victim to development – a condo will rise in its place – but there's a crisis in the independent cinema community that goes beyond land values. These theatres are in a race to convert to pricey digital projectors, with 35-mm prints in short supply – and soon to be unavailable altogether when the film industry moves entirely to digital. In the scramble to keep up, small cinemas are crowdsourcing to raise tens of thousands of dollars for the new equipment. And the stories coming out of these small-town efforts are worthy of big-screen Hollywood treatment.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In tiny Sidney, a retirement community north of Victoria, the Star Cinema has been trying since May to raise money for two digital projectors and new seats to replace the current worn-out, 30-year-old chairs. With a target of $185,000 (originally $200,000; the cost of digital projectors has fallen), they're close: The cinema has raised nearly $170,000 – most of it from patrons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's just a small theatre on a side street in a town of 11,000, but it has an incredible emotional pull for the community,” says Susan Simosko, a resident and volunteer fundraiser. “Theatres are closing everywhere and we just decided we are not going to let this little theatre close.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Originally from New York, Ms. Simosko says the little cinema represents a link to the outside world for her. She stepped in to help last spring, around the time theatre owner Sandy Oliver lost her sister – and theatre co-owner – Carolyn Lewis to ovarian cancer. Ms. Simosko has been getting up in front of audiences before screenings, asking patrons to donate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a screening of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel last summer, as soon as the credits started to roll, a woman stood up and suggested the entire audience pitch in and donate a $150 seat. They did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A teenager, in town for the summer visiting family, offered to do some fundraising – and came back with $25,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">Disney</span> editor in L.A., writing a book on the decline of the movie business, donated $500. His brother sent another $500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A local business owner dropped by last fall with a cheque. He recalled that shortly after the theatre opened in 1998, a family member took a group of children there, but, not realizing the cinema didn't take debit or credit cards, had no cash with him. The family wasn't turned away. One of the sisters told them to not to worry, to go on in and have a good time. “He has never forgotten that,” says Ms. Simosko. “Almost 15 years later and he gave a donation of $10,000.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone is on board: Some balked when the municipality included a note about the cinema's fundraising in a town mail-out. But even if it's a private business – which cannot offer a tax receipt – Ms. Oliver says the cinema performs community functions. It hosts local events, it's a meeting place for seniors, there are low-priced screenings of children's movies and it's an affordable night out – with the top ticket going for $9 and popcorn reasonably priced rather than the “break-the-bank fine dining prices” you'll find at the multiplex, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The community response has been overwhelming. The new seats are expected in March, a friend who took out a mortgage on her house to buy the first digital projector is being repaid, and with naming rights available for one of the cinema's two theatres (the other will be named after Ms. Lewis), Ms. Oliver is certain they will reach their target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other theatres have noticed; some are looking to the Sidney experience for guidance, including the Hope Cinema, which is about to embark on a fundraising effort to replace its 1950s projector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Oliver herself was inspired by the Salmar Theatres in Salmon Arm. A community-run cinema since the 1940s, the Salmar boasts that it may be the only non-profit group in North America to operate a first-run multiplex. Profits go back into the theatre or the community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A group from Nelson recently toured the Salmar; they're embarking on a big crowd-funding effort to restore their Civic Theatre, which closed nearly three years ago. Last June, residents formed a non-profit society. Their plan: split the space into three new theatres, and upgrade to digital projectors. Total cost: about $2.5-million over three years, with a first stage of $150,000 for the initial digital conversion. That campaign will kick off Feb. 23, when the theatre reopens with a screening of Skyfall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A movie theatre is more than just a movie theatre,” says Roger Ley, vice-president, Nelson Civic Theatre Society. “It's a meeting place and a place that brings people out of their houses and into the downtown core.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a happy ending, look to Powell River: When Patricia Theatre co-owner and operator Ann Nelson learned in late 2011 that plans to replace 35 mm with digital had been accelerated, she panicked. “I thought, ‘Holy fright, we're not going to have any 35-mm product available to us.'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The following January, she went public with a fundraising plea. “In four months, start to finish, our little town did it,” says Ms. Nelson, 70, who operates the theatre with her son. “My musician friends held a concert that raised $2,000, there were weenie roasts, coin collections all over town.” They raised $90,000 – plus an additional $50,000 to improve the sound system. The Patricia was saved, and will celebrate its 100th anniversary this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I am so proud to live in this town,” says Ms. Nelson. “I am so proud to live here.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty years ago, casinos were illegal in Canada. Windsor, desperate to remake itself, led the way for gambling in Ontario, and – kaboom – the city's reputation went from cold to colder, exactly like a slot machine.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, though, half of Torontonians seem hooked on the idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you want to play with the big fellas, take the time to understand the rules. Make no mistake: Casinos are meticulously planned and designed to captivate. The lugubrious man cave with its dizzying jolts of neon and shrill slots is the classic, high-testosterone model. These days, Las Vegas also offers the casino hybrid, combining gambling with a strip joint, say, or a family-fun circus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most recently, Roger Thomas, the head of design for <span class="companylink">Wynn Resorts</span>, has unveiled a casino designed with a laser-sharp focus on women. Welcome to the casino's cameo as wellness spa – a safe haven! – with white leather furniture and sparkling marble floors. This is the kind of airy playground a casino-happy Toronto can expect to luxuriate in – where time is lost and people gamble more than they had ever planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The assault on Toronto to buy into the casino deal has been aggressive. Last month, there were five public consultations, as well as online voting arranged by the ever-solicitous city. Paul Godfrey, chairman of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming corporation (OLG) – who in previous careers championed the ugliest of the city's concrete armadillos by way of the Metro Convention Centre and the dumb-faced Metro Hall – has said that downtown Toronto is OLG's first choice for a casino.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My goodness, is that intended as a blessing or an insult? What may come as news to Godfrey, 74, is that the overbloated casino template, one that the OLG is demanding must handle some 4,000 parking spaces, is an antiquated version of urbanity. Despite the conceptual loveliness of its white marble interiors and lotus blossoms floating in water, a casino has no place in a city fighting – and struggling – for a vibrant urbanity. Programmatically, it's all wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shake down the bugaboo of casinos – our urbane fear of playing the slots next to potbellied truck drivers in Nickelback T-shirts – and unpack the latest in its sumptuous playground design: You'll find Medusa lurking behind the colourful, hand-blown chandeliers and garden conservatories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Playground design is airier, and generates higher levels of pleasure, so that you'll want to stay longer,” Karen Finlay, a professor at Ontario's University of Guelph, and director of the Problem Gambling Research Lab. She estimates that some 300,000 people in her province are seriously addicted to gambling, meaning they'll lie to their family or steal to support their habit. “The wealth and entitlement that the baby boomer feels,” she adds, “is a perfect match for the beautiful sanctuary of the casino.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My vote for most beautiful sanctuary: Monte Carlo Casino, initiated to buoy the treasury of the local royalty, and designed as a beaux-arts mansion (1881), in part by Paris Opera House architect Charles Garnier. Because the grand villa, with its welcoming canopy, occupies a modest footprint next to a sweeping plaza with restaurants that spill out onto public terraces affording direct views to the waterfront, I applaud that casino's urban grace. Foreigners arriving by luxury ships or jets are welcome there, though locals are prevented from gambling. I guess that's called looking after your own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem with almost every other casino in the world is that it's designed to be inward looking. Great cities pour people out of buildings and into streets and parks. But check the proposed mega-casino plan by <span class="companylink">Oxford Properties Group</span>; once three office towers and the north convention centre are demolished, the developer proposes 22 acres of continuous underground convention space – underground is certainly not the way to activate windswept Front Street – with a park that stretches over the railway lines south of the convention centre, into a zone where people do not naturally flow. The casino – about the size as the <span class="companylink">Art Gallery of Ontario</span> – will be framed within a hotel complex flanking the western end of the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compare that hermetic experience of urbanity to another epic project that Oxford is currently working on across the border: the 26-acre Hudson Yards, a mixed-use development that recently started construction on the west side of Manhattan, where open green space will connect directly to the Hudson River, and where commercial and residential towers will integrate with a school and a major cultural space. Facilitating gambling addiction is nowhere to be found on the program – that's because Mayor Michael Bloomberg has said no to casinos for Manhattan. (The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> has reported that Resorts World Casino, which opened last year in neighbourhing Queens, reports regular incidents of rage-filled gamblers punching slot maching when jackpots go cold.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few days ago, <span class="companylink">MGM Resorts International</span> announced a partnership with commercial real-estate giant <span class="companylink">Cadillac Fairview</span> to potentially develop and operate “a destination-style, integrated resort complex,” perhaps on the grounds of the Canadian National Exhibition. One-stop shopping is critical to any mega-casino development, so that revenues are generated and maintained within the complex. Don't expect visitors to wander north to support the artists' studios and indie fashion boutiques along Queen Street West. Cue the buses carrying voracious gamblers into the CNE, something I've witnessed at <span class="companylink">Casino Rama</span>, a sad gambling hall operated by the Rama first nation, within an easy drive of Orillia, Ont., or, if you're keen enough, Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all of these plans, what could date Toronto badly is the requirement for those 4,000 parking spaces. Consider that other cities with mobilized leadership (New York, Chicago, Paris, London, Singapore) are marginalizing cars to make room for new public transit, more citizen fitness and short-haul car rental.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The City of Toronto's public consultations and online voting have now closed; some time in April, the vote will go to city council, which will decide whether the casino will be coming. Bizarrely, a specific hosting fee – the city's cut for hosting the proposed behemoth – has still not been released to the City of Toronto. Meanwhile, online gambling is on the rise; large-scale casinos in Macau and Atlantic City are in serious debt. If Toronto would yank its head out of the man cave, it would realize that many other places – Hong Kong, Rome, New York, and most of Russia – have rejected the seduction of the casino.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto is a city that suffers increasingly from a scattered vision about its own urbanity – and so we blow, sadly, according to the whims of poker-face corporations. A casino undermines everything we should value about city life. It's a gamble we can't afford to make.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of implicit demands for services that have dramatically expanded the size and cost of government, and a simultaneous insistence on a low tax regime, no provincial sales tax and occasionally even a “prosperity bonus,” something had to give in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the disappearance of some $6-billion in projected oil-and-gas revenues, Albertans have a fresh opportunity to stop living on their capital, that is, to end their government's reliance on drawing down their oil-and-gas assets – and to inject some fiscal realism into the province's budget-making.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Alison Redford has spoken in a televised address about an engagingly alliterative “bitumen bubble.” But the fall of the prices that Alberta can charge for its energy exports, over the past 10 months, is not a bubble in the familiar sense of a bursting of unsustainable demand, a cyclical decline of the kind that Albertans have often suffered before. Instead, the cause is a long-term rise in the supply of energy in the United States, which means less need in that country for Alberta's oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Redford is holding an Alberta economic summit on Feb. 9, though it is hardly likely that she and Doug Horner, the Minister of Finance, will make major changes to their budget, which will be delivered less than a month later, on March 7. Rather, the summit will be part of a campaign to shift public opinion, an undertaking that may well need two or three budgets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The provincial government would be well-advised to deal first with controls on spending, and then consider tax reform later. The public is likely to be more receptive in principle to prudence of the kind that many people act upon in their private lives (or at least acknowledge to themselves that they could and should do so) – more, that is, than to the imposition of any new tax or other similar charges such as health-care premiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Alberta advantage” is a phrase associated with Ralph Klein, the former premier. It can be seen in Alberta's annual public spending on health care (according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information's most recent figures): $4,972 per person, compared with a pan-Canadian average of $3,692.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This difference approximately corresponds to the 30 per cent of <span class="companylink">Alberta's government</span> revenues that typically come from oil-and-gas royalties rather than from taxes – in other words, a depletion of capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been wise and praiseworthy efforts to replace that capital. In 1976, when Peter Lougheed was premier, the Heritage Savings Trust Fund was established to make strategic investments in new businesses, but in 1987 new payments into the fund ceased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta Sustainability Fund was established in 2003, with the less ambitious goal of providing protection against cyclical downturns in commodity prices. This respectable countercyclical intention has not been adhered to; even in some good years, the fund has been drawn upon to help make budget deficits smaller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a time of abnormally low interest rates (to a great extent a result of public policy), the raison d'être of the Sustainability Fund is itself dubious. Borrowing through issuing bonds on the open capital markets would be much less expensive to the Alberta treasury than withdrawing money from the fund, which has a better rate of return than the world's long-suffering bondholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The provincial government ought also to take a hard look at public-sector compensation. Last month, the <span class="companylink">Fraser Institute</span> published a study that concluded that public-sector employees in Alberta have an advantage of 10.3 per cent over private-sector employees. Moreover, an overwhelming majority of public-sector employees have defined-benefit pension plans, that is, pensions that are not subject to the ups and downs of government revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the province's physicians, their average revenue is 14 per cent higher than the average across Canada as a whole, according to the CIHI, as of 2010-2011, the most recent year for which the numbers have been assembled – the figure of $350,000 is somewhat misleading, as it includes staff, rent and other expenses, but the comparison with the equivalent pan-Canadian number of $307,000 is telling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before long, Alberta will have to revise its tax policies by letting go of its taboo against a provincial sales tax. The 22 years of the formerly execrated federal Goods and Services Tax have shown its worth, its efficiency and particularly its resilience through the vagaries of the business cycle; indeed, Alberta should adopt the Harmonized Sales Tax. But for the present, Ms. Redford is probably right not to push the province's citizens too far in too short a time; the exaggerated view of the degree to which they have a free-market economy, in contrast to the other provinces, is quite ingrained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Redford has overstated the element of surprise in the decline of Alberta oil exports to the United States, by comparison with what was foreseeable 12 months ago. The <span class="companylink">Bank of Montreal</span> and CIBC, both of which she herself cited in a supporting document, gave quite correct predictions on the prices Alberta would be able to charge today. The requirements of political presentation do not always encourage accuracy. But that is all the more reason for getting Alberta's on a sound basis comfortably before the next election – likely to be in 2016. That does not allow much fiscal foot-dragging.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What do we call the thing Canada is doing in Africa?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It involves our largest corporations, the federal government, public- and private-sector aid agencies, and sometimes the military. And their activities are increasingly connected, sometimes by choice, often by force of circumstance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week saw Ed Fast, the Minister of International Trade, touring some of the scores of city-sized mining, oil and infrastructure developments that Canada is creating in Nigeria and Ghana, and the development and aid activities that we've brought in to surround them. He's the third cabinet minister to visit those countries since October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you follow his steps, you realize Canada is no longer simply “doing business” or “providing aid” in Africa. What we're doing is something that bears a striking resemblance to the things Britain and France were doing in Canada two centuries ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First came the exploiters, in search of mineral wealth. Though most Canadians don't realize it, Canada is now the largest foreign mining operator in the continent, exceeding even China: We have almost $25-billion in investments in hundreds of huge projects. Our petroleum companies are gigantic players, too. And along with those miners came the people building roads and dams and buildings: Our engineering firms are among the largest on the continent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then came the trouble. The taking of resources is a rough business that tends to occur among vulnerable populations. It involves spreading money around, often paying off key people to acquire rights and win the co-operation of local groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is inevitably a political process, and it's often dirty. As a result, Canadian companies can't seem to keep out of trouble in Africa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, we learned that a Calgary oil company, <span class="companylink">Griffiths Energy International Inc</span>., had paid a $2-million bribe in a resource deal with the government of Chad. Two weeks earlier, a detailed report from <span class="companylink">Human Rights Watch</span> revealed that a mine in Eritrea owned by Canadian mining company <span class="companylink">Nevsun Resources</span> had been built in part by unpaid forced labourers provided by the Eritrean government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Quebec engineering firm <span class="companylink">SNC-Lavalin</span>, one of the largest contractors in the world, faces continuing criticism for the huge sums it paid to Moammar Gadhafi and his family in exchange for contracts worth billions, including the construction of a prison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that's just January: There have been scores of other humanitarian, political and ecological storms kicked up by Canadian companies in Africa. While their investments have created immeasurable fiscal and employment benefits, their mining colonies and drilling towns have too often become centres of scandal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So then came the government. Even though Ottawa had shifted its foreign-aid focus away from Africa a few years ago, the government has come back in force, with a new large-scale aid strategy in which its agencies work with resource companies, alongside charities and private aid groups, in a way that, in the words of International Co-operation Minister Julian Fantino, “addresses social and environmental issues of extractive sector development” and helps countries “use resource rents and investment to spur economic diversification in local communities, often focused on agricultural and agribusiness development.” It makes some sense: Canada ought to be providing this sort of aid to the people it's contacting – sometimes beneficially, sometimes otherwise – with its resource-taking activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the end effect is that Canada has landed in Africa in a big way: tearing up the land, building new towns, creating roads and pipelines and airports, and bringing in new forms of government and administration to create new economies and enforce human rights and democratic standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This bears a strong resemblance to what the military calls counterinsurgency: To make the local population tolerate your forceful acts and embrace your cause, you win over their hearts and minds by building roads, schools, water supplies and better farms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the process, though, you become something like a colonial government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada, not yet fully free from its own years as a colony, is far from comfortable with this role. We ought to find some other name, and some other shape, for our African project.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ford brothers always say the same thing when they are accused of breaking the rules: that their enemies are plotting to bring them down.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before an audit came out on Mayor Rob Ford's finances on Friday, Doug Ford was accusing left-wing critics of leading a “witch hunt” against his brother. Without producing any evidence, he suggested that unions were funding a campaign to unseat the mayor before the end of his term in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This left-wing activist group keeps coming after us,” he complained. “It's absolutely terrible for democracy.” As he has often done in the past, he said the Fords' critics are simply bitter about their defeat in 2010. “These folks have their hands in the cookie jar … and Rob has cut it off,” he told CP24 television. “They want to politically kill him,” he told reporters. “That's how much they despise Rob Ford.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you go down to root causes on this, folks, you see it's the special interest groups,” he said later. “They're going to continue going after us. Why? Because he's privatized the garbage. He's cut down on the unions. … He's cut the office budgets across the board. And when you do that – you make the cuts – they're coming after you.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is particle of truth in all that. A small group of activists have indeed been making it their job to trip up the mayor – though there is nothing like the vast left-wing conspiracy the Fords seem to imagine. But here is the point: no one would be able to come after them in the first place if they didn't leave themselves wide open by playing fast and loose with the rules. The campaign audit found that they had started spending before the formal start of the campaign, had borrowed money from the family firm and had accepted corporate donations – all “apparent contraventions” of the election-spending law. Though the amount by which they exceeded the spending limit seems small in the scheme of things – about $40,000 – the auditor cited dozens of violations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug Ford shrugged off some of the findings as minor matters of “interpretation,” but campaign-spending rules are strict for a purpose: to ensure that there is a level playing field among candidates. They also protect against undue influence and shadowy backers. The aim is to keep election funding, once conducted in smokey back rooms, open and above board. A mayor who has made transparency in government a priority should understand that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of simply following the straightforward rules that govern political life in this city, the Fords have repeatedly strayed outside of them. When they're caught, they say the rules must be wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questioned about the audit, Doug Ford said on Friday that there are “massive problems” with the City of Toronto Act that sets the rules for city governance. “There are certain things in the Toronto act regarding fundraising that you gotta look at,” he said, adding that he might even run for provincial office to change that “draconian” law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pattern has been the same throughout Mayor Ford's term. When he got into trouble with the city's Integrity Commissioner, he suggested abolishing her office, along with two other city accountability offices. Suddenly, they were “a waste of taxpayers' money.” When Ombudsman Fiona Crean suggested the mayor's office had meddled in city appointments, the Fords tried to block her reappointment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The way they frame it, they are on a righteous crusade to liberate the city from a left-wing elite. If anyone questions their conduct, it must be a plot to thwart them. They, of course, are the victims. “Very few people, very few families, would put up this harassment day in, day out. It's relentless,” Doug Ford said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, very few mayors have run afoul of the rules so often. If the mayor's enemies are taking aim at him, it is because he gives them so much ammunition.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It couldn't get any bigger than this. No way. It's Super Bowl Sunday and, as sure as the sun will rise on Monday morning, there will be an announcement that a gazillion people watched Super Bowl XLVII (Sunday, CBS, CTV, 6:30 p.m.) as the <span class="companylink">Baltimore Ravens</span> played against the <span class="companylink">San Francisco 49ers</span>.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Possibly it will be announced that the ratings indicate a gazillion-and-a-bit watched it. Eventually, there will be news reports that an eccentric in Portland, Ore., went out for a walk and declined to tune in. Television news crews will swarm the eccentric's house and ask for interviews.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada, it will be 10 per cent of a gazillion people. And that audience, if they sit round till the end, will see a spanking new, heavily promoted Canadian cop show appear on their screens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hype about Motive (Sunday, CTV, 10 p.m.) has been ubiquitous for weeks. Ceaseless promos on CTV, online, and hereabouts, in the centre of the universe, on the sides of buses and billboards. This must mean somebody thinks the show is a surefire success. Why, just the other day it was announced that ABC will air Motive this summer in the United States. (Given ABC's record this season, that's a dubious endorsement, but never mind).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before that golly-gosh announcement, the fact that Motive gets the post-Super Bowl slot indicated it was the biggest thing since … well, since something really big. Like Corner Gas maybe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much has been made of Motive's storytelling technique. Really different, is the buzz. Different from the standard police procedural, where the cops have to find out who did the dirty deed and why, as viewers follow along. In Motive, we're told off the top who the killer is. Just so viewers are certain they are looking at the varmint, on the screen it says “The Killer.” And then, inevitably, there is another person who gets the onscreen label “The Victim.” Take that, stick-in-the-mud CSI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it turns out, Motive is slick, a bit silly, very stylish and disappointingly predictable. All that promotional money has been spent on a middling-good network-style series that is just a shade shy of a total misfire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Sunday's pilot episode, there is a lot of flash, much of it falling flat. After the opening sequence signalling the killer and the victim, we meet Det. Angie Flynn (Kristin Lehman, last seen as the mayoral candidate's popsy on The Killing) arriving at a crime scene. There's brief slow motion as she gets out of the car, the better to allow us to admire her superwhite T-shirt and what's in it. “Nothing says Friday night like a homicide,” she says to another cop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stuff happens, presented in lurid high-gloss tones. There is banter. The scene shifts to a high school, where a marching band has been playing. “Nothing like the smell of sweaty polyester on a Friday night,” a teenage boy says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it's definitely Friday night, you know.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyway. There's a dead body and a killer on the loose. There are some fine, high-tension scenes before things settle into what is the usual police-procedural mode. That is, every cop is kinda zany and quick with the banter, except for Det. Oscar Vega (Louis Ferreira), who is a bit lumpen and slow. Actor Ferreira used to be known as Justin Louis, and, after working on some mediocre U.S. network series, he was very fine as a creepy killer on Durham County. Now he's Louis Ferreira and, with all due respect, the least interesting character on Motive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman steals the show as a brisk detective and single mom with an annoying teenage son. When Lauren Holly shows up as the medical examiner, the banter goes ballistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One expects to see more of Holly in later episodes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the style and pizzazz of the first episode of Motive, it is unremarkable in plotting, writing and viewer engagement. When the crime is finally solved, the clue is one of the oldest, most groan-inducing clichés in the mystery racket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also airing this weekend</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Second Liberal Leadership Debate (Saturday, CPAC, 2 p.m.) promises to be a drama of sizzling barbs and zingers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today the average person sits for 9.3 hours a day. When you add the 7.7 hours we spend sleeping, that means we are in “active mode” for seven hours a day. (To be honest, that number strikes me as high.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the warmer months, I'm all for leisurely strolls and bike rides, but in these dull days of February, my get-up-and-go instinct is waning at best. The week before last I spent two days eating pasta with butter and salt because I couldn't bring myself to walk to the grocery store in frigid weather. So yeah, my sit/standing ratio was due for an adjustment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a study conducted last year out of <span class="companylink">Louisiana State University</span>, the magic number is three – as in sitting for less than three hours a day may add two years to your life. This struck me as a preposterously ambitious goal given the eight or so daily computer hours my job requires. I suppose I could have dropped a few thousand dollars for one of those treadmill desk contraptions that will populate the workplaces of the future, but the whole point of these weekly challenges is bite-sized, attainable improvements, so instead I opted to test drive some of the less radical sloth-busting strategies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking a stand against sitting</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjustment No. 1 was to spend the first hour of every morning standing at my computer, thereby breaking the automatic sit cycle and adding an additional couple hundred hours to my annual standing tally. Initially what felt like a magnetic pull between my posterior and the empty stool made it difficult to focus. Also my legs felt tired and I frequently caught myself leaning against the counter for support, but I guess if standing up all the time was supposed to be easy, no one would have created the <span class="companylink">La-Z-Boy</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the rest of the workday, I devoted the last five minutes of every hour to quickie active sessions – low-impact jumping jacks or basic yoga. Nothing too strenuous or sweat-inducing, but just enough activity to jolt my body out of its sedentary coma. After an hour of sitting, the body's production of fat-burning enzymes decreases by as much as 90 per cent, meaning tiny bursts of activity can yield big results. Also five minutes six times a day was another few days' worth of off-the-butt time added to the annual tally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walk this way</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nilofer Merchant is an American businesswoman – a Fortune 500 type who wrote a piece for the Harvard Business Review about how her commitment to “walking meetings” has allowed her to be active on the job without cutting into productivity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four times a week she spends an hour walking and talking (or hiking and talking) with whomever she is supposed to meet with. Her technique sounded fun, simple and a lot more creatively stimulating than ye olde coffee shop, so I decided to try it out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One brave editor agreed to talk about an upcoming assignment with me while walking around in the drizzle (as discussed, all of this getting off your duff business would be a lot easier if it were June). Another time I caught up with an old friend on an hour-long stroll through the snow. Okay, so fine, we were strolling to a pub where I sunk helplessly into a bar stool, but based on my experience the key is to take small stances against sitting wherever you can. Pun intended.</p>

The originalists believe all decisions should be what the Constitution's framers would have wished them to be. The living constitutionists believe interpretations grow and change over time. And the Utah sheriffs believe that they are the highest court in the land, and their interpretation goes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All rise in the Court of Chutzpah. In an open letter to President Barack Obama, the elected members of the Utah Sheriffs Association implicitly threaten violent resistance to any attempts by the federal government to enforce Mr. Obama's executive orders on gun control.</p>

We, like you, swore a solemn oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and we are prepared to trade our lives for the preservation of its traditional interpretation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What a dangerous moment, when hysteria is fomented by the people whose job is to enforce the law. The Supreme Court is the guardian of the Constitution, not the Utah Sheriffs, or those in other largely rural states who have published similar letters. The sheriffs are reinforcing a violent society's message that violent resistance, not law, is an answer to problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps, like Martin Luther King, the Utah sheriffs are dedicated to opposing laws they consider unjust. Fair enough – then quit. Like the marriage commissioners in parts of Canada who refused to wed gay couples, they have freedom of choice. They can't be forced to do a job they don't believe in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this isn't a campaign of civil disobedience the sheriffs warn of. It's closer to a declaration of war.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is strange to be nominated for an international literary award when almost no one in your home country has heard of you. But that is what happened to Josip Novakovich. His adopted home is Canada. Who knows him? It doesn't matter now. He deserves to be heard of, and heard from.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Novakovich, one of 10 writers in the running for the $95,000 Man Booker International Prize (for a body of work available in English) is the writer as Everyman. His life was shaped by many of the terrible events of the 20th century – world war, Communism, ethnic cleansing. He left his native country to escape service in a military (the Yugoslav Federal Army) he didn't believe in. He came to the United States at 20, married, raised two children, wrote short stories and essays in English, which he learned by listening to Jimi Hendrix. Ultimately he came to Canada in 2009 to teach creative writing at Concordia University in Montreal. He will soon be a Canadian citizen.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He writes about war and cultural conflict, religious faith and discrimination, love and friendship. His prose “has an easy, elegant velocity,” the New York Times said in reviewing his only published novel, April Fool's Day, which it called “wickedly funny and deeply harrowing.” (Among his other works are three books of short stories, of which his favourite is Salvation and Other Disasters.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Novakovich gives some insight into his past in a piece published in 1994 in the Times about his father, who had a fourth-grade education. “He was drafted into the Croat Guards when World War II broke out. He deserted and joined the Communist partisans, whose atheism he could not tolerate . . . . He deserted the partisans. At the end of the war partisans captured him, tortured and starved him.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His dark humour is evident. “One day, behind closed doors, Father and his younger brother calculated the date of the second coming of Christ, three years away. Though Christ did not arrive, Father died exactly three years later. As his brother commented, Christ came for him.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like any Everyman, Mr. Novakovich is a practical man. “The award means a lot, practically. I was kind of in a slump. The whole publishing industry is so shrunken. It's extremely hard to place a book. I'm optimistic now that I can publish my [new] novel.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is lucky to have him. He deserves an audience.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's 49 points in 75 minutes for Rudy Gay. A win and a loss against two of the NBA's marquee clubs and a sense that one of the difficulties folks are having in analyzing his acquisition is it's neither specifically for the present or the future. It's both.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The immediate downside is that the <span class="companylink">Toronto Raptors</span> have given Kyle Lowry the keys to the offence and that does not inspire confidence. Not yet, at least. The <span class="companylink">Miami Heat</span> would have beaten the Raptors anyhow Sunday without Lowry's ill-conceived pass with 2:25 left and the Raptors losing by seven – thrown from the far side of the court to nobody in particular except LeBron James, whose driving dunk made it 92-83 en route to a 100-85 win at the Air Canada Centre – and while it is true that Jose Calderon did not figure in the Raptors future, exiling him to Detroit by way of Memphis has left the Raptors exposed at the point with a game against the <span class="companylink">Boston Celtics</span> on Wednesday. The Raptors are on the extreme fringes of playoff consideration – equidistant between last place and eighth – and the Celtics currently hold down the last playoff spot with seven more wins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Playing without Landry Fields, whose back spasms required a hospital visit, the Raptors cause was not helped when Lowry and Amir Johnson found themselves in foul trouble – Johnson's third came with 58 seconds left in the first half, Lowry picked up two (including his fourth) within a 57-second span less than four minutes into the second half. Gay finished with 29 points on 11-for-23 from the field and DeMar DeRozan had 27 points, including 14-for-14 from the line. “We have to play a near-perfect game, 90 to 95 per cent, to play against them,” said Raptors head coach Dwane Casey. “I thought we did that until we got into foul trouble.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gay is a wonderful athletic talent who played with one of the NBA's best defensive outfits in Memphis but there remain questions about whether he and Lowry on the court at the same time can give Casey the type of defence he fancies. The Raptors had no answer for James/Chris Bosh/Dwyane Wade in the fourth quarter, and Casey was not happy with his team's defensive rotation. Bosh had 13 fourth-quarter points in finishing with 28 while James had nine of his game-high 30 points in the fourth quarter and played the role of facilitator as much as scorer. He also had some nice words for the new-look Raptors. “He's another athletic wing,” James said. “They put a lot of pressure on your defence when they're in attack mode.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eleven-year veteran Shane Battier viewed it a little differently. He said the addition of Gay gave the Raptors a player who can “make and take a tough shot.” Do not under-estimate athleticism, he added. “You need togetherness and chemistry – that's all good stuff,” Battier said. “But it's talent that makes a big winner.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, whom was guaranteed the head-coaching job for the NBA's Eastern Conference all-stars with the win, will probably get a nice text message from Raptors general manager Bryan Colangelo for this assessment: “I'll tell you what: they've done a nice job with this team,” said Spoelstra. “They've built an identity. They have a good, young core built for the future but also the time could be now. They still have plenty of time to put it together. What they do is pressure you with that athleticism. We don't face many teams that can match us athletically and, arguably, beat us at times at certain positions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's not only those two [DeRozan and Gay]. They could field their own roster of dunk participants. But they're players as well, not just athletes.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Establishing an identity seems little comfort in a season that was supposed to be about making the playoffs. But let's see what Colangelo's follow-up act is heading into the trade deadline. Can he once again service both the present and future, and will that be enough to save his job?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the dawn of portable music, runners have relied on their playlists to pump themselves up, stay motivated or simply stave off boredom. Now there's another option: Transform your tunes into a sophisticated cruise-control device that helps you maintain a specific pace or effort level.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers at Simon Fraser University's Locomotion Lab released their Cruise Control app for Apple iOS devices last month. The idea emerged from fundamental research on how humans choose their stride rate at different walking and running speeds. And the simple fact that it works contradicts a popular misconception about the existence of an “ideal” stride for running.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many runners believe that your stride rate should be the same no matter how fast you're going, and that all runners should aspire to an ideal stride rate of 180 steps a minute – an idea rooted in informal measurements of distance runners taken at the 1984 Olympics. If that were true, the app wouldn't work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The app works. It controls your pace by subtly increasing or decreasing the speed of the music you're listening to, while monitoring your speed with the built-in GPS and accelerometers in the iPhone, according to Max Donelan, a professor of biomechanics and neurophysiology who developed the technique with PhD candidate Mark Snaterse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As long as you keep your footsteps in time with the beat of the music – a synchronization that happens almost automatically – you'll speed up and slow down on cue. With this technique, the app can keep you locked to within about 1 per cent of whatever goal pace you've programmed in, Donelan says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes in music speed are mostly imperceptible – as long as you start with tunes at roughly the right tempo. The app automatically searches your music collection for songs with a rhythm between 140 and 180 beats a minute (or between 70 and 90, in which case you'd take two steps a beat).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can also choose to set a goal heart rate instead of a goal pace, if you wear a heart-rate monitor that can communicate with your iPhone. The music will then adjust to keep your pulse as close as possible to this goal throughout the run. Or you can simply leave the app in “Free Run” mode, in which case the music will adjust to synch with your stride no matter how fast or slow you run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(With tweaks, the same technique could also be harnessed for walking and cycling. In fact, it already sort of works on the bike, according to one early reviewer who stuffed his iPhone into his cycling shorts so that it would be able to detect his pedalling rate. “It's not optimized for that,” Donelan notes drily.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underlying this whole technique is the relationship between how fast you're running, how many steps you're taking a minute and how long each step is. Donelan's research, along with dozens of studies before him, clearly shows that runners speed up by increasing both their stride rate and their stride length simultaneously. Whatever your ideal stride rate is at one speed, it will be different at other speeds. That, in turn, means that it's possible to control your speed by simply keeping time with the app-controlled beat of the music.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Donelan and Snaterse included a “cadence” mode for the app. If you want to run at a stride rate of exactly 180 beats a minute, you can program that in and the app will adjust your playlist to that cadence. Even if you don't believe in an “ideal” cadence, there are still training benefits to programming in a higher cadence than you're used to, Donelan points out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you increase cadence, you'll also automatically increase stride length – and as a result you'll run faster,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, there's no shortage of apps and gadgets that feed runners real-time information about pace and effort. The Cruise Control app's unique offering is that it makes pace control subconscious, so you don't even have to think about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Donelan sees the app as something more than a simple speedometer. “It's about fully integrating your music experience with your running experience,” he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE QUESTION</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is squash a vegetable or a starch? I was told it was off limits because it's high in carbohydrates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ANSWER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Squash is a vegetable and, in my opinion, it's a vegetable you shouldn't declare off limits. Yes, it's true that winter squashes such as acorn, butternut, buttercup, hubbard and pumpkin are starchy vegetables and, as such, they contain more carbohydrates than vegetables like leafy greens, cauliflower and bell peppers. (Zucchini and other summer squashes are non-starchy vegetables and are low in carbohydrates.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One-half cup of cooked butternut squash, for example, has 11 grams of carbohydrate and 41 calories while the same serving size of cooked broccoli has 5.6 grams of carbohydrate and 27 calories. But those extra carbs shouldn't stop you from eating winter squash. For starters, an extra 5.5 grams of carbohydrate isn't much – it's the carb equivalent of 1/8 cup of cooked pasta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of nutrition, winter squash is a far cry from refined starchy foods (the type of carbohydrate you should limit). Unlike white bread and other refined flour products, winter squash is a good source of potassium and fibre. What's more, some types are packed with beta- and alpha-carotene, antioxidants thought to help prevent heart disease and certain types of cancer. Higher intakes of alpha-carotene have also been linked to a lower risk of dying from upper digestive tract cancers, type 2 diabetes and chronic lower respiratory disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no official recommended intake for beta-carotene but experts contend that consuming 3 to 6 milligrams per day will maintain blood levels of beta-carotene in a range that's associated with a lower risk of chronic diseases. You'll meet that recommendation by eating just one-half cup of cooked pumpkin (5.1 milligrams beta carotene) or one-half cup of cooked butternut squash (4.7 mg).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You'll get more beta-carotene from vegetables if you eat them lightly cooked rather than raw. Including a little oil in your meal – only a teaspoon worth – will also increase the amount of beta-carotene that's available for your body to absorb. If you're watching carbs in order to lose weight, there's no need to avoid eating squash. In fact, if you swap squash for other starchy foods like rice and pasta you'll save calories and carbs. For instance, if you substitute spaghetti squash for pasta, you'll save 140 calories and 23 grams of carbs per cup – and get double the fibre and six times the potassium.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘You're only ever this weightless in the womb, or in outer space,” says Jesse Sandiford, minutes after I've tentatively stepped onto a massive trampoline at Mississauga's Sky Zone Indoor Trampoline Park.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's 9 a.m. on a Saturday and I'm about to partake in SkyRobics, an aerobics class conducted on a trampoline. It's purported to have the calorie-burning power of plyometrics – the form of explosive jump training made popular by the Insanity DVD series – minus the joint stress, all for a reasonable $11.50 per session.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Balance-challenged as I am on planet Earth, the extreme bounciness of the 27-metre-long trampoline throws me off guard. We spend the first 10 minutes of class practising jumping. Although I don't fall, I'm also careful to never clear more than a foot. (The recent 30 Rock episode, in which Liz Lemon refers to trampolines as “hymen demolishers” and “death traps,” is still top of mind.) After surviving the warmup, we proceed to “rouncing” – skipping across the length of the tramp, then walking back. It's a lot harder than it sounds: Movements need to be controlled or you'll fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We divide into two groups, the more advanced jumpers on one half of the trampoline, beginners on the other. While the advanced group spends the rest of the class in a circuit of sprints, squats, burpees and rouncing, we newbies spend the next 30 minutes practising various jumps: jacks, bringing our knees to our chests, touching our heels to our butts, and jumping back and forth and side to side. We also attempt to “fly,” jumping as high as we can while fluttering our arms back and forth, which makes me feel as though I'm in a Fatboy Slim video.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's undeniably fun – there are worse ways to spend a Saturday morning than bouncing around to your heart's content – but also a hell of a workout. (Aside from all the jumping, the instability of the tramp increases core activation as your body constantly tries to steady itself. Abdominal exercises are particularly intense: My stomach muscles tremble about 10 times more than usual while planking.) By the end of the jump segment, I nearly have to crawl to my water bottle. Aside from exhaustion, I'm also more than a little dizzy, apparently common among first-timers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 60-minute class flies by – it feels more like playtime than a workout – and I leave on a trampoline-induced high. I haven't had this much fun exercising in ages, and it's effective to boot, at least judging from the fact that my quads burn well into Monday. I'd definitely try SkyRobics again, Liz Lemon be damned. In terms of trampolines, I've experienced a true leap of faith.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in Quentin Tarantino's film Django Unchained, residents of a frontier Texas town circa 1858 are scandalized by the sight of a black man in their saloon. The scene is reminiscent of the one in Mel Brooks's more blatantly satirical Blazing Saddles, in which frontier townsfolk are shocked by the appearance of the stylish black lawman, Sheriff Bart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no doubt these movies accurately portray the inherent racism of that era, but like other western films and TV programs – Bonanza and The Rifleman, for example – they leave the mistaken impression that a black cowboy would have been so rare a sight in the Old West as to be beyond contemplation. Hollywood, in other words, would have us believe that the West was as white as driven snow.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truth is that the West – most famously in Canada by John Ware – was filled with people of all colours, including a significant number of blacks as well as Mexican and native cowboys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 1,000 black men, women and children, mostly from Oklahoma, settled in Saskatchewan and Alberta between 1897 and 1911. South of the border, according to the Black American West Museum in Denver, one out of three cowboys was black.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, Deadwood Dick (1854-1921), whose real name was Nat Love, was born a slave in Tennessee but lived a heroic life in the West. He earned his nickname performing at a rodeo in Deadwood City in the Dakota Territory in 1876, shared drinks with Billy the Kid and claimed to have received no fewer than 14 bullet wounds during his cowboy life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His portrait photograph shows a proud and confident character fully decked out in cowboy hat, neckerchief, chaps, six-shooter, saddle and Winchester rifle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though you wouldn't know it from Paul Newman and Robert Redford's epic Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, black cowboy Walter Jackson (1887-1976) rode with the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang for part of his colourful career. He was also the son of a cowboy and is thought to be the first black person born in Montana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether his travels took him to the Bar U Ranch southwest of Calgary, where the Sundance Kid (Harry Longabaugh) once worked as a ranch hand, is unknown. But it's well established that Canada's most notable black cowboy, the aforementioned John Ware (1845-1905), was a familiar face at the Bar U.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Born a slave on a cotton plantation and raised on a ranch in northern Texas, Ware drove cattle between Texas, Montana and Canada before finding work at the Bar U. Seeing an opportunity to make a life for himself in Southern Alberta, he started his own ranch of several hundred cattle near the Red Deer River northeast of the current town of Duchess in 1882. His home has been preserved for visitors at Dinosaur Provincial Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ware was so well regarded in the community that his funeral is reported to have been a major event. Last year, Canada issued a postage stamp in his honour to mark Black History Month. His brand hangs proudly in Calgary's highbrow Ranchmen's Club, and schools and other buildings carry his name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The iconic Bill Picket (1870-1932) may be the best-known black cowboy. A celebrated innovator of the rodeo sport of steer wrestling, he performed in Canada, Britain, South America and across the United States with the likes of Buffalo Bill and Will Rogers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's little question that black cowboys and their families faced, overcame and, at times, succumbed to intolerable racism, but they weren't the oddity portrayed by the entertainment industry. Hollywood's “whiting out” of their contributions continues to be a grave disservice to courageous men and women and their role in our shared pioneer history.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seed (City, 8:30 p.m.) is deeply silly and the kind of good, off-kilter dumb comedy that we can do with aplomb in Canada. Especially out of Halifax, it seems. There's no recipe, but among the requirements are characters who are fabulously immature, plus some sharp, unostentatious writing and a version of stoner humour that works even if you're not five miles high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The publicity material for Seed refers to the main character as “a village idiot,” which is useful info because, on first introduction to Harry (Adam Korson), you do wonder if you want to stick with this hoser. His girlfriend is leaving him, he's kinda oblivious to that, and then there's a knock at the door. It's a little kid, who announces that Harry is his dad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not giving too much away to reveal that somebody hacked into a sperm-bank computer and was able to determine the names of donors. Thus Harry, a bartender, is obliged to meet a passel of kids he has sired, and their moms. Harry is an idiot but an idiot who moseys breezily through life, not hurting anyone. The show is in many ways a celebration of sophomoric behaviour and twentysomething slacker lifestyle, but it expands to be a lot more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Harry encounters nine-year-old Billy, who has two mothers (Amanda Brugel and Stephanie Mills), he's told by 15-year-old Anastasia (Abby Ross) that he's her dad too. She's the daughter of a couple who couldn't conceive – a psychologist (Laura De Carteret) and a neurotic lawyer (Matt Baram). Meanwhile, another woman, Rose (Carrie-Lynn Neales, who is a delight), turns out to be pregnant and, thanks to complications too weird to explain here, Harry is the dad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a lot going on and, at the same time, nothing. Seed touches lightly on gay marriage, non-traditional families and kids who are troubled by their parents and school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there's a theme, it's that everybody just gets along, sometimes with helpful advice from the village idiot, a character who is untainted by the neuroses of being grown-up and burdened by middle-class mores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot depends on Korson (who has a lot of theatre experience and a few small TV and film roles), and he's superb as the immature Harry, who has a natural sense of right and wrong and a bizarre brand of common sense. He's in almost every scene and, in the two episodes I watched, doesn't wear out his welcome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The series was created by newcomer Joseph Raso and developed by Raso and Mark Farrell (also a producer and writer on the show), the latter being a 22 Minutes and Corner Gas veteran. Karen Wentzell, formerly a Trailer Park Boys producer, also produces here. While the production company is Vancouver-based Force Four Entertainment, Seed was made in Halifax using a lot of local talent and it shows – there's that cheerful, expansive weirdness that characterizes Trailer Park Boys, Mr. D and other emanations from that neck of the woods. Thus, Seed is dumb and adorable, and ours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also airing tonight</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday Mornings (Bravo, 10 p.m.) is a very earnest new medical drama created by David E. Kelley, who begat Ally McBeal, Boston Public and Harry's Law. (It was made for the cable channel TNT.) Unlike medical shows that seek to copy the steamy hook-up scenarios of Grey's Anatomy, this one is all medicine and no messing. Based on the novel by CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta, the show takes its title from a ritual at the hospital where it is set – the Monday morning staff meetings where boss doctor Harding Hooten (Alfred Molina), the chief of surgery, cross-examines the staff on work they have performed the previous week. He excoriates some of them. Those scenes are good, gripping drama, but much of the rest seems leaden. Mind you, given its seriousness, some people might find it a pleasant change from medical shows that are more about sex than surgery.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Clarity Act protects the rights and interests of all Canadians, especially Quebeckers. It guarantees that Quebeckers will never lose their membership in Canada unless they clearly intend to do so. It guarantees all Canadians that the breakup of their country will never be negotiated unless the population of a province has clearly stated its desire to withdraw from Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enacted in 2000 to give effect to the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>'s opinion concerning Quebec's secession, the Clarity Act establishes that the House of Commons must ascertain the existence of a clear majority in answer to a clear question before the <span class="companylink">government of Canada</span> may begin secession talks. It also provides that the government, during such negotiations, should follow the principles set out by the Supreme Court, including the principle of minority protection.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the leadership of Alexa McDonough, the New Democratic Party supported the Clarity Act at the time, along with Ed Broadbent, Roy Romanow and Gary Doer. Now, however, the NDP, under Thomas Mulcair, wants to replace the act with a bill full of holes, and whose main weaknesses deserve mention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sponsored by NDP MP Craig Scott, Bill C-470, an act “respecting democratic constitutional change,” would apply to all constitutional requests that the Quebec government may seek to support through a referendum. Thus, secession – the splitting apart of Canada – is treated as merely one issue among others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill enacts these rules for Quebec only. Would a referendum be more or less valid depending on the province in which it is held?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No federation on the planet is governed through provincial referendums being held on issues under federal jurisdiction. That would be politically untenable. And what would we do, should two separate provincial referendums yield constitutionally contradictory results – on equalization, for example?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill provides that the federal government will have to re-evaluate the clarity of the referendum question on secession. The Clarity Act gives this role to the House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is more democratic for the latter to make that assessment. Since when has the NDP wanted the government to act without the approval of the House on critical issues?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This bill contradicts the opinion of the Supreme Court by giving the Quebec Court of Appeal the role of deciding the clarity of the question. In its opinion on Quebec secession, the Supreme Court assigned the responsibility for assessing clarity to politicians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This bill also violates the Supreme Court opinion by setting a threshold in advance for evaluating the clear majority. And yet, the court issued the opinion that a clear majority had to be determined “in the circumstances under which a future referendum vote may be taken.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill sets this threshold at a single vote difference. The NDP, which requires a two-thirds majority to amend its own constitution, is prepared to dismantle Canada on the basis of a recount. If 50 per cent plus one is a clear majority, then what would be an unclear majority?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, contrary to the Clarity Act, this bill does not use the turnout rate as a criterion for evaluating a clear majority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the Clarity Act, the bill says nothing about the principles that should guide the federal government when negotiating on secession – in particular, the protection of minority rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP's bill deprives Canadians, and Quebeckers especially, of the guarantees provided by the Clarity Act. It shows the extent to which the NDP is sinking into intellectual confusion by trying to please the “separatists” at the expense of the rights of Quebeckers and of all Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stéphane Dion, Liberal MP for Saint-Laurent-Cartierville and critic for Democratic Reform, sponsored the Clarity Act when he was Liberal minister responsible for intergovernmental affairs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to the timely and surgically effective intervention of hundreds of French paratroopers and almost 3,000 support forces, the cities and towns of northern Mali have been cleared of criminal Islamists linked to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Keeping them from returning, filtering in from desert redoubts, will be the job of almost 5,000 African troops from six countries plus what is left of the Malian army. The United Nations says it, too, will send peacekeepers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The French have shown how to bomb, strafe and chase militants out of cities and towns where the local inhabitants had been held captive and subjected to mindless sharia-rationalized brutalities and strictures. The local Muslim population, now rejoicing, has resumed playing music, dressing in bright colours, sharing intimate joys and pursuing normal lives without fear of fundamentalist punishments. No longer are Islamists able to cut off the hands of alleged thieves or to stone alleged adulterers to death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the big tasks ahead are how to continue to protect the civilian population in northern Mali, how to pursue the Islamists into the deep desert north of Timbuktu and Kidal, and how to provide meaningful autonomy for the Tuareg, who are northern Mali's main minority and who originally sparked the insurgency. The French (assisted by British and Canadian trainers) will also want to forge both the Malian army and the West African soldiers, who have followed the French northward, into a cohesive and strongly led force. That will take time and skill; creating a responsible and responsive command structure from among so many different national elements, plus the fractured Malian army, will be extremely complex and frustrating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fundamental to each of these tasks is re-democratizing Mali itself. From 1992 to 2012, Mali was a democracy, albeit corrupt and only adequately governed. Then, in March, disaffected junior officers led by Captain Amadou Sanogo sent President Amadou Toumani Touré packing and established military control of the country. They blamed the democratic civilian government, rather than their own ranks, for letting insurgents gain strength in the north; the government had not provided the army with sufficient resources – or so the junior officers complained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the coup leaders did not set out to mobilize against al-Qaeda in the north. Instead, they acquired resources in and around the capital, Bamako, ousted a civilian prime minister (someone they had installed) and tried to prevent West African leaders and the <span class="companylink">African Union</span> from nudging Mali back onto the democratic path.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interim President Dioncounda Traoré invited the French troops into Mali last month when it became clear that the mutinous local army would continue to squabble, rather than head north, and when Ansar Dine and other al-Qaeda-affiliated insurgents began attacking southern Mali and heading toward unprotected Bamako. It is now time for Nigerian, Togolese and other West African forces in Mali to curtail the freedom of the Malian coup leaders and shore up the interim civilian government. Mr. Traoré has promised to hold national elections this summer, which might conceivably restart the democratic process. But first he and neighbouring countries will have to find a way to permanently sideline Capt. Sanogo and the other junior officers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If they can place Mali into a kind of temporary African trusteeship, civility and good governance can gradually be restored to the country (where three-quarters of the population live in the south, especially in Bamako and Ségou), while autonomous arrangements are made with and for the Tuareg belonging to the secular National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (a Tuareg word for northern Mali).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simultaneously, the remnants of Ansar Dine and al-Qaeda need to be pursued northward and eastward beyond Timbuktu and Kidal into the mountains and desert of the Sahara. That is what the French are now doing. Capturing or otherwise eliminating the 2,000 or so fleeing militants will be trying – but made easier if Algeria closes its border with Mali and secures it with its own hardened troops. (Algeria is now furious with Ansar Dine, in part its own creation, so that fury may help.) According to former Canadian ambassador Robert Fowler, who was held captive in the Sahara for five months by a group of Tuareg militants, the insurgents know how to live in and off the desert. Of the West African troops, only those of Chad have any experience chasing small groups in a desert setting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The French think they can now retreat proudly. But they will be needed as a deterrent, and as a prod and example to the West Africans and the Malians, for months to come. Likewise, European and Canadian training forces will have a long but very critical slog. Ultimately, however, Mali as a democracy and northern Mali as an oasis of good government and non-fundamentalist Islam are definitely worth saving and securing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Angus Reid's Mario Canseco decided to gauge the public's mood on some issues in advance of this spring's election, he figured it was a good time to also see how people were feeling about the province's two main political leaders – Liberal Premier Christy Clark and NDP Leader Adrian Dix.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pollster gave the more than 800 people who participated in the firm's Internet survey in late January nine pairs of contradictory attributes from which they could choose. (It is a sample size that produces a margin of error of 3.5 per cent, 19 times out of 20). Respondents were asked to select the six that best described their current view of the two leaders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The options were: out of touch/in touch; arrogant/down to earth; secretive/open; inefficient/efficient; strong/weak; compassionate/uncaring; foolish/intelligent; honest/dishonest and boring/exciting. They were also given the choice of ticking none of the above.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even for a province as politically cantankerous as British Columbia, the results – provided exclusively to The Globe and Mail – were surprising. Specifically, the level of antipathy people appear to have towards Ms. Clark, even among party supporters, has to be a concern for the Liberals – especially with the beginning of an election campaign just over two months away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top four attributes people ascribed to the Premier were all negative: out of touch led the pack at 41 per cent, while 39 per cent of respondents said they found her arrogant, 33 per cent secretive and 33 per cent inefficient. The fifth most popular adjective to describe the Liberal Leader was intelligent at 31 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After that, it was more negatives: dishonest, 27 per cent; weak and foolish both received 22. The rest of the survey for the Premier looked like this – strong, 19 per cent; uncaring, 18, down to earth, 16; compassionate, 15; open, 12; honest, 11; in touch, 10; boring, 9; efficient, 9; exciting, 4 and none of the above, 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naturally, people who identified themselves as voting for the NDP in 2009 were more likely to associate a negative word or phrase with Ms. Clark. But even people who said they voted Liberal in the last election were not kind to the Premier. For instance, 33 per cent of them said out of touch was among the words or phrases that best described her. Only intelligent, at 44 per cent, got a higher score among those who said they voted Liberal last time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third-highest choice among those who voted for the party the last time around was arrogant at 31 per cent, while inefficient received the next greatest number of ticks at 29 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So how did the Premier fare compared to her bitter rival Mr. Dix? Not well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top four choices to describe the NDP Leader were all positive. Intelligent led the list at 36 per cent, with down to earth in second spot at 25 per cent, in touch at 22 and open at 21. After that it was a bit of a hodgepodge: secretive, 20 per cent; boring, 20; arrogant, 20; dishonest, 19; honest, 18; compassionate, 17; strong, 16; efficient, 14; out of touch, 14; inefficient, 13; weak, 12; foolish, 11; uncaring, 7 per cent and exciting, 3. A surprisingly high number of people – 20 per cent – said none of the above. (Which would indicate Mr. Dix is still an unknown commodity to many.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should be noted that Mr. Dix found much more support among his base – people who voted NDP in the last election – than the Premier found among hers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what explains the reaction to the Premier?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I would say that the negative feelings towards [Ms.] Clark are a combination of two factors,” said Mr. Canseco, vice-president of Angus Reid Public Opinion. “They are the result of the changing nature of the [government's policy] agenda and also the fact the Liberals have been in power for such a long time and some voters may already be tired and looking for change.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is Mr. Canseco's belief that, for all her touted communication skills, Ms. Clark has failed to make any kind of emotional connection with voters. On top of that, she is lugging around quite a bit of negative luggage from the Gordon Campbell era. The key challenge for Ms. Clark over the short-term is trying to convince the public she is someone who cares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Canseco said the attitudes in this survey reflect the results of more recent voter preference polls that put the Liberals anywhere from 10 to 15 points behind the NDP. Some of that gap is the result of supporters abandoning the governing party for the New Democrats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Even if the B.C. Conservatives were to disappear, the Liberals are still losing one fifth of their 2009 voters to the NDP,” he said. “The Liberals may be doing well in winning the battle for the B.C. Conservative window shopper, but they have another battle to bring back those who don't particularly like [Ms.] Clark and don't regard [Mr.] Dix as a threat.”</p>

The machinery of the state is being used at great cost to prosecute a man whose adult life has been a struggle against pain of one sort or another.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the constitutionality of Canada's medical marijuana law. That law puts doctors in the position of gatekeepers. Doctors need to sign a form before people like Mr. Mernagh can legally possess marijuana. A lower court had struck down the law, saying that most doctors refused to sign that form, and so the right of sick people to use medical marijuana was illusory. The appeal court said it is a “medical exemption,” not a right; and even if “the evidence established that the medical profession was refusing en masse [to sign the form],” one judge said, “that would not necessarily make the defence illusory in the relevant sense.” Some defence. Some exemption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The appeal court did not accept evidence offered by a lower court that most doctors refuse to sign the form. Here, then, is the <span class="companylink">Canadian Medical Association</span>'s conflicted advice to doctors: “While continuing to oppose the medical use of marijuana and recommending that physicians not participate in the program because of the failure of governments and manufacturers to provide adequate information regarding safety, CMA accepts that physicians who feel qualified to recommend medical marijuana to their patients do so in accordance with the regulations.” (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mernagh, and the taxpayers of Canada, should not be paying such a steep price for doctors' honest doubts. There is no crime here.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Vancouver to St. John's, the demand for French immersion has been soaring out of sight. Anxious parents camp out on the sidewalk to snag precious enrolment spots for their kids. School districts such as the sprawling Peel Region west of Toronto have been forced to introduce a lottery system. About 12 years ago, just 10 per cent of the region's Grade 1 students were enrolled in French immersion. Today it's 25 per cent.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's driving the demand? Is it the Trudeau generation, who want to pass along our bilingual heritage to their kids?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Er, no. The main allure of French immersion is that it provides all the benefits of a private school without the tuition costs (or so parents hope). They've heard about those brain-science studies that say bilingualism confers important cognitive benefits. If that's true, then depriving your child of French immersion is practically child abuse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parents who are ambitious for their children use French immersion as a form of streaming. Their kids do very well in school – not because they're learning French, but because they'd do well anywhere. These are the same kids who started out in Montessori school. Their parents know that peer groups matter and that French-immersion classes are full of other bright, accomplished children. There are very few children with behavioural problems, special-education or ESL students in French immersion (although it's worth noting that the craze has spread to affluent immigrant parents). French immersion is also a way to get the benefits of a top public school even if you can't afford to live near one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if you actually expect your child to wind up speaking fluent French, you might be disappointed. Attrition rates are high, and language proficiency is surprisingly low. Some parents are dismayed because their kids don't become proficient in either language. Some of them struggle in science and math. And after graduation, many of them never use their French again. Why would they? They don't need it unless they live in Quebec or New Brunswick. “After 13 years in French immersion, my son has no interest in speaking it,” one mother told me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of this should come as a surprise. Bilingualism isn't easy, and unless you are immersed in another language outside of school, you may never become fluent. Also, French-immersion teachers are in extremely short supply, and not all of them are competent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But any rational analysis of French immersion is almost impossible to find. And the response of school systems to these practical problems has been to deny them. Instead of supporting a few excellent programs, school systems across Canada have scrambled to expand them and water them down. They often offer immersion programs that begin in kindergarten or Grade 1, not because kids need instruction at such an early age to become proficient (they don't), but because parents demand it. When New Brunswick decided to cancel French immersion in the early grades a few years ago, activist parents all but rioted in the streets.They even took the government to court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's all about the parents,” says Jim Croll, co-author of the report that recommended the change. Naturally, every parent wants what's best for their children. But there's only so much money to go around. What happens when some parents are more vocal than others? Mr. Croll says, “We are shortchanging a great number of our kids for our own social reasons.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By now, a lot of people are familiar with the Netflix experience – freedom followed by frustration.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The freedom is about being able to watch movies or an entire season of a TV series at any time. That's nice. Binge-watching on the weekend or, for insomniacs, all-night gorging on any night. Then comes the frustration. The movie selection seems smaller than promised. You can see all the Spider-Man movies you want, but that indie movie you read about, the one that isn't at the local multiplex, isn't on Netflix either. And the TV shows you hoped to see, the ones on HBO or Showtime, they're missing too. You can see Pretty Little Liars over and over until you can recite the dialogue, but Season 1 of Girls? Not there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new series House of Cards is meant to establish Netflix as the new HBO, the new Showtime, the new purveyor of must-see, talked-about, quality TV. The 13-part series is compensation for all the missing serious-content TV – and all of the episodes were unleashed on the weekend, to some fanfare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The series matches the general Netflix experience. Oh, sure it's freeing to watch a new series in one giant gulp and not have to wait for a new episode to be delivered each week. But it's deeply frustrating to find that House of Cards is ordinary when it could be great and, eventually, boring when it should be brilliant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based, loosely, on the 1990 BBC miniseries of the same title, it's all about inside-Washington power broking, betrayal and bitterness. And, lending an edge of veracity, it's emphatically in the present, with a new president being inaugurated in January of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Directed – for the first episodes – by David Fincher (the Oscar-winning movie The Social Network) and written in the main by Beau Willimon (the movie Ides of March), it is in the hands of two people who have no experience with long-form television, and, boy, does it matter. The series looks good and starts strongly with Kevin Spacey commanding things as Francis (Frank) Underwood, the Democratic House Majority Whip. Expecting to be appointed Secretary of State, Frank is seriously angry but near-silent when he's passed over and told to keep working in Congress to get the new president's agenda on track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mere minutes after being told the bad news, Frank is conspiring with his wife Claire (Robin Wright) and his chief of staff to wreak revenge and undermine an administration that has scorned him. It's a long, elaborate game he's got planned. From the get-go, Frank addresses the camera in a southern drawl (he's from South Carolina), oozing contempt for others and promising a terrible vengeance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the opening episodes there is grimness to the proceedings and the look of the series. It's a very wintry Washington we're looking at. While Underwood and his wife proceed with their cold calculations, other characters, weaker than them, are unveiled. There's the ambitious young reporter for The Washington Herald (based on the Washington Post, with a Katharine Graham-type owner pulling some strings) named Zoe (Kate Mara) who wants power. There's Congressman Pete Russo (Corey Stoll) with multiple weaknesses – drink, drugs and women. Both are pawns for Underwood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is absorbing until we get to the scenes at The Washington Herald. For a series that sets its sights on a ferocious depiction of the ruthlessness of politics, it is bizarre to present a major newspaper as this naive and ignorant about the Internet. Zoe wants a blog. This is scoffed at. The paper runs a devastating story, and senior editors sit around in amazement looking at the online traffic. When a victim of Underwood's vengeance is torn apart by a newspaper story, he actually finds out by reading the newspaper at his desk. In the morning. This is to be scoffed at – in any political world approaching reality, he'd be alerted hours earlier, probably by <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>. And, in a later episode that points to the wobbly direction of the drama, a senior editor dismisses <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> as “a fad.” Way to go with the realism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things have gone awry by Episode 5. The subtlety established in the first hour has evaporated. What ensue in the fifth hour are what are best called “movie moments.” That is, there are near-magical twists that belong in some stand-up-and-cheer movie, not serious television.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither Fincher nor Willimon is a TV auteur, and House of Cards does not develop with the organic storytelling steadiness of the best of television. Great long-form TV, now in abundance, uses storytelling growth through the power of suggestion, the deft placement of building blocks of plot and a richness of character development afforded by the long arc of a 10- to 13-hour narrative. Of course, it's not about veracity only. It doesn't matter if the ad industry in the 1960s didn't operate exactly as portrayed on Mad Men. What matters is the symmetry of the plotting and the slow build of the psychological drama at work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House of Cards is, eventually, a soaper that leans heavily on movie tropes and, as a result, goes off the rails. It's fast-paced silliness with a sheen of seriousness that is overplayed. One example – Frank has a fetish for ribs, always cooked by a guy from back home who can be called upon day or night. We get it. Frank is a carnivore, eating other people for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Yeah, do we get it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The series is no turning point in TV, cable or Internet divisions. Kelsey Grammer's TV series Boss did politics better. Showtime's House of Lies covers the consulting and lobbying rackets with more scathing cleverness (and uses the address-the-camera technique with greater skill). The Sopranos dealt with male power, intimidation and secrecy with more aplomb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nice try, Netflix, but House of Cards is ho-hum drama, reaching for but failing to find the sweet spot of the very best of contemporary TV. With the freedom to make it great – $100-million reportedly spent on it – the final result is frustrating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adam Oates is driving a change in culture in his first job as an NHL head coach but his skill as a communicator smoothed the way in what can be a huge challenge for a rookie.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Oates took over from Dale Hunter last summer he erased a potential headache quickly by winning over Alexander Ovechkin, who once operated by his own rules. Ovechkin was not happy playing under Hunter's strict defensive style last season, but even though Oates also preaches defence first he was able talk the reluctant superstar into playing along with a more restrictive system for the first time in his life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“First of all, you've got to respect them. You've got to respect who it is, and I do,” Oates said without naming Ovechkin. “You've got to get his trust, which is second, and when he trusts you, you can try to provide information. It's not about changing anybody. It's about adding to their game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But until they trust you, there's going to be a wall there, and I understand that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ovechkin said if there was a wall, it came down quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I just feel trust,” he said recently. “It's the most important thing for any player. When you feel trust for your coach it's unbelievable and you want to go play for him right away. When I met him I just felt it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hard part of the culture change was probably accomplished by Hunter, who replaced Bruce Boudreau in November, 2011. General manager George McPhee decided the change to defensive hockey caused by the Capitals' playoff flops needed to accelerate due to continued freelancing by the likes of Ovechkin and rushing defenceman Mike Green. Hunter, who is not big on positive reinforcement with star players, quickly installed a simple man-to-man defensive game amid much resentment before deciding to return to junior hockey last spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Oates came along he had an easier time introducing his system, which allows for more offensive movement than Hunter's. “I think there's a bit of a balance here. It's a lot easier to adjust with him than between Bruce [Boudreau] and Hunter,” Green said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Considering the depth of the change Oates is undertaking, it is easy to believe him when he insists progress is being made despite being in last place in the NHL's Eastern Conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After beating the <span class="companylink">Philadelphia Flyers</span> 3-2 last Friday for their second win of the season, the Caps played well enough against the powerful <span class="companylink">Pittsburgh Penguins</span> but lost 6-3 on Sunday. They will get a chance to show they are on the right track Tuesday night against a team more in their weight class, the <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Capitals may be last place in the NHL's Eastern Conference less than two years after finishing first but what Oates is doing is necessary – the star system that allowed Ovechkin to do as he pleased was doomed in a league where coaches and systems are king. While Ovechkin enjoyed three consecutive seasons of 50 goals or more, the Capitals were tearing up the regular season as well, culminating with 54 wins and the Presidents' Trophy for finishing first overall in 2009-10. But when the other teams got serious about checking in the playoffs, Ovechkin was easily shut down and the Caps were gone in the first or second round.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hence the arrival of Oates toting the anti-star defensive system he learned as an assistant coach with the quintessential team-first franchise, the <span class="companylink">New Jersey Devils</span>. He summed up his philosophy the other day when someone asked how Ovechkin was going to score amid his increased defensive expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The play comes from the system and the team doing the job correctly,” Oates said. “You can't design for one guy. He'll get his touches like everyone else.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As one of the foot soldiers pointed out, the lack of playoff success made for willing subjects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“[Oates] doesn't want guys to run around and do their thing,” said checking forward Troy Brouwer, who won a Stanley Cup with the <span class="companylink">Chicago Blackhawks</span> in 2010 and then came to Washington in a trade for a first-round draft pick as part of the movement away from run-and-gun hockey. “Before I got here, it worked for them in the past and it's just not that type of game any more. Guys clue into it, other teams figure it out and try to shut you down.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To paraphrase the poet, what a piece of work is Mammo.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Councillor Giorgio Mammoliti – Mammo to City Hall buffs – is often described in newspaper stories as colourful, the word that reporters use when they mean goofy. He has advocated turning the Toronto islands into a red-light district. He once took off his shirt in the city council chamber to protest against a nude beach on Hanlan's Point. He has said he wants to “weed out the communists” from Toronto. In his failed run for mayor in 2010, he called for arming bylaw-enforcement officers and spending billions to build a subway down Jane Street, which just happens to run along the border of his York West ward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, like Mayor Rob Ford, Mr. Mammoliti is in the soup over his campaign spending. At a hearing on the matter Monday, an auditor described “questionable” accounting in a shoebox campaign that had “no idea” what its income or expenses were. Mr. Mammoliti attempted to wriggle off the hook by arguing that the violations were (sound familiar?) inadvertent. If he tried his best to stay within the limit but failed, should he really be prosecuted, asked his lawyer at Monday's audit committee hearing. Are you trying to say that the spending limits prescribed by law are mere guidelines, rejoined a skeptical member of the audit panel. It voted to forge ahead with legal proceedings against Mr. Mammoliti for overspending his limit by more than $12,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this would be of minimal interest if he were simply a harmless blowhard in quest of the next headline. Under Mr. Ford, he has become something more than that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mammoliti began his life in politics as an NDPer. After leading a union chapter of maintenance workers, he won a seat in the provincial legislature in 1990 and served in premier Bob Rae's government. He earned a well-deserved infamy by campaigning against spousal benefits for gay couples, breaking ranks with NDP colleagues on the issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At City Hall, he swung further to the right but often clashed with Mr. Ford, who represented a next-door ward in suburban northwest Toronto. Mr. Ford famously called him a “Gino Boy.” Mr. Mammoliti launched a human-rights complaint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this is a man who always has an eye for the main chance. When Mr. Ford became mayor in 2010, Mr. Mammoliti became his new best friend. Any time the mayor was in trouble, Mr. Mammoliti would appear to argue Mr. Ford's side. He even came down to the City Hall Press Gallery to defend Mr. Ford when a woman accused the mayor of giving her the finger from his car. At city council meetings, Mr. Mammoliti would wrangle votes for the mayor by turning his thumb up or down to signal which way Ford allies should vote. Naturally, that led to the creation of a <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> account called Mammoliti's Thumb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there were ever a fair-weather friend, though, Mr. Mammoliti is it. When an initial court ruling ordered Mr. Ford ousted from office over conflict-of-interest charges, the arch-opportunist promptly quit the mayor's executive committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that the ruling has been overturned, Mr. Mammoliti is singing a different tune. Last month he was musing about coming back on the Ford Team. Weirder still, he was saying he only quit executive in the first place so he could investigate a shadowy plot to do “personal damage” to him and others. The plotters, he suggested, were tampering with phones and trailing their victims. He has yet to produce any proof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His antics have done Mr. Ford no favours. It was Mr. Mammoliti who popped up to propose the wildly unrealistic idea of replacing a 2-per-cent property-tax increase in the recent city budget with a tax freeze. When the mayor startled councillors by supporting the idea – effectively voting against his own budget – it overshadowed one of his administration's real achievements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mammoliti has ceased to be an entertaining sideshow act in a mayoralty that produces enough sideshows of its own. If Mr. Ford hopes to move beyond all the goofball eruptions and get back on track, it should steer well clear of him.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comedian Redd Foxx once made a crack about how “health nuts are going to feel stupid some day.” They'll be “lying in hospitals dying of nothing.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You've got to wonder watching the Liberals these days if they are going to meet the same fate. They're not dying of nothing just yet, but what a collection of bores they've become.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest manifestation came in Winnipeg on the weekend in the second of their so-called leadership debates. The Manitoba snoozer was so bad, it was generally agreed, that right up there on the highlight reel was Marc Garneau's proclamation that he enjoyed doing chores around the house, in particular vacuuming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debate moderator, a lob-ball throwing party insider, had asked the candidates to tell viewers something about themselves that people might not know. Well, revealed the former astronaut, there's nothing quite like navigating the vacuum from room to room, feeling it suck up “the dust bunnies.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His love of hoovering prompted one of the few disagreements of the afternoon when another candidate opined that he hated vacuuming. Sheer drudgery, he said. The two men, to the relief of all, did not come to blows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are nine contestants in the Liberal race. None of them appear to realize as they traverse the country stirring up apathy that, speaking of vacuums, the party is in one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Winnipeg forum, even more boring than the first debate in Vancouver, was a content-free zone. The contestants barely landed a punch on Stephen Harper. They barely laid a glove on one another. They avoided discussion of most of the pressing issues of the day. They uttered not a memorable phrase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a party in third place – at a historic low. The Liberal brand, most agree, needs rebranding, and you might think this would produce a sense of urgency and some heady, imaginative thinking from the candidates. Such is Justin Trudeau's perceived lead that the other eight candidates are seen as long shots. They've got nothing to lose. They can go for it, throw out some radical ideas, bludgeon the Conservatives, tear a few strips off Mr. Trudeau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But nothing could stop the torrent of platitudes. If Mr. Harper was watching, I'm sure he had a good chuckle. He has made the economy the top issue, yet it was nowhere on the debate ledger. None of the candidates has come up with a convincing critique or an alternative economic vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conservatives are vulnerable on abuse of power, but we are still waiting for a Liberal to unveil a real plan for the restoration of Canadian democracy. Mr. Trudeau is rolling out some ideas to cleanse the system, but it's doubtful they will amount to the overhaul that is necessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Winnipeg, one of the only pointed performances came from Deborah Coyne, who issued a strong rebuke of the government's campaign against science and research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martha Hall Findlay continues to show more spark than the other candidates. She is capable of thinking outside the box. But her big issue, a reform of the supply management system, resonates with about 2 per cent of the population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one point Mr. Garneau got it right, warning against the party being too vague. It was seen as a veiled shot at Mr. Trudeau, who, in fact, has put out as many policy positions as the others. But questioned later, Mr. Garneau declined to say if he was criticizing the front-runner. That's how hot it got in Manitoba.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe these Liberals will awaken at some point. Maybe Mr. Trudeau's arrival will be all that is needed to return them to contender status. But at this point they are a comatose lot, reduced to trotting out the same kind of mush that saw them get trounced in the 2011 election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one point during the Winnipeg proceedings, Mr. Trudeau said he sensed that Canadians are getting “excited that we might be doing politics differently.” You had to wonder whom he was trying to kid.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our unhealthy obsession with home ownership is never more clearly seen than it is in a well-used federal government program called the Home Buyers' Plan.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The HBP allows first-time homebuyers to withdraw up to $25,000 from a registered retirement savings plan to help cover a down payment. Somehow, we've decided that houses come before retirement savings. That's a mistake and it needs to be corrected by winding down the HBP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prepare for hysteria if this is ever seriously discussed by the federal government. “There'd be a deafening outcry from the real estate industry, mortgage industry, first-time buyers, and many politicians,” Robert McLister, editor of the Canadian Mortgage Trends blog (canadianmortgagetrends.typepad.com) and a mortgage planner, told me in an e-mail. “First-timers have already taken the brunt of recent rule changes, so canning the HBP would be viewed as war against young homeowners.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is true, and here's why. The idea that everyone should own a house is a foundational and uncontested financial principle here in this country. The massive rise in house prices since the mid-1980s has convinced almost everyone that there's not only a social and economic benefit in promoting home ownership, but also a financial one for owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're buying in some cities at current prices, that latter point is debatable. But let's leave this alone and focus only on the misalignment of financial resources encouraged by the HBP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine a young couple, both 30 years of age and both with $20,000 or so in their respective RRSPs. Through the HBP, these disciplined savers are converted into spenders. They remove money that could grow to roughly $96,000 in value over 40 years (assuming a 4-per-cent average annual growth rate) and turn it into a pile of bricks and lumber. Okay, a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A house is an appreciating asset, if you can commit to living there for at least 10 years or more. But houses are not cash boxes. Few people reach a point in life where they sell their house and pocket the proceeds. Typically, a lot of the money is needed to buy or rent their next place of residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RRSPs, not houses, are how you save for retirement. Tax-free savings accounts are also good for retirement, and for saving a house down payment (read my take on this online at tgam.ca/DmoR).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not like using the HBP is an outright plundering of the RRSP. You are supposed to put the money back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The default repayment plan puts you on track to repay in equal instalments over 15 years, although you can certainly speed things up. Many people do just the opposite, though. Figures from the <span class="companylink">Canada Revenue Agency</span> show that approximately 35 per cent of HBP withdrawals are not repaid each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In these cases, the required annual repayment is added back to your taxable income. The government recoups what it lost when it gave you a tax deduction for your RRSP contribution, while your RRSP gets stiffed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CRA figures show it has been used 2.6 million times as of the end of 2011, with total withdrawals in the area of $27.9-billion. The good news is that HBP use has been declining in the past few years, although this may simply reflect the declining percentage of first-time buyers in the home market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no question that eliminating the HBP would be yet another blow to the first-time buyer. Last June, the federal government reduced the maximum amortization period for mortgages with a down payment of less than 20 per cent to 25 years from 30. The longer amortization period made it easier to afford mortgage payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ending the HBP wouldn't stop young people from saving for a house, though. They can still use TFSAs, which for this year have a contribution limit of $5,500. You can also carry forward the $5,000 annual limit in place from 2009-12. You don't get a tax deduction for TFSA contributions like you do with RRSPs, but there's a lot more flexibility in terms of getting access to your money and putting it back later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TFSAs are designed to be all-purpose accounts – good for everything from safety-first emergency or home down payment funds to stock trading. RRSPs should be just for retirement, but that's not the message being sent by the availability of the Home Buyers' Plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the HBP, the federal government is telling us that buying a house is important enough to scoop down-payment money out of your retirement savings. Why is Ottawa handing out bad financial advice?</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard III, king of England, whose remains have now been discovered, is entitled to a more honourable ceremony – attended by the Queen – than the furtive burial he received after his death in the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. He should not be the object of hero-worship. Nor should the melodramatic presentations of him be accepted as fact – the Italian diplomat Polydore Vergil and Thomas More were courtiers of Richard's enemy and successor, Henry VII, and Shakespeare followed them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard succeeded his 12-year-old nephew, Edward V, who was deposed after a dubious challenge to the validity of the marriage of Edward IV, Richard's elder brother. The boy and his younger brother were moved into the Tower of London; they were never again seen in public. Richard would have been wiser to remain lord protector (or regent). At the very least, he should have taken every possible measure to assure the children's safety.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Detective stories often have the premise that the obvious suspect is not the guilty party. In 1951, The Daughter of Time, a detective novel by Josephine Tey, ingeniously applied that logic: The prime suspect, Richard, was innocent, and Henry Tudor had had the young princes killed. Many readers were thrilled by this reasoning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard was quite a good king, but not the paragon that many in the Richard III Society claim him to have been. For example, they say he created pre-trial bail; in fact the one parliament in his reign passed a bill to let justices of the peace grant bail, as well as judges. Nor did he institute the presumption of innocence. On trade, Richard brought in some protectionist import restrictions, though he did exempt printed books. Another bill, to his credit, abolished the practice of “benevolences” – oppressive extra taxes – though a little later Richard exacted forced loans. Afterwards, the avaricious Henry VII revived rapacious tax collection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On balance, Richard got off to a good start – if only he had not usurped the throne. This loss of legitimacy helped give Henry a pretext to invade from his exile in France. The Richard III Society deserves praise for its tenacity in the search for the new historical evidence, but its eulogies for their hero should be taken with several grains of salt.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebeckers, sensitive to their province's image beyond its boundaries, sometimes lament what they see as an “anti-Quebec bias” in reporting about their province. They're correct – to a point. But there are, and have been for a very long time, other writers who've taken Quebec seriously and written about it fairly.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The major English-Canadian media have always had correspondents in Quebec. Shelves groan with books written by non-francophones about the history of Quebec. Non-Quebec journalists have written biographies of prominent Quebeckers. The best journalistic account of the Parti Québécois government was penned by Graham Fraser, then a journalist and now Official Languages Commissioner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turning the mirror around, however, reveals an almost total lack of coverage and interest among Quebec writers, journalists and intellectuals about what is called the “rest of Canada.” No Quebec media outlet, except for state-subsidized <span class="companylink">Radio-Canada</span>, has a correspondent in the rest of Canada (outside Ottawa). Such indifference is deep and widespread.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is why Jean-Louis Roy's book comes as a shock and a delight. Chers voisins: Ce qu'on ne connaît pas de l'Ontario is part reportage, part analysis of Canada's largest province. The treatment is thorough, generous (almost to a fault), curious and deeply researched.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Very few Ontarians will have read as much literature by Ontario authors, plowed through more government reports about the province, spoken to so many thoughtful citizens and tried as hard as Mr. Roy to situate Ontario within contemporary Canada and the world. There's a French expression for such a book: un tour de force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chers voisins is obviously written for a Quebec audience, but the book doesn't keep comparing Quebec to Ontario. Instead, Mr. Roy treats Ontario on its own, as a fit subject for inquiry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What he finds is a province that has transformed itself into something he calls “post-multicultural.” Toronto, the focus of the book (the rest of the province is a bit far off in his intellectual distance), he discovers to be a city where ethnicities blend and meet with more harmony than almost anywhere else on the planet. Yes, he acknowledges, many new arrivals struggle, but the ascension of so many is something he finds deeply admirable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transformation of Toronto impresses him, as does the city's cultural and intellectual life (he obviously didn't spend much time at City Hall). Toronto is “une ville métisse,” its population mixture an “essential category for the current century and also a fundamental tenet of humanity: diversity.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Roy, a polymath who has been editor of Le Devoir, head of la Francophonie, Quebec's agent-general in Paris and president of Rights and Democracy in Montreal, doesn't explain whence came this curiosity about Ontario, so rarely found in his native province. But once he set about applying his intellectual curiosity to Ontario, he found a place more diverse and challenging than its vague and outdated reputation in Quebec suggests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all Mr. Roy's generosity toward Ontario, and his obvious delight in its cultural vitality and demographic diversity, he doesn't neglect the province's serious economic challenges: a beaten-up manufacturing sector, a large government deficit, reliance on a U.S. market that has flagged, and undeveloped trade relations with Asia. A tighter marriage of the province's ethnic diversity and new overseas markets is a critical pathway for Ontario's economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Roy sympathizes with those thinkers (mostly in the policy world) who believe Ontario should recapture some powers from the federal government. Perhaps he does see Canada as a country of regions. What he may have missed is that these complaints have never impressed those for whom they were intended – Ontarians – and receive no support outside the province. Nor is much of rural Ontario as ethnically diverse as its large cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario now receives equalization payments, as much a commentary on the province's decline as the nutty system of equalization. Yes, Mr. Roy argues, Ontario faces a host of economic challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ontario has what he thinks is a fine higher-education system, centres of real innovation and creativity, a population that's diverse and growing, and a vibrant cultural life. It's a place that will remain a vital player in the Canadian Confederation and North America.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Malala Yousafzai is one of the most remarkable people on the planet today. The Pakistani teenager was shot in the head by the Taliban last October because she spoke out in favour of educating girls. On Monday, she spoke on video for the first time since undergoing a series of successful operations to rebuild her skull and restore her hearing. She said she wants to continue her fight to educate “every girl, every child.” Her courage is beyond inspiring.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Malala caught the Taliban's attention in 2009 when she began writing a blog for the BBC about life in the Swat Valley, a region where Pakistani forces and the Taliban have repeatedly clashed, and where the Taliban have closed down and destroyed schools that educate girls. That led to a New York Times documentary about Malala, and she became a sought-after international spokesperson for her people's struggles against the Taliban's sadistic rule. The Taliban reacted the way they always do; they put a hit out on Malala. Two gunmen walked onto her school bus on Oct. 9, 2012, asked for her by name and fired bullets in her head and neck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they weren't able to kill her. Instead, they turned her into an even bigger international heroine. After months of surgeries, 15-year-old Malala walked through the halls of a British hospital on Monday under her own power and gave a videotaped interview. The left side of her face slightly slack as a result of her wounds, the young woman spoke with a wisdom that belies her age. She said she has been given a “second life,” a gift that has made her want to “serve the people.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I want every girl, every child to be educated,” she said in direct defiance of the terrorists who have vowed to try to kill her again. She also announced the creation of the Malala Fund, a charity that will support the education of girls everywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Young Malala's story is remarkable in many ways. She has rallied the world in the fight to educate young girls, and all children. But her greatest gift has been to demonstrate to Pakistanis, and to people watching around the world, that it is possible to stand up to the Taliban. Her courage is infectious. May a thousand Malalas bloom.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">André Simon, a prominent French-born wine importer and writer active in England during the first half of the 20th century, left behind many pearls of wisdom about his beloved beverage. I suspect a lot of people would endorse this one: “Food without wine is a corpse; wine without food is a ghost; united and well matched they are as body and soul, living partners.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Okay, okay, wine needs food, and vice versa. As a child of European immigrants, I heard the same gospel growing up, if uttered not always so graphically. It was beyond dispute, like the inevitability of death, taxes and the Leafs blowing another season. But let's be real. Are all wines truly ghostly without grub? As I enjoy a glass of sumptuous Châteauneuf-du-Pape at the keyboard (yes, I get to drink on the job), I beg to differ.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wine, Clos du Calvaire Châteauneuf-du-Pape 2010 ($28.95 in Ontario), is rich and velvety, with heartwarming alcohol and plump fruit interwoven with nuances of licorice, smoke and cracked pepper. One could call it a meal in itself, and I want for nothing else as I savour it on this cold February eve (though roast leg of lamb would not be out of place if I were hungry for a match). If this wine is a ghost, I'm Patrick Swayze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all bottles taste this good on their own, to be sure. A tannic young Barolo or cabernet-based Bordeaux begs for food. A crisp, light Beaujolais might be fine on the summer porch but lacks the stuffing and flannel-like texture that satisfies in winter. I got to thinking about the criteria – at least my criteria – for a great non-food red for cold-weather sipping because, for some of us, the pop of a cork is not in all cases a call to the table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's not real life in North America,” says John Clerides, owner of Marquis Wine Cellars, a store in Vancouver. “We've got hockey games in background. We socialize differently than the French.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like me, Clerides is a fan of grenache, my go-to grape for couch quaffing. It's a supple, strawberry-like variety that often dominates southern French blends, such as those of Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Gigondas and Côtes du Rhône, all of which basked in near-ideal weather in 2009 and 2010, two vintages widely represented on store shelves. It also features prominently in the gutsy, value-priced wines of the neighbouring Languedoc-Roussillon region, such as Minervois and Corbières.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The grape excels in warm climates, including Spain and Australia, where lower acid levels stand in contrast to the crisper, food-clamouring fruit of cooler Northern Europe. Clerides also favours syrah, grenache's frequent blending partner, which adds a layer of peppery verve and structural support to grenache but which also shines on its own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For non-meal sipping, he recommends Domaine de l'Hortus Clos du Prieur 2010 ($30 at Marquis), a syrah-grenache Languedoc blend. “With every sip, you go, ‘I'm going to get something else.' And by the end of the day you've finished the bottle and have to have another the next day to figure it out.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wines without food demand that multidimensional quality, with flavours that unfold in waves to retain our interest. That's why I'm left cold by the ocean of corporate-crafted “cocktail” wines designed with inoffensive smoothness, and not much else, in mind. “Great wines for me have an edge, a personality,” Clerides agrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To my Southern-French list of big-personality wines, I'd add the firm, spicy Hecht &amp; Bannier Côtes du Roussillon-Villages 2010 ($23.95), another broad-shouldered grenache-led blend that includes spicy syrah and tannic mourvèdre, as well as Domaine Grand Veneur Les Champauvins Côtes du Rhône 2010 ($18.95) and the bargain-priced Les Jamelles Merlot 2011 ($12.95).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rae Holland, general manager and sommelier at Rush restaurant in Calgary, shares our affection for Southern France. Holland says her lounge area regularly buzzes in the afternoon with patrons accustomed to sharing bottles of hearty red in lieu of predinner cocktails. When asked, she might recommend Ortas Rasteau Côtes du Rhône Villages (about $20 retail) or Chateau Ollieux Romanis Cuvée Prestige Corbières from the Languedoc (about $16).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She also likes the chunky Australian rendition of the style, often labelled GSM for grenache-shiraz-mourvèdre. “I went on a kick (with those wines) a few years ago and I haven't been able to stop,” she says. “They're so rewarding.” Among her other New World favourites is Mission Hill SLC Syrah from British Columbia (about $30), with its voluptuous fruit yet tight backbone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fairness to André Simon, wines around the world are less harsh these days. A growing emphasis on full ripeness in the vineyard has tamed acidity and eliminated harsh tannins, resulting in wines that don't necessarily demand food to soften the rough edges. And many sunny growing regions and wine styles simply were off Simon's radar, if they existed at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the case with ripasso, a suitable Hockey Night in Canada quaff for the beer-averse crowd. Essentially a concentrated version of crisp-and-cheerful valpolicella, it retains valpolicella's lively acidity while adding raisiny opulence and earthy complexity. “I get people coming in and asking for them now,” Holland says. “They offer more structure than most fruit-juice bombs.” My affordable choice: Pasqua Villa Borghetti Passimento ($12.95 in Ontario).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though generalizations are hazardous with wine styles (quality varies significantly from producer to producer) my list includes such value propositions as Chilean merlot, Portuguese reds from the Douro, Dao and Alentejo regions, nero d'Avola from Sicily and, when grown on cooler, well-drained hillsides, Argentine malbec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Obladee Wine Bar in Halifax, co-owner Heather Rankin clearly knows how to pick her malbecs. She's currently featuring Trapiche Broquel from Argentina ($7.50 a glass and about $15 to $18 retail around the country). “It's such a great little wine,” she says. I agree, though by “little” she means price, because the Broquel is one rich, creamy, mocha-charged Hummer of a red. She is considering adding another of my reasonably priced Argentine favourites to the mix, Catena Malbec ($20 to $23 retail).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Portugal, Caves Alianca Dao is another popular choice on her list ($11.99 retail in Nova Scotia), while I'd recommend Tinto da Anfora 2010, another Portuguese red that's a big bargain at $11.95 in Ontario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Just because a wine is not a, quote-unquote, ‘food wine' doesn't mean it can't be interesting,” Rankin says. It need not be a ghost either.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get a glimpse of the future of Vancouver's residential land squeeze, take a look at what is unfolding in the Norquay Village neighbourhood, where city planners are keen to rezone single-family properties.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To supporters, the mass rezoning will be a prudent way to encourage developers to construct row houses and townhouses in a city where land values have soared. Creating more housing options for families is the goal. The rezoning in Norquay on the city's east side is intended to spur multiunit projects on single-family lots. After all, living in high-rise condos on busy main roads may be fine for many couples or those who are single, but families need better and lower-priced choices for ownership on quieter streets, city planners say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For commuters driving along six lanes of traffic on the southern stretch of Kingsway Avenue, it would be easy to blink and miss Norquay. The city adopted the name Norquay Village for the area in 2005, though long-time residents still think of their neighbourhood's heart as Renfrew-Collingwood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area is home to the Mandarin immersion program at John Norquay Elementary School on Slocan Street. Landmarks along Kingsway include Purdy's chocolate factory, Harvey's furniture store, Beefway butcher shop, McGavin's bread outlet and the historic 2400 Motel. The sprawling motel site, owned by the City of Vancouver, is targeted in the long term for two towers – one proposed for 12 storeys and the other 16 – in a residential and commercial development. Less than a kilometre away at 2711 Kingsway, the Skyway Tower condo project is under construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for now, the buzz in Norquay is over the impact of rezoning on side streets. If developers end up assembling adjacent lots, watch for a new era of higher-density living on residential streets. City planners are seeking to spark multifamily housing developments, noting that mass rezoning will save developers roughly six months of cutting through red tape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's really about adding to the diversity of the housing stock in the city to meet the diversity of the housing needs of its citizens, whether it's people already here and want to stay here or people who want to move here,” said Matt Shillito, assistant director of planning for the City of Vancouver. “We hope that it might be applicable in other suitable locations in the city. That doesn't mean that all the single-family parts of the city would change, but areas close to shopping, services, transit and community facilities are logical places to put these new housing types.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Constructing more dwellings within a limited space is the name of the game in Vancouver, so spare a thought for the vanishing patches of grass on single-family lots. Some residents such as Rita Achtemichuk say the City of Vancouver has a vested interest in increasing density to boost its tax base. Critics say Norquay's rezoning is designed to entice builders to buy older homes, most of which still have large lawns. It isn't easy protecting greenery amid urban pressures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The planned rezoning is not a tweak. It is a revolution,” said Joseph Jones, a community activist and blogger. “Why should the geographic heart of East Vancouver be subjected to housing density which is currently unacceptable elsewhere in Vancouver?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City planners, however, are supporting the development of row houses and stacked townhouses. The key requirement is for a builder to assemble at least two single-family lots that are located side-by-side, and then go through the process of a development permit application. This new category for row houses and townhouses will be called RM-7 zoning. The row houses will have the added benefit of property ownership, compared with strata title on townhouses. The townhouses will have elements that will appeal to families, notably individual entrances instead of the common lobby found in high-rise condos or mid-rise apartment buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another rezoning proposal, duplexes will be allowed to have secondary suites. In some cases, where there are two or three single-family lots with a small home on each property, multiple dwellings are envisaged on the combined lots. There are various permutations in this new category called RT-11, including duplexes with laneway houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next up could be rezoning of single-family neighbourhoods elsewhere in Vancouver, said Lewis Villegas, an urban design consultant. But he urges city planners to take a closer look at their proposal for Norquay because row houses will work in some cases but spoil the quaint flavour of streetscapes in others.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first glance, the NDP's bill on Quebec secession looks like a sensible compromise. For the federal government to start negotiations after a Yes vote, the question must be “clear” – something the Parti Québécois never dared do in its two referendums – but it maintains the “50 per cent plus one” threshold for a “victory” vote.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This last rule, although it's highly questionable (the NDP itself requires a two-thirds majority to change its constitution!), was accepted by all of the players involved in the Quebec referendums of 1980 and 1995, including the federalist leaders. Even Pierre Trudeau, the arch-defender of Canadian unity, never raised a formal objection to 50 per cent plus one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One could add, after all, that the Liberals' Clarity Act – which calls for both a “clear question” and a “clear majority” – is not a sacred trust and that the NDP has every right to devise a position of its own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pundits were quick to see this move as an electoral pitch to Quebec, which has become the new base of the NDP now that 60 per cent of its parliamentary caucus comes from that province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The irony of the NDP's position is that a majority of Quebeckers were actually in favour of the Clarity Act at the time it was passed by Parliament, and there's no reason to believe their opinion has changed since then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly after the adoption of the Clarity Act in 2000, a survey supervised by Maurice Pinard, the veteran <span class="companylink">McGill University</span> sociologist who's among Canada's most respected pollsters, showed that 60 per cent of Quebeckers, including 53 per cent of sovereigntists, were “strongly” or “somewhat” in favour of the legislation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year earlier, an extensive CROP survey had tested the principles stated by the Supreme Court decision that would form the basis of the Clarity Act – with the result that 72 per cent of francophone Quebeckers wanted a majority of at least 60 per cent in favour of sovereignty. This survey, it's worth noting, was done with an exceptionally large sample of 4,992 respondents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sovereigntist leaders used the most inflammatory rhetoric to condemn the Clarity Act – a “Soviet-like law,” for example, that was “a crime against history.” But they didn't dare organize a public demonstration against it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's more. In the federal election held months after the adoption of the Clarity Act, the Chrétien government increased its standing in Quebec by nearly a dozen seats and won 44.2 per cent of the Quebec vote (against 39.9 per cent for the Bloc Québécois, which had campaigned against the law). The crushing victory of the Chrétien Liberals in Quebec was one of the reasons then-premier Lucien Bouchard resigned from politics in early 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obviously, the NDP chose to ignore these facts and carelessly took for granted that the chattering classes, which were by and large against the law on the grounds that it countered Quebec's right to self-determination, were representative of the province's public opinion. It was not the case, and for good reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is indeed a matter of common sense that a sizable majority should be required when it comes to abandoning Canadian citizenship and that it would be unfathomable to break up a country on a judiciary recount. Actually, the sovereigntist leaders were the first to admit (generally in private, though) that, if the result of the 1995 referendum had been reversed, with a razor-thin majority for the Yes side, it would have sent the province into chaos – and made for a very dangerous situation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's a statistical curiosity that – if it continues – is going to have a real impact on the final standings of a shortened 48-game NHL season.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the first 127 games played this season through Monday, 30 went to overtime and 18 were decided by shootouts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's roughly in line with the historical average. But what's different is how the vast majority of the “loser” points – 21 as compared to nine – were “earned” by teams playing in Western Conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NHL changed a lot of things about the business of hockey in the last round of collective bargaining negotiations, but the bizarre practice of awarding three points for some games and two points for others was never broached.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It meant that in the first 17 days of the season, there were 12 additional points awarded in the Western Conference, which is going to make it even harder for the early bottom feeders to make up ground as the season moves along. After all, there is no interconference play this year – and the divide between West and East is particularly acute when it comes to shootouts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 18 games decided by shootouts in the NHL so far, only three have occurred in the East. Meanwhile, in the Western Conference, the <span class="companylink">Nashville Predators</span> have been involved in a league-high five shootout games, while the <span class="companylink">Vancouver Canucks</span> have played in four and the <span class="companylink">Chicago Blackhawks</span> and <span class="companylink">San Jose Sharks</span> three apiece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Blackhawks</span> have had three consecutive games decided in shootouts heading into Tuesday night's first-place showdown with the Sharks, losing two and then winning the third last Saturday, when Patrick Kane scored against Miikka Kiprusoff in a 3-2 victory over the <span class="companylink">Calgary Flames</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Kane, the <span class="companylink">Blackhawks</span> did something different before the Calgary game that may have contributed to a better result.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's funny,” Kane said, “because we lost the first two shootouts and didn't do any film. Then, before our regular meeting [last Saturday], we called in seven, eight guys and watched the last 10 shootout attempts on Kiprusoff.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Did it help? It probably didn't hurt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prescouting goalies – and putting some real thought into the shootout – represents a significant shift from the 2005-06 season, when the shootout was first introduced and teams took a casual, almost cavalier approach to it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shootout may still be a gimmick to some, but since it doesn't appear to be going away any time soon, NHL teams are finally treating it as a part of the game, something they need to practise in the same way they practise breakouts or penalty killing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You're right about that,” <span class="companylink">Blackhawks</span> head coach Joel Quenneville said. “I just think we're playing 48 games. The juggling for positioning and the value of the points is tremendous. We know it's going to have implications at the end.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quenneville is fortunate to have two excellent shootout specialists at his disposal: Kane and team captain Jonathan Toews, who once memorably scored three consecutive shootout goals in a world junior championship game, using three different moves. Kane is 11th all-time in NHL shootout goals, with 24, while Toews is 13th, with 23.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Detroit Red Wings</span> forward Pavel Datsyuk leads with 31, but the player with the best percentage is <span class="companylink">New York Islanders</span> centre Frans Neilson, at 60.5 per cent (23-for-38).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Variety is the key to shootout success, Kane says. One of his signature moves is to skate in on the goaltender, virtually coast to a halt, try to get him to commit one way or the other and then find the opening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kane missed using that “slowdown” move against Canucks goalie Roberto Luongo the night before, so mindful of the fact Kiprusoff might be looking for it, took a different tack 24 hours later and came barrelling in fast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I just tried to switch it up,” Kane said. “We've been in three straight shootouts. I missed the first two times. One of them, I tried the slowdown move. Usually, I go second and watch what Johnny [Toews] does and kinda see how the goalie reacts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I saw Kiprusoff poke-check on Johnny, so I thought I'd be able to pull it to the backhand and go five hole. Luckily, it went in.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Quenneville, the <span class="companylink">Blackhawks</span> practised the shootout almost every day in training camp and now whenever they can squeeze in a practice in the shortened season. He believes you can instruct the players all you want, but in the end, they need to make a split-second decision in the moment – relying on their instincts, and their abilities to read what the goaltender is giving them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strangely enough, it took almost seven years for that awareness to fully sink in across the NHL. Now, teams get it. The shootout is a fact of life, so you better take advantage when the opportunity arises. For some team somewhere, it'll likely be the difference between making or missing the playoffs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One recent evening, all aglow on a tincture of dry sherry, I sat down at the computer to research the landscape of what is known as pilot season. And I am still recovering.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the glorious time of the year when broadcasters and studios cast an eye over all the ideas and proposals that have been put forth by legions of writers and producers, and decide to spend money on the making of a pilot episode for a possible new series. It is a time of great hope, and, in many cases, hilarity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this neck of the woods, there is already excitement – at least in certain pockets of hoity-toity Toronna – about the news that Conrad Black, the famous bellicosity-denier, will have a chat show on <span class="companylink">ZoomerMedia</span>'s Vision TV. But where to schedule it on Vision? Before or after Absolutely Fabulous, for a crackerjack prime time of demented entertainment? Could Vision organize a crossover episode with Downton Abbey? One can see Black chewing the cud with Dowager Countess Violet Crawley (Maggie Smith), and hence the excitement in certain circles, no doubt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the U.S. networks that garner the attention, though. And boggle the mind. All that money, all those holes in the schedule to fill. Honestly, one looks over the list of potential shows and wonders if somebody is pulling your leg. Having a laugh. Get this, the synopsis for the possible ABC comedy Bad Company: “A slightly self-centered female boss at a high-end luxury goods department store finds her ways challenged when the boss's son comes to town and makes youth and sex the new company focus.” Hello? Only “slightly” self-centered? Dear heavens, the nuance. Call me crazy but “totally self-centered” sounds better and funnier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The usual concepts are floated, of course. Maverick cops run amok. Maverick surgeons. Maverick lawyers. Somewhere on the list of dozens of pilots I expected to find one about a maverick maître d' with unusual management solutions for restaurants, bars and hotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I didn't. What I did find, while in search of a theme, were the names Robin Williams, Eddie Murphy and James Caan. It has come to this – in desperate need of new shows and star power, a bunch of old-timers are being brought back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Williams is in a pilot for CBS called Crazy Ones, described as a “single-camera workplace comedy that revolves around a father-daughter relationship at home and at work.” And this is actually good news. Williams is funny in any circumstances, and given the dearth of good comedy these days, he is welcome to come back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Eddie Murphy, the project is a puzzler. CBS is looking at a series that will act as a sequel to the movie Beverly Hills Cop. It comes from Shawn Ryan (The Shield) and is described as, “a continuation of the iconic Beverly Hills Cop universe as Axel Foley's blue-collar police-officer son, Aaron, helps take down the criminal elements of the rich and famous, while simultaneously trying to escape the shadow of his larger-than-life father.” Apparently, Murphy will appear in the pilot and will be a recurring character if the series is picked up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard to believe that with all the talent available and all the permutations on the cop genre that are possible, CBS is regurgitating the Beverly Hills Cop premise. I mean, the “maverick cop” thing is understandable, but a maverick cop from decades ago?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Caan, who has appeared, mostly, in dramas (Las Vegas, Magic City), is in a comedy pilot. It has no title yet, but the gist is this: “The multi-generational family comedy, from 20th Century Fox TV, centres on Terry Gannon, a recently divorced single mother who temporarily moves in with her estranged father (Caan), a beer-swilling former baseball player. She reluctantly starts coaching her son Tommy's underdog Little League team and is drawn back into the world of sports she vowed to leave behind.” Oh dear, oh dear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking at the pilot list, it is, is fact, difficult to figure out which ones to highlight for the absurdity of the synopsis. But try Killer Women, from ABC: “It's hard to fit in when you're the only woman in the notoriously male <span class="companylink">Texas Rangers</span>, but that doesn't stop Molly Parker – our ballsy, beautiful badass who knows how to get to the truth and isn't afraid to ruffle a few feathers on her way there. Based on the Argentine series Mujeres Asesinas.” I regret to inform Canada that the show is about a character named Molly Parker, not the distinguished Canadian thespian Molly Parker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I could go on, but I won't. I'm no longer aglow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airing tonight</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (CBS, CTV, 9 p.m.) is a crossover with CSI: NY. The latter's Mac Taylor (Gary Sinise) goes to Vegas and helps as D.B. Russell (Ted Danson) looks into the case of a body found inside a wine barrel. Perhaps a maverick maître d' is on the loose?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is an astonishing list of the accomplished that Austria has given the world.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Composers such as Mozart, Strauss, Schubert, Haydn. Bankers like the Rothschilds. Mendel, the geneticist. The poet Rilke, Klimt the great artist, Otto Preminger the acclaimed film director, Thomas Vanek the leading scorer in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Again?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, an Austrian is the leading scorer in the game Canada invented and America sells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a remarkable story: a 29-year-old Austrian running away with the scoring race in the early going, his 19 points entering the <span class="companylink">Buffalo Sabres</span>' Tuesday night game against the <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span> three points in front of Tampa Bay's Steven Stamkos, six ahead of Pittsburgh's Sidney Crosby and seven in front of last year's Art Ross Trophy winner, Penguins forward Evgeni Malkin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a lot of luck,” Vanek says. “Let's be honest. There's going to be times when you have the same games and end up with zero.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not lately, not when playing on a line with 30-year-old Jason Pominville of Repentigny, Que.,and 22-year-old Cody Hodgson of tiny Haliburton, Ont.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In this game,” says the quiet Austrian, “you can't do anything on your own. It's a cliché but it's true. You've got to have good linemates.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vanek and Pominville played well as a pair last year but lacked the sort of centre who could do his own hard digging and cash in on the often-surprising passes that come from the two slick wingers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm just trying to fit in,” Hodgson says. “They do a great job getting pucks to me. I just try to complement them.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We found the right middle,” Vanek says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They've got great chemistry,” says Buffalo head coach Lindy Ruff. “They just seem to know where each other's at right now.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ruff says that people should hardly be as surprised by Vanek's rise as they often seem to be. This is his eighth season in the league and he has never scored less than 25 goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He's always sort of seemed underrated,” Ruff says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He's just got an intensity about him,” says Hodgson of his high-scoring linemate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Dangerous every time he touches the puck,” adds Ruff. “He's dynamic. He's as dangerous as any player in this league.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vanek was born in Vienna and played his minor hockey in Austria. His father had moved there from Czechoslovakia and began a professional hockey career that took the family to several different centres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 14, showing enormous promise as a player, young Vanek moved to the United States and played high-school and junior hockey in Sioux Falls, S.D., and then college hockey for the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers, where he led them to the <span class="companylink">National Collegiate Athletic Association</span> championship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2003, Vanek was the fifth-overall draft pick when Buffalo selected him in the amateur draft. A year later, he was playing for Austria in the world championships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(In an intriguing twist, he was wooed by Slovakia, as his mother comes from there. Had Vanek's scoring touch been available to the Slovaks in the 2010 Vancouver Winter Games, Canada might not be the defending Olympic champions. He chose Austria, his birthplace, and has remained loyal ever since, even returning to play in the country during the 2012 lockout.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>, Vanek's skills and strength – and remarkable ability to tip shots into nets – were quickly noticed. He had a tremendous season in 2006-07 when he scored 43 goals and had the top plus-minus (plus-47) in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>. The <span class="companylink">Edmonton Oilers</span> came after him as his contract in Buffalo ran out, signing him to a seven-year, $50-million (all currency U.S.) offer sheet that the outraged Sabres felt they had to match, having already lost star forwards Daniel Brière and Chris Drury to free agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With his first season paying a stunning $10-million – and the current season coming in at $6.4-million – Vanek's play has been closely scrutinized, and often criticized, by fans, especially when his scoring slipped badly in the first year of the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that was then and this is now. He rides at the top of <span class="companylink">NHL</span> scoring and, barring injuries, should remain at or near the top for the shortened season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where his <span class="companylink">Buffalo Sabres</span> end up is another matter. They came into this game against the <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span> with an unimpressive 3-5-1 record and decided to start backup goaltender Jhonas Enroth, who was unimpressive in a 4-3 loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senators scored easily on him – Erik Karlsson, Chris Phillips, Daniel Alfredsson and Chris Neil – while the Sabres could only mount a third-period comeback that came up just short on goals by Tyler Ennis, Jordan Leopold and Pominville.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vanek, for once, could not supply his usual goal a game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The tough part,” he says, “is that the team is not doing as well as I would like.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's fun being the top scorer – but not much fun getting scored on so often.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, emotions remained raw from the 1995 referendum and the painfully thin margin between the Yes and No sides. Many felt helpless to save Canada and looked to the federal government to do something – and hoped federal legislation clarifying the process would be an insurance policy against future referendums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the new law failed to provide clarity and became yet another flash point in the ongoing constitutional debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let me be clear: I am a federalist and a Quebecker. I campaigned on the No side in 1980 and 1995. And Thomas Mulcair was there with us in the trenches, fighting for Canadian unity and passionately making the case then – as he does now – for Canada, in Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While I dearly hope we don't face another referendum, I know that no simple act of Parliament can prevent the people of Quebec from seeking independence, if they so choose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its ruling on the Quebec Secession Reference, the Supreme Court underlined a key political fact: In the event a provincial government receives a mandate to seek constitutional change, up to and including secession, the other participants in Confederation would be obliged to come to the negotiating table. In plain language: This is a political problem, requiring a political solution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fast forward to this past week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craig Scott is a constitutional expert and NDP MP for the same riding the late Jack Layton represented. In 2011, Mr. Layton became the first federalist leader in more than two decades to win a majority of seats in Quebec. As the New Democrats' newly appointed democratic reform critic, Mr. Scott started drafting legislation that put into law what the Supreme Court had already told us – if a province has a legitimate mandate, the rest of Confederation must sit down to negotiate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A central point in this debate, of course, has been around how one determines when the citizens of a province really have expressed a majority will to secede. This issue was brought to the forefront because of the complex and unclear wording in the two previous referendums, especially the 1995 question. Any Clarity Act worthy of its name must solve this problem – but the law we have now failed to clarify anything. The only way to solve this problem is through a clear, unambiguous question – agreed on by both sides. This is now accepted practice elsewhere, including the coming Scottish referendum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With an ambiguous question, there is reason for asking whether the vote is a clear expression of voters casting their ballots for independence. And ambiguity leads to a messy process where outsiders must step in and decide, after the fact, what level of vote is required. The current act is a recipe for endless wrangling. This is why it was seen as insulting and paternalist by the vast majority of Quebeckers – and why all parties in the National Assembly opposed the current Clarity Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with a clear question, 50 per cent plus one becomes the unambiguous and democratic expression of the electorate. As the Supreme Court made clear, if we agree that Canada must be held together by motivating its people to stay together, and not by force, then there is no other path.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So how do we so motivate them? For one thing, we pass clear laws that avoid the kind of arbitrary after-the-fact shifting of the goalposts that has been met with such anger by Quebeckers. Independentists in Quebec have few effective battle horses left, which is why they're trying to exploit this issue, as we see with the Bloc Québécois motion in the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a federalist, my message to all Canadians who want this country to stay together is simple: Let's not help the Bloc by perpetuating the confusions of the Clarity Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is why I believe that rewriting this act to add clarity is helpful to the cause of unity. But Mr. Scott and the NDP go further with their bill: In an innovation that has been mostly overlooked by the media so far, the bill also draws a road map for Quebeckers to seek constitutional change within Confederation. This addition is important and puts into law the commitment Mr. Layton made during the last election: creating the winning conditions for Canada in Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To their credit, the New Democrats chose not to hide from the issue. Nor did they try to use the unity debate to score partisan points, as parties such as the Bloc – which have little left to offer – routinely do. The NDP will rightly vote down the Bloc bill to repeal clarity, which would have left us with a legal void.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Mr. Scott and the NDP chose a constructive and positive approach that I believe brings us closer to eventual constitutional peace in Canada. For that principled act, Mr. Mulcair, Mr. Scott and the NDP's caucus should be applauded.</p>

Fifty-four countries, including Canada, helped. No region of the world stayed aloof. Twenty-five countries in Europe, 14 in Asia and 13 in Africa helped. Australia helped. And that worldwide help undermined the international norm against torture, says a new report by a non-profit group based in New York, the Open Justice Society Initiative.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, Globalizing Torture, shows that when push came to shove, the West's prohibitions against torture were sometimes treated as so much flotsam. In the realpolitik of the era, countries lent airspace and refuelling stops for <span class="companylink">CIA</span> planes – Canada did that, too – let the <span class="companylink">CIA</span> run jails on their territory and looked the other way as people disappeared. Sometimes those people turned up in Egypt or Syria and were tortured. Sometimes, as in the case of Ibn al-Sheikh al-Libi, they gave out false information. The current U.S. film Zero Dark Thirty has people asking whether torture may have helped lead to the killing of Osama bin Laden. It's worth remembering that Mr. al-Libi, under Egyptian torture, falsely linked Iraq to chemical-weapons trade with al-Qaeda. Colin Powell cited this information at <span class="companylink">the United Nations</span> as a justification for the Iraq war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is the only country that has apologized to an individual caught up in the U.S. practice of extraordinary rendition (the extralegal transfer of suspects between countries), the report says. Maher Arar of Ottawa was shipped off to Syrian torture by the U.S. after Canada wrongly labelled him a suspected terrorist. A 21/2-year judicial inquiry followed, providing Canada with a national soul-searching. We were right to beat ourselves up. It's disconcerting to find we were the only ones who did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Open Justice Society Initiative is a program of the Open Society Foundations, a charity started by the investor George Soros to help formerly Communist countries embrace the rule of law. It urges the U.S. and other countries to “own up” to what they did. The information will come out sooner or later, the report says, because court challenges are under way against officials in the United Kingdom, Italy, Poland, Lithuania, Romania and others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada publicly repudiated its actions in the Maher Arar affair, but it seems unlikely others will follow, unless they are forced to. The result is that it is more difficult for the West to make the argument that torture is wrong.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alex Gough made peace with the Whistler Sliding Centre before her bronze medal at the recent world championships. One of the tiniest, big stories on the international winter sports scene, the 5-foot-7 Canadian luger (and one of just two non-German sliders to be on a World Cup podium this season) has conquered her past and is now focused on the future: the 2014 Sochi Olympics.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gough and the rest of the Canadian team will be in Lake Placid, N.Y., this weekend for the penultimate race of the World Cup season, which will wrap up in Sochi. It is one year to the Winter Games and Gough is in fifth place, behind three Germans and Russia's Tatiana Ivanova, the lone non-German to win a women's singles race (in Sigulda, Latvia) this season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gough has been targeted for stardom since the run-up to the 2010 Vancouver Games by a sport whose governing body is desperately seeking fresh, new faces to grow it beyond its usual borders and temper its traditional and, at times, stuffy German hegemony. (Some <span class="companylink">International Luge Federation</span> officials would like to see her lose her lip-ring.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Calgary native could only manage an 18th-place finish in Whistler, B.C., admitting she lost focus after the FIL decided to use lower starting gates after the on-track death of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So much for the home-track advantage that had been built up by a massive volume of runs for the shy bookworm, who was an honours student at the National Sports School in Calgary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Having a couple of years since then to think about it, it was obviously super disappointing and devastating. And when we came back to race a year later, I don't think I'd left it behind or even really dealt with it,” said Gough, 25, who posted third-place finishes in the first two World Cup races this season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I've gained a lot of maturity since then.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I know I can't worry about things like decisions the governing body makes. I learned a lot about myself,” Gough said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian head coach Wolfgang Staudinger, the former German Olympian whose work in turning Canada's luge program into a world leader is one of the most underchronicled spin-offs of the Own the Podium program, knows the German program inside and out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's equipment is on a par with the Germans, he says – and that's no small feat considering the millions of dollars spent on technology for Germany's luge, skeleton and bobsleigh teams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Gough is, in the coach's words, “the one slider capable of breaking into the wolf pack” at the top, led by Natalie Geisenberger, a photogenic six-foot blonde from Staudinger's Bavarian hometown of Berchtesgaden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For her part, Gough believes it will ultimately be her ability to find more power in her starts that will put her on the podium consistently. “There's still some time hidden in the start for me,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada should be well-placed for medals at the Sochi Games, where the track will emphasize technical skills as opposed to speed. For the first time, luge relay is a medal sport and because it involves a gated start and touchpads as opposed to a simple pull, extension, push and paddle start, Canada's traditionally explosive starters have found success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Gough? Staudinger agrees she was simply not mature enough to handle the “overnight change,” at Vancouver three years ago. The Germans complained about being forced to start lower down on the track, saying it turned the track into a “kinder” or kids' track. But they laid down medal-winning times while the Canadians floundered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is a world power in bobsleigh and luge is on a similar path, which is significant since the battle for 2014 overall medal supremacy could very well be decided in the sliding sports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You want the next Jon Montgomery (the Canadian skeleton racer who grabbed gold in 2010)? It could be Gough.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathleen Wynne's desire to put some distance between herself and Dalton McGuinty is beginning to take shape, in the form of an Ontario Premier's office almost unrecognizable from the one she inherited.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virtually every senior staffer who served under Mr. McGuinty is on his or her way out. In their place will be a new team expected to be headed by Tom Teahen as chief of staff and Andrew Bevan as principal secretary, neither of whom have experience at the centre of provincial power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But more than just new faces – none of which have yet been made official, with Mr. Teahen and Mr. Bevan both declining to comment on Wednesday – it appears Ms. Wynne will be placing a very different structure around herself, aimed at making good on her promise of a more collegial manner of governing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Breaking from the comparatively rigid corporate model favoured during Mr. McGuinty's aborted third term, she will return the office to a more flexible one seen to better suit a rookie premier during uncertain times, and to fit the accessible persona she is seeking to project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The approach, in which the two top staffers answer directly to the premier, is one Mr. McGuinty used himself before shifting away from it. It places the chief of staff predominantly in charge of personnel and administration, while the principal secretary takes the lead on policy development and communications. But it allows for a degree of overlap, and requires those and other officials to build fluid working relationships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As they try to develop a sense of teamwork, the new officials might be united by the close relationships most of them already enjoy with Ms. Wynne. Mr. Teahen, most recently an executive at the <span class="companylink">Workplace Safety Insurance Board</span>, ran Ms. Wynne's office when she was education minister. And Mr. Bevan, chief of staff to Stéphane Dion during his time as federal Liberal leader, ran Ms. Wynne's campaign when she first got elected as an MPP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Allison, likely to take on an operational role within the Premier's office, ran her leadership campaign. Shelley Potter, also expected to take a senior job, was her most recent ministerial chief of staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some of them have not previously worked with each other. And while there don't appear to be any huge egos in the group, this type of structure always runs the risk of quarrelling and confusion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By most accounts, it worked fairly effectively during Mr. McGuinty's first term, at the time when the more political chief of staff, Don Guy, and the more policy-focused principal secretary, Gerald Butts, effectively counterbalanced each other. But as the personalities changed, the lack of a firm structure led to turf battles – senior officials at various points competing with each other, advisers outside the government occasionally calling the shots, confusion among more junior staffers in the Premier's and ministers' offices about whom they reported to, and politics seemingly trumping policy with increasing frequency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he took over as chief of staff in Mr. McGuinty's final term, David Livingston responded to a perceived lack of accountability by drawing on his Bay Street experience. Four deputy chiefs were appointed with clear sets of responsibilities, all of them reporting to Mr. Livingston. While some insiders credited it with establishing clearer lines of responsibility, others believed the place became too rigid and a bit tone-deaf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any event, it wasn't enough to allow Mr. McGuinty to navigate his way out of a very tough year. And his successor appears to have decided she needs to get back to something much more nimble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the personalities, Ms. Wynne will be hoping they can get along not just with each other, but also improve relations between her office and the rest of government. Mr. Teahen and Mr. Bevan, both of whom have reputations for being easy to get along with, likely will be watched closely by cabinet members and senior bureaucrats who have complained in recent years of too much command-and-control from the centre.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this week, citizens of Vancouver awoke to a stunning bit of front-page news – their city had won the Olympics all over again. Or at least that's what landing the annual TED conference was being likened to by excitable tourism officials when it wasn't being trumpeted as the Holy Grail of conventions.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No doubt, countless British Columbians were wondering what all the fuss was about. For many, “TED” conjures up images of a low-brow comedy starring Mark Wahlberg and a teddy bear. Little did they know it's an acronym for technology, entertainment and design and, in fact, a high-brow conference for invitation-only elites who gather to hear “world-changing ideas” delivered in slick 18-minute presentations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson was over the moon at the news. The fact that this cultural forum was coming to his city was another sign of its world-class cred, he boasted. What he didn't say was that TED imagines the kind of better planet embodied in the utopian dream his Vision Vancouver party has for the city, one that's devoid of cars and oil tankers and whose economy is bolstered by wealthy software engineers who get to work on their bicycles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Nathan Heller, writing in The New Yorker last year, said of the makeup of the typical TED crowd: “It's the mood of professionals who wear Converse to work, own multimillion-dollar homes at 32, eat local, donate profits to charity, learn Mandarin and rock climb the Pinnacles on Sundays.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A TED conference costs a minimum of $7,500 to attend. Those hoping to grace the halls of the convention go through a vetting process that includes writing an essay on why they should get a lucky delegate spot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TED was founded in 1984 by American architect Richard Saul Wurman as a modest annual chinwag for thinkers and brainiacs of disparate backgrounds interested in talking about how technology and innovation was changing the world. Chris Anderson assumed control in 2001 and, soon afterward, it exploded into a global intellectual phenomenon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, millions have lapped up the highly polished populist lectures on topics that are often arcane in nature but, nonetheless, designed to have a powerful impact on the audience. This exposure has helped expand the TED brand and spawn mini-conferences around the world under the organization's imprimatur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, TED – whose credo is Ideas Worth Spreading – enjoyed mostly fawning treatment from the popular press. Lately, however, the organization has been the recipient of some withering critiques. It has been skewered for lectures that are formulaic in design, that emphasize style over substance and that come across as little more than crass sales pitches for whatever book the presenter happens to be flogging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alex Pareene, writing in Salon.com, said the standard TED talk is modelled on a recipe popularized by author Malcolm Gladwell. Common tropes, he suggested, include oversimplified explanations of complex problems, idealistic solutions to said dilemmas, unconventional explanations for origins of identified vexing issues and “staggeringly obvious observations presented as mind-blowing new insights.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most devastating review of what TED has become was penned by a former conference presenter, Evgeny Morozov. Writing in The New Republic, he said TED was no longer a curator of ideas worth spreading but, instead, something quite menacing. “Today TED is an insatiable kingpin of international meme laundering – a place where ideas, regardless of their quality, go to seek celebrity, to live in the form of videos, tweets, and now e-books. In the world of TED … books become talks, talks become memes, memes become projects, projects become talks, talks become books – and so it goes ad infinitum in the sizzling Stakhanovite cycle of memetics, until any shade of depth or nuance disappears into the virtual void.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this is not to say TED doesn't have something to offer. Many of the lectures – including one by Sir Ken Robinson on how schools are killing creativity – are terrific. TED has helped bring complex thoughts and theories to the masses and produced something more enlightening to do on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> than watch uncomfortable testimonials and mashups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But enthusiasm for TED needs to be tempered with the reality that, while it may be a special conference to host, it can also be a fountain of new-agey, mumbo-jumbo futurism that promises far more than it delivers.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Federal Court ruling last week that upheld the notion that employers should try to accommodate the child-raising needs of employees is a welcome decision. It should by no means displace the right of management to exercise its own reasonable flexibility in scheduling, as circumstances change. But the demands created by having children are legitimate needs, too – not merely the result of a lifestyle choice.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fiona Johnstone was a customs inspector for the Canada Border Services Agency at Pearson International Airport just outside Toronto. Before she gave birth to a child in 2004, she had a full-time job with irregular, unpredictable shifts. Her husband had a similar job at the CBSA, with rotating shifts, though with heavier responsibilities. Before she returned from maternity leave, she asked for “static” shifts, that is, for a schedule that would allow to plan for child-care arrangements that would include family members. The CBSA responded by offering her only a part-time job with fixed shifts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She then made a complaint to the <span class="companylink">Canadian Human Rights Tribunal</span>, which decided in her favour in 2010; the CBSA appealed to the Federal Court, which upheld the tribunal's decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was quite an extreme case in which management overreached, insisting on a constantly changing schedule. The vital, normal balancing of interests was lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Johnstone was found to have suffered discrimination on the grounds of family status, and so she had. To speak in more vernacular language, however, there is a great difference between personal choice, in such matters as the selection of a style of clothes, and family obligations, including the taking on of such obligations in the first place. This is a decision deeply rooted in common sense.</p>
