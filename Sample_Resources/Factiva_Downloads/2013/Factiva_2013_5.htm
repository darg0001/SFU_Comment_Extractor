<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span> should think long and hard about changes to the law that would allow Canadians to be stripped of their citizenship if they go abroad to commit acts of terrorism, or acts of war against this country and its allies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Immigration Minister Jason Kenney floated such changes on Wednesday. The government is understandably embarrassed, as all Canadians should be, by allegations that our nationals were involved in recent terrorist acts in Algeria and Bulgaria. However, responding with knee-jerk legislation that would alter long-established rules of citizenship is a poor way to save face.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To begin with, such measures would create an invidious distinction between Canadian-born criminal citizens, who could not be stripped of citizenship, and naturalized citizens who could. There would be two classes of punishment for similar crimes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once we were headed down such a path, it might be hard to stop. What about other serious crimes committed abroad, or for that matter within Canada, by naturalized citizens? If a terrorist flunky can be stripped of citizenship, why not also a mass murderer or serial abuser of young children? Indeed, why stop there?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking away citizenship is not something that we do. It is something more often associated with countries like the Soviet Union, which stripped Alexander Solzhenitsyn of his. Canada has a very different tradition. For example, the 1,200 Canadians who went to fight in Spain during that country's civil war did not lose their citizenship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of the extreme act of revoking citizenship unevenly, there are already tools that can be used to punish those responsible for what are very serious crimes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, cutting such criminals loose from citizenship and hence from their obligations to the Crown would be to let them get away easily. It would be far better to apprehend such individuals and to try them in this country for treason, in the case of those who fight against Canada and its allies. Those who commit terrorist offences abroad could similarly be vigorously prosecuted under anti-terrorism laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terrorism is, of course, a fraught area, because of the difficulty of classification. We all likely agree that a Canadian linked to Hezbollah and alleged to have attacked a bus loaded with Israeli tourists in Bulgaria is a terrorist. But what if he had been a jihadi fighter responsible for attacking a busload of Moammar Gadhafi's cronies in Libya? The government needs to do everything it can to identify Canadians involved in fighting against Canada and its allies abroad, and those involved in terrorism. It needs to find ways to thwart them, possibly including refusal to issue passports. If such crimes are committed, those responsible should be apprehended and vigorously prosecuted. The government already has the tools. Use them.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Janice MacKinnon teaches her course in public policy at the University of Saskatchewan, she likes to tell the story about the elderly Ontario woman who fell in the lobby of a hospital and broke her hip. (The woman had been visiting her dying husband.) Hospital staff told her that, unfortunately, they couldn't help her until she called an ambulance to take her to the emergency room.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story captures what's wrong with health care in Canada – bureaucratization, rigidity in attitudes and work rules, lack of common sense. Ms. MacKinnon, a former NDP finance minister in Saskatchewan, has loads of common sense. She also has a few ideas for improving health care. Here's one: Let private clinics, not hospitals, perform routine surgeries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This idea is so controversial in Liberal-ruled Ontario that it's not even on the radar. Public-sector unions and academics denounce it as the first step on the slippery slope to dismantling medicare. Yet, it's working well in the cradle of medicare itself – Saskatchewan. “They've kept it very low profile,” Ms. MacKinnon tells me. “They've been selling it as a solution to waiting lists.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Saskatchewan Surgical Initiative began in 2010 as a response to long wait times for surgeries. Today, the province contracts out a growing number of procedures to private clinics. The unions (and some doctors) warned that the clinics would cost more because profits would be “siphoned off.” They wanted the government to expand the public system, instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's what happened under the new system: Wait times plunged. Safety and quality improved. Overall costs for the contracted-out procedures declined by 28 per cent. The cost for some procedures was cut in half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How is this possible? “The clinics are very focused and they only do a small number of procedures,” Ms. MacKinnon says. “They're small and easy to manage, and they're not unionized.” By contrast, hospitals are large, complex, inflexible bureaucracies with several different unions. “You need a huge administrative capacity just to handle the union contracts and the grievance process.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patients prefer the private clinics, too. They're more convenient, and offer better service. It's also easier to park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But wait. What would Tommy Douglas think?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You know, he ran a very efficient government,” Ms. MacKinnon says. “He believed in sound public services delivered efficiently. And that's what the unions are missing. Their alternative was that we would pay more for the staffing of the facility and the public would have fewer and slower services.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. MacKinnon, a cabinet minister in Saskatchewan during the 1990s, is in the Tommy Douglas mould. She was the first finance minister in that period to balance the budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The real problem is that health-care costs are squeezing out education and social services, which have important influences on health,” she says. “Tommy would not have tolerated that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor would he have tolerated the generational inequity that has become a central feature of the system. As it's now structured, the children and grandchildren of the baby boomers will pay a large share of the boomers' health-care costs. According to one study cited by Ms. MacKinnon, Canadians born between 1958 and 1967 will consume over $4,000 more in health-care services than they'll pay in health-care taxes. But people born between 1998 and 2007 will pay over $18,000 more in health-care taxes than they'll take out. And people born after 1988 will wind up paying peak taxes that are twice as high as what the boomers paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not fair, Ms. MacKinnon says. “You can't have a society built on the youngest members being stressed to the point where they lose hope.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her answer: Change the income tax system, so some of the health-care costs are borne by those who use it. She explains her reasoning in a new report, Health Care Reform from the Cradle of Medicare, published by the Macdonald-Laurier Institute. Some will say her ideas are heresy, but I think they're common sense. As she puts it, “We can best honour the spirit and legacy of Tommy Douglas by reform.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good Canadian Kiefer Sutherland returns to TV on Friday in the rebooted Touch (Friday, Fox, Global, 8 p.m.). It's one of those maddening shows that can suck you in and yet mystify you.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launched last year as a mid-season drama, Touch had just two main characters: Martin Bohm (Sutherland) a widower, and his young son, Jake (David Mazouz). Jake doesn't speak. He's a special kid. Ultra-special, actually, and valuable to some nefarious no-goodniks who want to use his special powers. Jake sees patterns in everything, and the patterns unlock vital secrets. Exactly what those secrets are, remains part of the mystery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a voiceover, Jake describes the world as “a giant mosaic of patterns and ratios.” And he says, “Mathematical in design, these patterns are hidden in plain sight. … Only some of us can see how the pieces fit together.” Jake hates to be touched and spends his days writing down patterns of numbers. In the first batch of episodes, Martin helped Jake use those patterns to do some good in the world – to help people who were lost, connect people who needed each other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the new episodes (starting with a two-hour premiere on Friday), the action has shifted from New York City to Los Angeles. Martin has a sidekick, of sorts, in a mother, Lucy (Maria Bello), whose daughter has the same gift as Jake and who has gone missing. It appears that some shadowy tech company has kidnapped her. So the show turns into a thriller, with Martin chasing down the company's bad guys while searching for the woman's daughter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's odd to find that Sutherland is back in Jack Bauer mode of 24, almost. Minutes into Friday's first hour, he's tackled a bad guy and is attempting to get into the tech company offices to find its secrets with the help from an investigative website run by a former Los Angeles Times reporter. All that is missing is Chloe from 24, barking instructions into his ear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in Brussels, an assassin is searching for a composer who created a beautiful piece of music and then stopped composing. It becomes clear that the composer is, like Jake and the missing Amelia, one of the mystically gifted people. Exactly why he should be assassinated is a tad unclear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is fascinating to see a show rebooted so radically. In its original incarnation, Touch was mushy-mystical, deeply reverent about Jake's special powers and his ability to help others. Now it's a conspiracy thriller, with many scenes of violence, much suspense and a permanent mood of anxiety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Series creator Tim Kring, who also dreamed up Heroes, has shifted this series closer to the style and tone of his previous hit, celebrating the wisdom and gifts of the young but stationing them in a world that teems with adult killers. The role of the young is to save the world from adult horror.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It doesn't quite work, but Touch is a better show than it was – less dorky and more focused on entertaining viewers with suspense and mystery. A good deal depends on Sutherland, who has an ability to play both tough and tender. Mind you, Bello seems underused and spends too much time merely hanging around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, as Touch returns, Sutherland will receive his Man of the Year award from <span class="companylink">Harvard University</span>'s Hasty Pudding Theatricals. The award goes to “performers who have made a lasting and impressive contribution to entertainment.” Sutherland has certainly done that, but Touch isn't a cornerstone of that contribution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airing tonight</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wind Rush (CBC, 9 p.m. on Doc Zone) is essential viewing for anyone interested in the debate about wind turbines. It looks at the controversy in Southern Ontario, where there have been many complaints about the effects of such tur-bines – chronic sleeplessness, resulting concerns that the debilitating symptoms can lead to diabetes, depression and heart disease, and complaints too of inner-ear problems. The doc contrasts the turbine situation in southwestern Alberta with that of Southern Ontario and also looks at the situation in Denmark where, we're told, people have soured on wind power. By the way, if you want a double dose of hot-button environment issues, tonight's Nature of Things (CBC, 8 p.m.) tackles the fracking issue. Seems CBC wants us to be worrywarts tonight.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the old Shwedagon pagoda, there stands the tall whitewashed tomb of Queen Supayalat, immortalized by Rudyard Kipling in his lines about a beautiful “Burma girl” whose “name was Supi-yaw-lat – jes' the same as Theebaw's Queen.” On one side of “Her Late Majesty, Chief Queen Suphayalatt,” I find a memorial to U Thant, the former United Nations secretary-general; on the other, that to ambassador Khin Kyi, widow of this country's independence hero, General Aung San. One day, there will be a monument to their even more formidable daughter, Aung San Suu Kyi, who, by then, probably will be a former president, and is already treated like a queen.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, we need to remind ourselves she isn't yet president. Not for her Czech playwright Vaclav Havel's magical three-month ascent from persecuted dissident to the president's castle. Instead, there are three years of complex struggle ahead before Ms. Suu Kyi may, at 70, become head of state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As important, these years of transition, until parliamentary elections in 2015, followed by the indirect election of a president, will be decisive for the future of this impoverished, traumatized and divided country. So much needs to be done in three interlocking areas: politics, peace and the people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The politics are intricate. Most international coverage has focused on the relationship between President Thein Sein, a decent if dull man genuinely concerned about his poor county, and the uncrowned queen. One is told of a pivotal moment in August of 2011 when Ms. Suu Kyi was invited to the President's private quarters in the surreal new capital of Naypyidaw and welcomed especially warmly by his wife. But as important is her working relationship with the parliamentary speaker, Shwe Mann, another former general with political ambitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, there has to be a proper election law, electoral register and the conditions for a fair campaign. Ms. Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy has to win a landslide victory among the country's ethnic Burman majority. (Bet on that.) They should prepare themselves well for government. (Don't be so sure of that.) They also have to forge alliances with parties from the large swathes of this Southeast Asian Yugoslavia inhabited by ethnic minorities. Then, despite a 25-per-cent appointed military bloc in parliament, they must get the more than 75 per cent parliamentary vote required to remove the constitutional bar on someone with close foreign relatives – i.e., her – becoming president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although some Burmese observers remain skeptical, I would place a large bet that, one way or another, this will happen. But, of course, it involves her doing real politics, rather than remaining a moral heroine or becoming a British-style constitutional monarch. She herself makes no bones about this. At the unprecedented literary festival that brought me to Rangoon, she talked eloquently about novels and poetry, but said that almost every moment of her life is now spent on politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's vital, however, that peace be achieved as soon as possible. To do so, Burma must be Yugoslavia in reverse. Yugoslavia was a multiethnic state that fell apart in politically orchestrated interethnic violence precisely at the moment of a very imperfect transition to democracy. Burma, officially Myanmar, is a multiethnic state in which many ethnic minority areas have already experienced decades of armed conflict. If these issues are not resolved before the 2015 elections, with a degree of federalism that itself would require constitutional change, then voters might be polarized, late-Yugoslav-style, along ethno-religious chauvinist lines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last, but really first, are the people. When I last travelled here, in 2000, before being blacklisted from the country, the place was strewn with the military regime's Orwellian propaganda posters bearing slogans such as “People's Desire.” But the truth is that the military and its cronies have realized their own desires at the expense of their people's for decades. Their lavish villas contrast obscenely with the hovels of the majority of the population, who still struggle to subsist as farmers. And Myanmar has slipped to 149th on <span class="companylink">the UN</span> Human Development Index, with an average of just four years of schooling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news is that many well-intentioned people – Burmese returning from long spells abroad, former political prisoners, NGO activists and foreign donors – are working with the current government, as well as with the National League for Democracy, to ensure that transparency, accountability and the rule of law are put in place right now. Otherwise, Orwellian dictatorship will morph into entrenched crony capitalism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the criticisms to be made of Ms. Suu Kyi – for example, her apparently tactical reticence on ethno-religious violence between Buddhist Rakhine and Muslim Rohingyas – there's no doubt her global charisma and tireless engagement contribute to the scale and quality of this support. That's another reason she must be, will be, Burma's new queen – sorry, president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So there it is: The fairy tale is over, but the happy ending has yet to begin. There are three years of tough politics ahead. This will not be neat or clean; such transitions never are. But with help from friends, Myanmar still has a historic chance of ending up a far better place than it has ever been.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financial world is trying oh so hard to turn the page on paper.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest example is the <span class="companylink">Canada Revenue Agency</span>'s decision not to mail the T1 general tax package this year to people who prefer to file on paper. You'll have to obtain a tax form on your own if you reject the very convenient and sensible option of using computers and the Internet to file your taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Producing and processing paper documents is way more expensive than handling electronic documents. That's why banks are trying hard to kill passbooks and deliver your account and credit card statements online. Brokers are doing the same for account statements, trade confirmation slips and prospectuses. In one of the meaner examples of paper avoidance, some utilities have started applying a surcharge to customers who want to receive bills in paper form rather than online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CRA says it mailed 3.6 million T1 packages to individual taxpayers last year. There are a few good arguments why the decision not to mail forms this year is completely defensible. For one thing, forms for the 2012 tax year will be available for pickup at Canada Post and <span class="companylink">Service Canada</span> outlets, and by calling 1-800-959-8281. Second, CRA says it costs roughly four times more money to process a paper tax return than it does for one filed electronically. File electronically and help reduce the federal deficit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also a wide variety of tax software products available to do your taxes, and cost isn't an issue because free returns are more available than ever before. A software firm called SimpleTax (simpletax.ca) has decided to work on a “pay what you want basis” for online returns, and there's also a long-standing free downloadable product called StudioTax (studiotax.com). Other tax software products may waive costs for people with incomes of $30,000 or less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worried about privacy? The real risk isn't with tax software, it's with the government itself. That's what we've learned from a couple of recent cases in which portable hard drives containing personal information related to federal government programs have been lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CRA reports that 1.3 million paper tax packages went unused last year. Someone obviously goofed in projecting demand, and a whole bunch of trees have paid the price. But long term, there's been a very definite trend of people chucking the paper return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1990 tax year was the last where all returns were filed on paper. The market share for paper fell below half in 2006 and in 2011 it was 37.6 per cent. Three CRA programs have competed against paper – Efile for tax preparers, Netfile for individuals and Telefile, a phone-based service for individuals that has been axed after a decline in usage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If only paper will do for you in completing your tax return, then one of your remaining options is to download the necessary documents directly from the CRA website. “The difficulty is that when you get into the tax package for your province, you have to know which items you need to download,” said Cleo Hamel, senior tax analyst at <span class="companylink">H&amp;R Block Canada</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paper-only types can also buy tax software from the likes of <span class="companylink">H&amp;R Block</span>, UFile or <span class="companylink">Intuit</span>'s uber-popular TurboTax lineup, print their completed return and mail it to CRA. Ms. Hamel said all the calculations are done for you by the software, so errors are much reduced. Also, you may come across relevant tax credits and deductions you didn't know about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying tax software packages either in stores or online makes sense if you're going to do multiple returns. <span class="companylink">H&amp;R Block</span>'s product costs $29.99 and lets you do up to 16 returns. The basic and standard versions of TurboTax cost $19.99 and $39.99, respectively, and offer eight returns, while UFile's standard edition costs $19.99 and offers eight returns. These products work best when you use Netfile to submit your tax return electronically over the Internet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one or two returns, the best value is in completing your return online and using Netfile. CRA is still updating its list of Netfile-certified tax websites at netfile.gc.ca, but you can ultimately expect to find more than a dozen options for Windows and Mac-based computers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New for the 2012 tax year is SimpleTax , which is waiting on CRA Netfile certification. Jonathan Suter, one of the founders at SimpleTax, said offering no-charge returns is an attempt to address what he considers the No. 1 reason for not using tax software – cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is something we hope will get people's attention and maybe even shape the industry,” Mr. Suter said. “People are going to be filing online in the future. That's where things are headed.”</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smith may have declared in 1975, in her famous recasting of Van Morrison's Gloria, that “Jesus died for somebody's sins/Not mine.” But lapsed Catholic though the 66-year-old may be, the sensibility on display here – and Camera Solo is nothing if not an exhibition of sensibility – is so profoundly religious that the viewer is transfigured into a sort of supplicant, the AGO into a sanctuary and the memorabilia and photos – spectral black-and-white silver gelatin prints, 8.5 cm by 10.8, that Smith first shot as Polaroids – into relics imbued with the legendary poet/musician's own veneration. It's clear that over her peripatetic 40-year career, Smith has travelled as much as pilgrim as touring musician. And if art galleries truly are the new churches of our secular age, then the Smith show, overseen by Sophie Hackett, the AGO's assistant curator of photography, is nothing less than a feat of reconsecration – a point most forcefully driven home by the three suites of five images on the south wall of the main exhibition space, each arranged like the Christian cross.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when notions of “beauty” and “the hero” are if not thoroughly discredited then severely bruised, it's something of a shock to come across a show that so unabashedly and worshipfully subscribes to them as virtues. Allen Ginsberg proclaimed more than a half-century ago: “Everything is holy! Everybody is holy! Everywhere is holy!” And damned if that catholic embrace, the eminence of the immanent, informs all aspects of Camera Solo – from the displays of the cup that Smith gave her father to mark the centennial of Dickens' death, to a large rock the artist plucked from the shores of the River Ouse where Virginia Woolf drowned in 1941, to the embroidered slippers of Pope Benedict XV, to photographs of Hermann Hesse's typewriter, Walt Whitman's tomb, the headstone of William Blake, the spoon and fork used by Arthur Rimbaud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Images and mementos of Rimbaud, in fact, along with those of Smith's former co-vivant/soulmate, the late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, loom large in the exhibition. Indeed, the largest artifact in what is otherwise an intimate show is a full-scale reconstruction of the litter that carried a gangrenous Rimbaud up and down the mountains of Ethiopia in the late 1980s. Smith commissioned the replica in 2009 and inscribed some of the doomed poet's last words on one of its shafts. At the AGO the dark litter is like a bier or Charon's boat to the underworld, shrouded in netting and mounted on a large white plinth near the centre of the main exhibition space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Rimbaud, Mapplethorpe gets his own vitrine here and it includes a cross the photographer owned, a mixed-media totem to Rolling Stones' founder Brian Jones made by Smith and Mapplethorpe in 1969 in the Chelsea Hotel and old photo-booth shots, among other artifacts. It's Mapplethorpe, in fact, who provides Camera Solo's sexiest moment – a small photograph he took of Smith in her 20s, the artist crouching on a stool, in high heels, legs bared, calves flexed, staring forthrightly into his lens. Lent by two Toronto collectors, Patti Smith (with Thunderbolt Tattoo) delivers a heady hit of eros in a show otherwise heavy on thanatos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An iteration of Patti Smith: Camera Solo was first mounted in fall 2011 at the <span class="companylink">Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art</span> in Hartford, Conn., then moved to the <span class="companylink">Detroit Institute of Art</span> last spring. The AGO's Hackett didn't see either of those exhibitions but did meet with Smith last August in New York to discuss her ideas for the AGO presentation. Since then they've had “a long-distance collaboration but a really wonderful collaboration nevertheless,” notes Hackett. Smith will, in fact, see what has been wrought March 7 when she performs two evening shows of song and poetry at the AGO.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The artist likely will be pleased. Unlike the Hartford show, which “had groups of photographs organized according to types – here are writers, here are family pictures, here's where she went to Scotland,” Hackett's show has the pictures hung chronologically, although not slavishly so. As a result, there's “a sense of walking into her world,” of connections being made among art, life, enthusiasms, living family and dead friends. It's a modest show but rich in its austere elegance, the photographs and mementos potent emblems of the unceasing intensity of Patti Smith.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dwane Casey followed through on his threat Wednesday night. He played Andrea Bargnani – and the Air Canada Centre roof didn't fall in. Bargnani heard more boos than cheers when he came in after missing 26 games with an injury, the <span class="companylink">Toronto Raptors</span> committed six fourth-quarter turnovers and lost 99-95 to the <span class="companylink">Boston Celtics</span> but the good news is unless Il Mago picked up another injury, general manager Bryan Colangelo should be on the telephone this morning.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operation Arrivederci Andrea should now begin in earnest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It matters not if Bargnani shows he can play well with his new teammates; if he shows he can be more of a facilitator and less of a roadblock as he was in 23 minutes 51 seconds of his first game back, when he had 11 of his points in 9:46 in the first half before running out of gas. We have seen these false springs before – last year, in fact, when everybody was raving about how Bargnani had bought into Casey's system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Bargnani was never the same after a strained calf and seemed to shrink this season when the team started 4-18. Bargnani tore a right elbow ligament and the Raptors went 13-13 without him and became Rudy Gay's team. So do not let Bargnani break your hearts any more Toronto. Do not fall into that trap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Casey was miffed that fans booed Bargnani – “I'm disappointed, because this young man did nothing to deserve it,” he said – but he could not have been surprised. Bargnani is poison for this team and in this city; he's keeping the spot warm for Dion Phaneuf or Colby Rasmus or whomever is the next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Hey, you couldn't wait another day?” Celtics coach Doc Rivers asked Bargnani as the player waited by the timekeeper's bench to enter the game in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well no, Doc. Not with the trade deadline on Feb. 21.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of Casey's pregame musings about the game would dictate how much Bargnani played and how he wanted to “make sure it does not get us out of rhythm,” the whole plan now is to show the NBA that he's healthy. Casey was speaking to the NBA when he told reporters about how Bargnani's quiet nature could be easily mistaken for not caring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is a lot going on upstairs,” Casey said, referring to Bargnani's mind but also, it is to be hoped, to Colangelo's office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's credit Bargnani for his performance: he went roughly four minutes without getting a shot when he entered the game at the 7:40 mark of the first quarter to a mix of cheers and boos – the latter lingering three heartbeats longer than the cheers – but he contributed in other ways, flicking a pass to Amir Johnson for a layup and getting out to the line to block a shot from Jeff Green.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gay, who admittedly went a cold 1-for-9 in a messy fourth quarter, gives the Raptors a player of whom the NBA's reputation-aware officials must take note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm sure he will get the ‘star' calls,” said Casey, whose team had 10 trips to the charity stripe before the Celtics had their first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not all because of Gay, but considering the way the Raptors have been screwed over by NBA zebras this season, it is worth noting. Think back to the Raptors' 98-97 loss to the <span class="companylink">Charlotte Bobcats</span> on Nov. 21 when Bargnani, who had 25 points, was fouled by the <span class="companylink">Bobcats</span>' Michael Kidd-Gilchrist on a jump shot. No call was made and the NBA was forced to publicly apologize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The message? A six-year veteran with 25 points, has such a soft reputation he can't get a call on a game-deciding play. Better to give the minutes to Jonas Valanciunas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we're not buying whatever Il Mago sells in these next two weeks; but it's to be hoped that at least one of Colangelo's peers is not like-minded.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I kid around a lot in my advice column, “Damage Control,” which appears in these pages, but I take the responsibility of it seriously. I'm not hubristic enough to think everyone takes my advice, but what if they did and it blew up in their face?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So sometimes, when someone's written in with a particularly thorny problem, I've followed up later to ask: Did you take my advice, and if so, how did it work out for you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week was a new one for me, though. I found myself face-to-face with the person about whom advice was asked, rather than the advice seeker: a woman named Kai'enne, from a completely different culture, who challenged my assumptions about that culture, and who I have a funny feeling I will bear in mind every time I think of a joke or dispense advice in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's an occupational hazard of being an advice columnist: We know so little about the people we dispense advice to. Meeting Kai'enne helped me remember these are real, complex people who are sometimes profoundly affected by the stuff I hammer out in my tiny garage office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But let's back up for a second. Last week, a woman wrote in to say that a neighbour of hers had started walking her girlfriend down the street on a leash. Her four-year-old daughter asked about it, and the mom told her one lady was pretending to be a dog, the other lady her owner. But she felt eventually her daughter would want more info, and she didn't relish the thought of having to explain S&amp;M (or as Kai'enne would later correct me, D/s, standing for “dominance/submission”) practices to her young child. Should she maybe confront Leash Lady (my nickname, not hers), and ask her to confine this leash-walking to after 9 p.m.?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I gave my answer, prefaced with a few more jokes: “Maybe go up to Leash Lady, and, asking her permission first, scratch her behind the ears, and offer her a treat.” The more serious part of the advice being: Don't confront. There's too much confrontation in the public sphere as it is. Why not approach in a friendly way and try to get to know them? Then decide how to proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The column provoked a tsunami of reaction: hundreds of comments on The Globe's website and online forums, radio hosts weighing in. A lot of it was harsh and judgmental – to the point where Leash Lady herself, aka Kai'enne Tyrmerik, finally came forward on The Globe's site to say: “I am she,” in an effort to refute some of the more contentious comments, and illuminate, a bit, her point of view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a first – and a unique opportunity, I felt, to a) find out how it might feel to be drawn into this sort of media maelstrom, and b) shade in some of the nuances and complexities of a knotty situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I was curious. So I got in touch with Kai'enne and she agreed to meet for sushi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I didn't really know what to expect – but if I'm honest with myself, I assumed I'd meet a woman a bit rough around the edges – and domineering. The reality was different: a striking presence, elegantly dressed and in conversation a soulful, sensitive, funny and thoughtful person.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's funny this tempest is happening. I mean, we went out for a walk one day and wound up in The Globe and Mail,” she said. A friend forwarded her the column within hours of it appearing online, with a note: “Is this you?” She realized it was and started reading the comments. There were so many misconceptions about her and her girlfriend that she decided to speak up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I had suggested in the column that promenading with your girlfriend on a leash through the streets was a classic case of “épater la bourgeoisie,” like the poet Gerard de Nerval walking his lobster through the streets of Paris – or to put it in a more contemporary way: trying to shock the “straights.” Kai'enne told me that's not it at all. “We don't do it to shock people,” she said. “It's just the way we live our lives.” She said she was called “shameless” a lot by online commenters – but asks: “Why is that an insult? Why should I feel shame?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She says she fully understands that people immediately think about sex when they see her walking her “sub” (she's the “domme”), whom she also calls her “pet,” on a leash – but that part of it is purely platonic, like other couples holding hands in public. She assures me their relationship is a loving and consensual one, that her girlfriend had the leash when they met but had never found anyone willing to use it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing I did get right? Her sub “loves being scratched behind the ears.” She enjoys being treated like a pet, Kai'enne explains (one thing I got wrong: “She's not actually my dog, she's my cat – well, kitten, really”), and people have come up and patted her. But it's best to check with Kai'enne first. In fact, when it comes to this particular arrangement, there are numerous protocols, well known within what Kai'enne calls “the kink community,” that straights (my word, not hers) may not be aware of. In most situations, “I speak for her,” she says. If you wish to speak to her, etiquette dictates you ask Kai'enne first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In her view, the mom who wrote in to me had explained the situation perfectly to her daughter. It really is just role-playing, she says – and itself quite child-like. “We've turned our lives into a game,” she says. “We like to have fun. Why aren't people allowed to have fun as soon as they turn 20?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it's funny, as she speaks it all seems, well, kind of … normal to me. Or at least understandable. Madame de Stael said: “To understand all is to forgive all,” and while I've never really been fully sold on that saying, it's true a little understanding goes a long way to eliminate hostility, prejudice – so much of which is based, let's face it, on fear of the unknown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Kai'enne getting caught up in this was stressful at first, they both wound up “thrilled,” because it's helped shine a light on a subculture not too many know about or understand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her landlady told her a neighbour had come over with a bottle of wine, but Kai'enne was out. An olive branch! I told her that makes me happy, too. “Maybe put in your article that she should try again, with the bottle of wine,” Kai'enne shyly says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Damage Control will return</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australia, Canada's cousin, has got climate-change policy right. Canada, predictably, has got it wrong.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are two countries with huge geographies, forbidding climates, vast distances, abundant fossil fuels and small populations. Climate-change skeptics and scoffers abound in both countries. Down Under, they're now in retreat; in Canada, they're part of the government and prominent in certain media outlets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of July 1 last year, Australia enacted a carbon tax of $23 a tonne that will become a cap-and-trade system in three years. It will be integrated with the European carbon. Half the tax revenues will be returned to homeowners, 40 per cent to business and 10 per cent for investments in clean technology and for assistance to emitting industries that are exposed to possible job losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a range of other measures in the package, including a Department of Climate Change and a Melbourne-based Climate Change Authority. The initial overall target for reductions is a modest 5 per cent by 2020; but if other countries (see China and India, among others) act faster, the target can rise as high at 20 per cent. (The Harper government target is 17 per cent, but no serious outside analysis, including by the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development and the now-defunct <span class="companylink">National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy</span>, suggests it will be met.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics, of course, said the sky would fall. Industries would flee; consumers would revolt; unemployment would skyrocket. China would eat Australia's lunch. Wrong on all counts. The Australian economy remains among the strongest in the world, posting better numbers than Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Howard, an Australian prime minister who befriended Stephen Harper and who's coming to Ottawa next month to speak at a gathering of conservatives, spent a decade in office (1996-2007) doing next to nothing about the challenge. His defeat unplugged the path to action, but that path was not a straight line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Action on climate change split Australia. Debates contributed to internal leadership changes in the country's two major parties, caused an upsurge in support for the Green Party, and inflamed farmers and business leaders. Even under Mr. Howard, however, public opinion was shifting. Drought, floods and wildfires graphically illustrated that the continent's climate was changing. So much so that, this year, tarmac roads melted in South Australia, and fires ripped through Tasmania. The country's weather bureau added new colours to the map for temperatures above 50 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An election has been called for Sept. 14, and the climate-change policies of the Labor Party and the Greens who support it are likely to feature quite prominently. Opposition Leader Tony Abbott has pledged to dismantle the entire policy, which would be like unscrambling an omelette.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Abbott, like the Harper Conservatives, says a carbon tax is a “big new tax on everything.” His alternative, at least to date, would be ludicrously ineffective: Plant more trees, manage soil better and invest government money in new technologies. A tax would export jobs overseas, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cement, aluminum, coal, mining, petroleum – the biggest emitters – fought against the tax and would presumably breathe sighs of relief if it were revoked, even though they're receiving adjustment money. Other sectors, including high technology and finance, favour the new policy, as do most of the country's economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australia has changed radically in the past three decades, opening itself to Asia, deregulating major sectors of its economy and introducing (after Canada) a goods and services tax. Now, with this carbon tax, the country has taken a brave step toward changing incentives within Australia and contributing to the international struggle to curtail emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's quite a change from the initial Kyoto talks (when Australia negotiated laughably inadequate targets) and the Howard years of inaction. Come September, we'll see whether the voters choose to remain on the new path.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A final note of comparison and irony: In Australia, a Labor government is using a central free-market tool, a carbon tax, to attack emissions. In Canada, a Conservative government that spouts free-market rhetoric is using the least economically effective tool possible, regulations imposed by government.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trinity Western University, a private, Christian school in Langley, B.C., is seeking to open a law school. The school requires that all students and faculty sign a pledge to abstain from “sexual intimacy that violates the sacredness of marriage between a man and a woman.” The pledge is footnoted with a quotation from the New Testament that inveighs against homosexual sex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This covenant is not simply an expression of belief or a request for certain behaviour. It is in effect a bar to gay and lesbian students who are married.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Religious institutions have a long history of involvement in higher education in Canada (Queen's and McGill are two universities with religious roots), and religious freedom deserves protection. But a law school that purports to be a homosexual-free zone is a contradiction in terms. Even the school's non-discrimination policy leaves out sexual orientation. Equality before the law is at the heart of Canadian law, and a law school that won't accept that idea has no legitimacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is not an attack on religious freedom. Religious institutions such as Trinity Western (operated by the Evangelical Free Church of Canada, and attended by students from a variety of denominations) have the freedom to write, think and teach what they want. But the training of lawyers is something that the broader society needs to insist be untainted by discrimination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar case arose more than a decade ago, when Trinity Western sought to operate on its own a teachers college that it had already been running jointly with Simon Fraser University. The British Columbia College of Teachers rejected the application, but the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span> said there was no evidence that the teachers it produced would discriminate. It said that in balancing religious and equality rights, the “proper place to draw the line is generally between belief and conduct.” But isn't the school's decision to bar married gay students a type of conduct?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The issue of a Trinity Western law school is not about whether its graduates would discriminate against gay people. It's about the presence on the Canadian landscape of a law school with an effective bar to married gay faculty and students. A law school fundamentally at odds with Canadian law cannot stand.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years ago, while researching a story on dowry deaths – one of those phrases that, along with caste, is peculiar to India – I met Gurbaksh Kaur Basra, who runs a refuge in New Delhi for women who have fled violent husbands and in-laws demanding more dowry.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frail and white-haired, the 75-year-old was the epitome of stoicism until she began recounting how her own daughter had been set alight by her husband 24 years earlier. “The case is still in the courts,” said Ms. Basra. “With my arthritis, it's hard for me to attend the hearings, but I always go. My worst fear is that I will die before getting justice for my daughter.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family of the Delhi gang rape victim are “lucky” in that they will avoid Ms. Basra's fate. Given the publicity the case attracted – their 23-year-old daughter was savagely raped in a moving bus on Dec. 16 in the Indian capital and later died of her injuries – it's being heard in a special “fast track” court, which began its proceedings on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Had this court not been set up, the family would have endured the torment of waiting between 10 and 30 years for a verdict. That's what millions of Indians seeking justice have to face, because the judicial system is clogged up with 25 million cases crawling their way through the courts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Children grow up while their parents wait to hear which one of them will get custody, siblings fighting over inheritances die before getting a ruling, men and women can't remarry for years because their divorce has not come through, and parents such as Ms. Basra go to their graves without getting justice for their murdered children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, the High Court in New Delhi said it was so behind in its work that it could take up to 466 years to clear the backlog. A 2002 parliamentary report looking into judicial delays cited cases that went back to the 1950s. “It's a completely collapsed system,” lawyer Prashant Bushan said recently. “This country only lives under the illusion that there is a judicial system.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India's legal system needs a complete overhaul – it simply can't deliver justice. One reason for the staggering delays is a lack of judges. The country, with 1.2 billion people, has 15 judges for every million people, compared with roughly 50 judges per million in the United States. Moreover, at any given time, about 25 per cent of these posts are vacant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason is that India's legal procedures allow inordinate delays. Files can take an eternity to move from one person to another, and litigants are permitted to ask for endless adjournments and appeals. Lawyers love it because it bumps up their costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worst affected are the poor, who can't afford long trials and inflated legal costs – which is why most poor Indians don't even bother to register a crime unless it's very serious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An alarming corollary of these delays is that the law fails to deter criminals. Knowing you can be out on bail and lead a normal life while a case meanders for decades is almost an incitement to commit a crime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The death of the gang-rape victim galvanized the nation into reflecting on the position of Indian women. If this trial can trigger a wholesale reform of the legal system – by showing Indians that the delivery of justice can be measured in months, not decades – then the girl's death will leave a lasting legacy that will benefit millions of Indians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, so far, no one in the political establishment has shown any will to act on legal reform.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acelebrity who has achieved single-moniker status has hit the highest level of mass success: Sting, Shakira, Madonna, Charo – well, maybe not Charo.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyoncé long ago dropped her last name, Knowles, in favour of a singular declaration of stardom, so it was notable when she recently announced that her new year-long tour would be called “The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour.” Mr. Carter is husband Jay-Z, Shawn Carter, the superstar other half of the new African-American power couple. Forbes's list of the highest-earning musicians of 2012 put Beyoncé at No. 18, earning $40-million, and Jay-Z at No. 20, with $38-million – she's the main breadwinner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm no fan of the pointless tag “Mrs.,” but there was something excellent about watching Beyoncé push the definition of wife and mother at the Superbowl. Why can't a Mrs. wear a lacy butt-cape and a leather bodysuit while dancing with her own holograms in front of 108 million people? (Of course, if Beyoncé is the new standard for what motherhood looks like, then we are all failing.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it does seem bizarre that anyone, let alone an all-powerful entity like Beyoncé, would want to reclaim the anachronistic honorifc “Mrs.” at this stage in history. Last week was the 50th anniversary of the publication of Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique, which means that for a half century North American women have been privy to the rather basic idea that a woman whose identity is totally subsumed by her husband's is not a happy woman. Those Second Wave feminists noted that while men get to be Mr. from cradle to grave, the honorifics shift along the way for women, from Miss, to Mrs., each a public declaration not only of genitalia but marital status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms., with its simple, equalizing neutrality, is actually a 17th-century term – a variation on Mistress – revived in 1961 by American civil rights activist Sheila Michaels and adopted by Gloria Steinem for her magazine in 1971. Unlike Mrs., Ms. didn't stamp a job candidate as an unavailable mom and wife, half-committed to her work. But it wasn't until 1986 that a publication as august and honorific-loving as The New York Times approved the use of Ms. as the standard for women (unless otherwise requested), prompting Steinem to note: “Now I don't have to be Miss Steinem from Ms. Magazine.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps it's not surprising that Beyoncé is swinging toward the conventional. Despite the female empowerment rhetoric of songs like Independent Women (with Destiny's Child) and Run the World (Girls) – and her pro-sex alter ego Sasha Fierce – there's always been something ephemeral about Beyoncé. She's hugely talented, beautiful and sexy, but the whole package is such a perfect projection that it seems as unreal as her Superbowl hologram. She has had a nearly two-decade-long career without any real controversy, lip-syncing aside. Compare her to someone like vile Chris Brown, who can't go 48 hours without some moronic exhibit, or – more positively – Lady Gaga, with her emotional baggage and uncontained ideas. If life is high school, then Beyoncé is definitely the girl in the front row with her hands clasped, while Gaga is in the principal's office to discuss the flaming garbage can.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Befitting this carefully cultivated image, “Mrs. Carter” is part of a rebranding, a replacing of one set of stereotypes (sexy pop star) with another (sexy mama). After a long time guarding her privacy, Beyoncé will soon appear in an HBO documentary about herself that she directed, and she's been relatively open with the media about her one-year-old daughter (Blue Ivy is a good dancer). We all know what comes next: GOOP. Beyoncé has joined the elite club of celebrity moms, with her BFF Gwyneth Paltrow, alongside Angelina and J. Lo – massive stars whose youthful images have segued into maternal ones. It's a profitable identity shift. Beyoncé and Jay-Z are reportedly working on a baby clothing and products line (they've lost efforts to trademark their daughter's name). Children's books and recipe tips can't be far behind. The aging sex symbol becomes a domestic goddess and a lifestyle brand – a Mrs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as one-half of an African-American power couple (that other one, those close personal friends, is in the White House), Beyoncé's evolution is a different one than Paltrow's. Honorifics are a ranking system, a way of garnering the esteem not always historically accorded African-Americans: “They call me Mr. Tibbs.” Maybe this retro gesture is Beyoncé's way of injecting herself and Jay-Z into history: Mr. and Mrs. Carter in Don Draper's living room. Through the race lens, being a Mrs. is Beyoncé's most interesting, and defiant, construct yet. In the Obama age, the Carters are the new Huxtables, an African-American, middle-class – okay, obscenely wealthy – regular black family, with all the values the new role implies and the respect it commands.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The battles are under way in each of British Columbia's 85 provincial ridings to top the ballot on May 14, but there is another election campaign that should be percolating by now.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elections BC has primed its computer system and has some money stuffed under the mattress to conduct an 86th race, but so far, nobody has announced an intention to run for what might be the best job of the bunch: A seat in the Senate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It sounds like a grand gig. Base pay of $132,300, loads of perks. Minimal attendance requirements. There ought to be a lineup of prospective candidates to replace the recently retired Gerry St. Germain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the long-promised opportunity for British Columbians to nominate their next senator hasn't been formalized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a good bet that the Throne Speech on Tuesday will promise a law to allow for a Senate election. It will set out the financial limits and other details, but is unlikely to provide a date. It is almost too late to conduct the vote on May 14.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Christy Clark promised Senate reform last spring. Announcing it now may make a nice populist splash in the coming election, but the rules should have been in place by now to take advantage of the coming trip to the polls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a first step, a senatorial hopeful would likely need to collect signatures from across the province to put his or her name on the ballot. That will take time and money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign spending limits will likely be modest, making it challenging for anyone who doesn't already have a high profile to build a presence across this large and diverse province. In fact, raising funds in the current climate, when the political parties have been squeezing money from donors for months, won't be easy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the candidates were running under party banners, that would still be manageable. But the NDP, which wants to abolish the Senate, won't run anyone. And the B.C. Liberals will likely avoid it, too. The party's coalition of federal Conservatives and Liberals is already strained – why risk splitting the camps at a sensitive time?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Throne Speech amounts to the kickoff for a Senate nominee race for May 14, there will be just 13 weeks until election day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But moving it to another date would be tough to defend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elections BC favours the model used in Alberta, the first province to use a Senate election system to nominate its own candidates. Last year, Alberta held separate Senate elections just months ahead of a general provincial election. Doug Black, who topped the polls in a field of 13 candidates, was recently appointed to the Red Chamber by Prime Minister Stephen Harper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A mail-in ballot would cost roughly $10-million, and a ballot-box event on another date would run $35-million. The thrifty solution is to hold the vote in conjunction with the May general election, which would cost closer to $3-milllion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The option of holding the vote on May 14 made sense a year ago, when the Premier's parliamentary secretary, John Les, tabled a private member's bill proposing a Senate election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Les's project might have been helpful in the party's quest to win over support from the B.C. Conservatives. Senate reform is not a hot-button issue with the general public, but could appeal to reform-minded voters. But enthusiasm for his bill seemed to wither around the same time that the Liberals gained confidence that they were not facing a split in the centre-right vote. The bill died at the end of the spring session.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Ms. Clark said last May that she intends to have an interim election of some kind to allow British Columbians to nominate their next senator. “That's absolutely our intent,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not an unexpected issue that suddenly needs a quick fix. Mr. St. Germain's mandatory retirement date last fall was no surprise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The B.C. Liberals have had plenty of time to lay the groundwork for it. Perhaps the timing is deliberate, to make a nice pre-election statement for the B.C. Liberals. But rushing into a campaign that seems all but forgotten doesn't look like a well-planned tactic. Nor does ignoring the vacancy when voters are going to the polls anyway.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a moment in Yasujiro Ozu's Late Spring, a film about a young woman's decision to marry despite knowing it will leave her widowed father alone or (equally hard to accept) looking to remarry, that ranks as one of the most affecting you'll find.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naturally, as becoming this austere filmmaker – who was so famously precise he was able to tell producers exactly how long his movies would be before he made them – it's a quiet moment. Silent in fact, except for the Noh performance father and daughter are observing. Indeed, it's all in the face – Setsuko Hara's amazing face – as she sits beside her father and considers her decision.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ozu holds the camera on a two-shot of Hara and Chishu Ryu as the young woman realizes that this is the kind of shared experience she'll no longer have, that this present will become mere memory once she is wed. She cries, so quietly that no one notices. But we feel her pain, as internal and imperceptible as it is all around her, as sharply as she. With barely a sound, a world is shifting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late Spring is one of six Ozu movies screening as part of the magisterial Japanese Divas program currently running at the TIFF Cinematheque (it screens March 9), and I isolate this moment as a way of indicating just how deceptive the program's title is. For while the classical Japanese cinema – and the program spans the pre- and postwar period from the mid-1930s to the mid-sixties – is hardly comparable in its estrogenic histrionics to the big-shouldered, gun-in-garter-belt femme fatalism of contemporaneous Hollywood, it returns to the plight and status of women with even more formidably suggestive rigour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the fact that the program can contain both the virile hypermasculinity of Akira Kurosawa (whose seminal Rashomon recounts a rape from four equally unreliable points of view) and the tree-trunk stoicism of Ozu, is testament to the role played by women in an enduringly fascinating period of film history. Take the women out of classical Japanese cinema, and not even Toshiro Mifune – Kurosawa's leading man – is left with much to howl about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between the temperamental and aesthetic extremes of Ozu and Kurosawa are some of the Japanese cinema's most instrumental auteurs – Kenji Mizoguchi, Kon Ichikawa, Mikio Naruse, Hiroshi Teshigahara, Yasuzo Masumura – all of whom demonstrated a nuanced fascination with the role of gender in a society at once intensely codified, traditional, fractured and contradictory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bookends marked by these two filmmakers also set the parameters of period costume epic and intimate domestic drama. And the work of the directors in between marks the territory where history, mythology, politics, morality and postwar upheaval combine and combust. What so many of these movies depict is the falling away of masks and the flesh beneath – perhaps nowhere more instructively than with the figure of the geisha.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a figure on whom to hang a whole society's shifting traditions and sense of order, the geisha is an obvious object of interest to these filmmakers because of the way she embodies both everything that is ordered, ancient and revered in Japanese society and all that is up for grabs in the abruptly westernized <span class="companylink">Coca-Cola</span> economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If anything, the cutthroat urgency for economic recovery in the postwar-occupied country stripped the geisha of her veneer of decorum and cultural legitimacy, leaving the prostitute encountered in Mizoguchi's</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sisters of the Gion (March 14) and Street of Shame (March 21), which was actually instrumental in the changing of Japanese prostitution law, and Naruse's When a Woman Ascends the</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stairs (March 24).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The geisha, the dutiful daughter, the struggling war widow, the kept mistress and the household-anchoring wife: These are the primary female archetypes of classical Japanese cinema, and like all archetypes they became so because their outward familiarity provided an exceptionally sturdy vessel for a vast range of concerns, interpretations and perspectives. But what it all came down to, and what both these essential filmmakers and their formidable divas – Setsuko Hara, Izusu Yamada, Hideko Takamine, Ayako Wakao et al. – understood is precisely how much of a world can be reflected in a tear.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Carney's testimony to the treasury committee of the British House of Commons on Thursday was followed by a strengthening of the pound, which was up 0.24 per cent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. If this was no mere coincidence, it was not primarily an indicator of the success of the performance at Westminster of the present Governor of the Bank of Canada and future governor of the Bank of England.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather, Mr. Carney had previously given an impression that he would take the Bank of England in a more stimulative, loose-money direction, which would have tended to lower the value of the pound. His presentation to the treasury committee, however, reasserted his commitment to flexible inflation targeting of the kind he has adhered to in Canada. Consequently, the foreign-exchange markets raised their expectations for the British currency.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The emphasis of Mr. Carney's thoughts has indeed shifted, but not really its substance. In December, he gave a speech to the Toronto society of financial analysts, on the normally less than headline-making subject of “forward guidance” in financial statements. By that time, his hiring as the governor of the Bank of England had been announced. Toward the end of the speech, he managed to connect nominal GDP targeting – a technique of monetary policy – to the topic at hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He apparently intended to send up a trial balloon to be spotted far away in Britain, and the British took it as such. Nominal GDP targeting is a policy that would seek economic growth by making up for lost time in a downturn – more expansive than the “accommodative” stimulation Mr. Carney has pursued in Canada. Britain, however, has had a harder time than Canada since 2008, with two recessions (a “double-dip”); it was plausible that he might favour somewhat more radical measures in his new job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the treasury committee this week, Mr. Carney confirmed that he had wanted to raise discussion about NGDP, but he made clear his preference for continuing with flexible inflation targeting. Indeed, back in December, he pointed out NGDP's drawbacks, too. By now distancing himself explicitly from that policy, he showed his agility in the politics of central banking – and incidentally gave a small boost to the British pound.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skating on an outdoor rink is the most natural expression of Canadianness. The sound of blades, the frozen toes, throwing in sticks to pick sides for shinny, flooding the backyard in bone-shattering cold after the kids are in bed: These traditions helped make us what we are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environmental scientists now tell us that outdoor skating is under threat. A small army has come forward to defend it; they're called RinkWatchers, and they're at the forefront of what we hope will be a new golden age of citizen science in North America.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't news to anyone that the Earth is warming, that sea levels are slowly rising, that snow and ice are receding worldwide. We know these things are happening and grudgingly allow that people are to blame, but most of us don't actually see them happening. The media dutifully report scientists' warnings about shrinking glaciers, while companies sell us pop that will help save polar bears. We hear and understand the message but make no personal connection with it, living as we do in comfortable homes in places where glaciers and polar bears are, thankfully, absent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When presented with evidence of environmental change, people often ask, legitimately, “Okay, but how does this affect me?” Scientists must answer this question. And once people do see how they're affected, they then need opportunities to express themselves and interact with other like-minded people. Only then is collective action to address the challenge likely to occur. A key way of achieving this is through citizen science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North America's bird watchers have shown for decades through Christmas bird counts that engaged citizens can gather scientifically reliable data. Britain's recent Open Air Laboratories project spawned 25,000 projects involving half a million citizen scientists, documenting everything from roadside trees to backyard insects. We need a similar explosion in citizen science across Canada, and soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environmental change is speeding up, but government investment in environmental science and monitoring is slowing down. Successful adaptation to an environmentally uncertain future requires all of us to be systematically observing, reporting and analyzing the changes around us. Where better to start than our outdoor rinks?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Jan. 8, we launched RinkWatch.org with a press release, good intentions and a budget of zero. The premise is simple: If you maintain a backyard or neighbourhood rink, we ask you to pin its location on our online map, then visit the site regularly to record the days on which the rink was solid enough to skate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two days after we launched, an enthusiastic article in a Montreal paper and an interview on a Toronto morning show brought so many visitors to the website, the server crashed. By the end of January, more than 700 rinks had been registered by RinkWatchers from Yukon to Newfoundland, and from Minnesota to Massachusetts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early users of the website began asking for additional features. Some wanted to enter historical data for their rinks dating back many years. Others wanted a user forum to connect with other RinkWatchers and swap stories, photos and tips on how to improve their rinks. We fulfilled these requests with the help of five enthusiastic undergrad volunteers, and the number of RinkWatchers continues to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our aims in creating RinkWatch are threefold. First, we seek enough regular users that, after a few years, we can start tracking trends in winter weather conditions. Yes, this type of data is available from weather stations, but weather stations are few and far between, and rink data provide complementary information at very local scales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, we want to see whether this methodology can generate scientifically reliable data. Third, we see RinkWatch as a way to connect families with environmental research through something they already love doing. They may not be able to help scientists collect data about polar bears, but they can certainly report data about rinks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The enthusiasm for RinkWatch shows there's a fourth opportunity: to start a new era of citizen science. How many times have you read in this paper that Canadian kids are falling behind in math and science, that we aren't innovators, that we fail to grasp the magnitude of the challenges we face this century? It's time to look past the doom and gloom and do something about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In our daily lives, we observe many things that, were the observations pooled, would be valuable scientific resources for understanding the environment. Skating rinks are just one of many. A smartphone is a powerful data collection, analysis and communication device that makes every person carrying one a potential citizen scientist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We literally carry in our pockets and purses the power to tackle the world's environmental problems. The challenge for Canada's scientists and government policy-makers is to provide the opportunities to make it happen. The challenge for you, the reader, is to join us. After you're done flooding the rink, of course.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't expect pitching great Jack Morris to illuminate <span class="companylink">Toronto Blue Jays</span> radio listeners about which players he thinks are juicing as he watches them this season.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's not my job to judge that,” says Morris, who's replacing Alan Ashby beside Jerry Howarth. “That's baseball's job. My job is to talk baseball.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't mistake that for indifference about performance-enhancing drugs in baseball.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Players using [PEDs] is not fair, it's not right,” Morris says. “I will say that. They do it because they're weak. I lived clean in my career, because I believe that's how we should do it. It was the same in my career, guys are always looking for an edge. You have a choice, and some guys convinced themselves they needed it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the type of record that would get him first-ballot induction into the Hockey Hall of Fame, the four-time World Series champion has yet to receive a call to Cooperstown. Morris was the quintessential big-game pitcher from 1979 to his retirement in 1994. So how does he feel about the drug cheats getting into Cooperstown before him?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's been a lot of spaghetti thrown at the wall the past few years for people to sort out,” he says. “My opinion is that the writers have to sort it out. It's going to be for them to decide it. It's not easy, that's for sure.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morris says he's had offers to do full-time media work, but family concerns have not allowed them. Now, the 254-game winner says, the chance to go to a team like the Blue Jays was too good to pass up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Toronto was special for me when I played there, and I can see the same thing maybe happening this year again. Nobody wants a job where the team you cover loses 95 games a year. This has a chance to be special.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Journalists who dealt with him can attest that Morris did not suffer media fools gladly in his career. (“From now on I'm not talking,” he said after one media row. “From now on I know I won't be misquoted.”)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The five-time All-Star says that since he stopped playing, the dynamic between reporters and players has changed dramatically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Baseball has done a better job of prepping players how to handle the media,” he says. “There's not the same kind of access we used to have. They do a lot more to protect players now.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morris says he's going to have to use his access to win over the players in the Toronto clubhouse. Previously he'd work 25 to 30 games a year for the <span class="companylink">Minnesota Twins</span>, not enough exposure to players to create a bond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm going to try to let them know what I'm about,” Morris says. “Criticizing friends has always been the toughest part of the job for me. I get no joy ripping on players, but if I have to do that, I want them to know I'm not just taking shots. I've been there and know how it works.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morris's favourite players turned media guys are Jim Kaat (‘I love him, how he does it”), John Smoltz, Ron Darling and Buck Martinez. “They understand the transformation a player has to make when he joins the media, being fair but critical when you need to.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what will make the difference for this Blue Jays team over all the non-playoff squads since Morris left?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think they need a clubhouse leader, a guy who keeps them on course over the long season when stuff happens. I watched every team last year, and I'd say the difference for the Giants winning the World Series was the chemistry in the clubhouse. The Giants had it where other teams didn't.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who on the Blue Jays can be that leader?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm not going to know until I get into that clubhouse,” Morris says.</p>

On the highways, some off ramps were blocked by snow shouldered aside by the plows, leaving cars stranded. With the Eastern Seaboard getting thumped by the storm, Pearson was a mess and commuters ran into big delays on the eastbound subway in the evening rush. But, after all the plowing, driving in many parts of the city was not all that bad. Without all the careful preparation, it could have been much worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the Navy sending warships out to sea to ride out a hurricane, the <span class="companylink">Toronto Transit Commission</span> parked its subway cars in their tunnels instead of the usual open yards Thursday night, making sure they would be ready to go in the morning. It sprayed deicing chemicals on the third rail of the subway tracks where they run in the open instead of through tunnels. It ran streetcars known romantically as “storm cars” over the tracks through the night to keep the switches from freezing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the rush hour got under way Friday morning, service was, all things considered, pretty good. The worst problems came from buses getting stuck going up slippery hills. On this day, at least, the TTC really was the better way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're doing fine so far,” said Denzil Minnan-Wong, chairman of the public works committee, at mid-afternoon. “I think people are over-torqued by snowfalls of this magnitude. Twenty-eight centimetres – what's that, a foot of snow?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had a point. Even though this was the worst storm of its kind since 2008, dumping three centimetres of snow an hour at some points, then blowing it around, it was nothing like the 118 cm we got in January 1999. There was no need to call out the army this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mel Lastman's famous call to the Defence department earned us the enduring mockery of the rest of Canada. Just take a look at the hilarious mock-serious video Snow in Toronto from the Rick Mercer Report. To other Canadians, we are awful wimps, running screaming to the nearest <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> whenever we encounter a few flakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a little bit unfair. Plenty of people were out and about on Friday, including a man in a wheelchair who told CBC Radio he was taking to the streets despite the snow. My streetcar to work – slow, but making progress – was packed with commuters at 9:30 a.m. We passed at least half a dozen damn-the-torpedoes cyclists plowing along on bikes. For the most part, life went on. Most schools were open, most businesses functioning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But quite a few people took the chance to grab a long weekend, too. Alarmist reports about the snowy horror persuaded many not to venture out at all. One broadcaster covering the storm on CP24 television told viewers simply: “Stay home.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stay home? Ditch work? In Canada's commercial hub? Because of a foot of snow in midwinter? If that's going to be our attitude, we deserve all the gibes that other Canadians throw at us.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Somewhere in Canada today, someone is making plans to set off a bomb that will kill as many people as possible.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We can be fairly certain of this. The past month alone saw three Canadians accused of helping carry out acts of terrorism, two in Algeria and one in Bulgaria. While Canada has very low rates of domestic terrorism and violent extremism, those rates are not zero. There are believed to be several dozen Canadians actively involved with violent Islamist groups. Someone, almost certainly, is planning the next explosion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That leads to two questions: How do we find him? And how do we prevent such violent extremists from being created on (or imported onto) Canadian soil?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We now have far better answers than we did a few years ago. In fact, we have a very clear picture of what makes people into violent radicals – and what doesn't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, a large-scale research report by Canada's spy agency, obtained by Globe and Mail reporter Colin Freeze, reveals that much of what we tend to believe is wrong. In A Study of Radicalization: The Making of Islamist Extremists in Canada Today, the <span class="companylink">Canadian Security Intelligence Service</span> analyzes data on all known Canadian extremists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are almost always native-born Canadians, rarely immigrants, and never refugees. They tend to have “a high level of academic achievement,” often a university degree, especially in “scientific, computer and engineering fields.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only are they not immigrants, but they don't tend to be found within “parallel society” immigrant enclaves. “None appeared to have been marginalized within Canadian society,” CSIS says, and the great majority appear “highly integrated into Canadian society.” And they aren't radicalized by attending a mosque.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This report's findings are virtually identical to those of several larger studies conducted recently. Britain's <span class="companylink">MI5</span> analyzed several hundred violent extremists and found similar non-immigrant (or convert) backgrounds – and that, as in Canada, these terrorists don't come from religious backgrounds. “Most are religious novices,” the security service concluded, and, in fact, “there is evidence that a well-established religious identity actually protects against violent radicalization.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, Mark Fallon, a former U.S. counterterrorism officer, found that migration experiences, religious traditions and theology almost never caused radicalism; it was a matter of local, personal influences persuading people to believe a political narrative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are important conclusions we can draw from these findings. The first is that immigrants, and immigrant communities, have little directly to do with terrorism. They are among those very unlikely to become radicalized. It's not a matter of people bringing foreign attitudes and beliefs to Canada; extremists gained their political ideas here, often from local influences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, revoking the citizenship of people convicted of terrorism – as Immigration Minister Jason Kenney proposed this week – will do little to combat or deter extremism. Nor will spying on communities of ordinary religious Muslim immigrants, as the New York Police Department admitted it had done for six years (and it didn't find a single piece of actionable evidence after investigating thousands of people). As the CSIS report grimly concludes, it's not that easy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, this isn't a matter of religion causing extremism. Yes, Islamic terrorists are, by definition, very religious, but they usually adopt this religion after becoming radicalized politically. The path from strict religious faith to violence simply doesn't exist – in fact, the most religious are among the least likely to become extremists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a political movement based on a territorial claim (what CSIS calls the “common narrative,” which involves securing the “land of Islam” and attacking those who invade or humiliate it). As such, it has more in common with earlier terrorist movements (the IRA, the FLQ) than it does with any widespread beliefs within diaspora communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This doesn't make things easy for police or governments. It's a criminal tendency, neither imported nor theological, not rooted in communities or faiths. At the very least, we now know where we shouldn't bother looking.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the age of 58, Vancouver's Neil Wedman is inching up into the category of senior artist, yet, for the most part, he flies under the radar – an artist's artist with a devoted local following whose work is less well known to the world at large. There are several reasons for this: his chosen calling as a painter in a town whose reputation is defined by photography, the eccentricity of his interests (he recently made a study of vintage Vancouver sidewalks, and can expound on the subject with enthusiasm), and his practise of making figurative pictures that (perversely, intriguingly) border on indecipherable.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite being a painter, though, he shares key attributes with his hometown photo-brethren: a quirky sense of humour (think Rodney Graham) and an inclination to question the medium of photography. If Jeff Wall's photographs respond to the history of painting, infusing photography's ostensible truth-telling with narrative fancy, Wedman's paintings explore the flip side, taking images from his imagination and painting them in a manner that suggests black-and-white photography from faded print media. Explosions in fireworks factories, rainbows in the desert, and dancing cowboys whooping it up by the campfire have been among his pseudo-documentary concoctions, characteristically painted in a monochromatic palette of blue or grey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His new show at Charles H. Scott Gallery in Vancouver brings us up to date with his current preoccupations, and the subject matter is classic Wedman: flying saucers hovering in mid-air, underwater volcanos spewing fiery lava, and newsprint pages rendered as abstracts, with each line of text reduced to a bar of pigment. In all three cases, the paintings and drawings are of things that can't be seen. The newspaper-page watercolours, he says, come from his interest in images in the movies of people reading the news. But what they are reading, he says, always (and maddeningly) lies just beyond our ability to apprehend. As with these watercolours, we are left with just the formal, gridded arrangement of light and shadow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wedman's large grey-on-grey ocean-floor volcano paintings, too, record something that defies observation. (It's dark down there, and how can one have shooting flames underwater?) The resulting images are befuddling. Looking at an exploding volcano, we assume that we are looking up, skyward, but the concentric rings at the top of the painting denote the water surface, which we are accustomed to experiencing as below us. Wedman thus delivers a torque to expectations. Up is down and down is up, air is water and water is air, and the glittering spray of ash seems to celebrate this combustible moment of confusion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The artist's smaller-scale drawings of volcanos and UFOs enact a kindred challenge to perception, rendered in liminal, barely-there gestures that defer conclusive reading. Employing soft conté crayon on woven paper, Wedman uses the texture of the paper to yield a delicate, pointillist effect, reminiscent both of the Ben-Day dots of mechanical reproduction (Roy Lichtenstein is an influence here) and the drawings of the French post-Impressionist Georges Seurat, who tenderly recorded the play of light and darkness in the same manner. In Seurat, tangible reality appeared as a kind of apparition made possible through illumination, taking on a mystical quality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wedman's flying saucers, pictured over the desert or hovering above a city skyline, likewise appear as phantoms signifying the mysterious unknown – what our brains seek to master through perception and cognition. They stand for what's out there, receding beyond the horizon of certainty, and for doubt as a vexing muse, both tormenting and delighting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neil Wedman: Selected Monochromatic Paintings and Works on Paper, Part Two of Two, at Charles H. Scott Gallery, Emily Carr University of Art + Design, continues until Feb. 24. His work can also be seen in the group show From Nature at Vancouver's Equinox Gallery, until Feb. 16.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a certain crackle of energy, almost an ozone smell in the air, when one interviews a celebrity who's about to bump up to the next level of stardom. The handlers are suddenly busier and more numerous, the hair and makeup people hover in a newly solicitous way. During Julianne Hough's (pronounced “huff”) buzz through Toronto last week to promote her new romantic drama, Safe Haven, it was evident that she's at one of those thresholds.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was doing interviews with her co-star, Josh Duhamel – the tall, handsome fellow in the poster, who cradles her face in his hands as he bends down to kiss her – but he was performing much the same function as he does onscreen: supporting Hough, gazing at her, filling in the blanks in her conversation, while letting it all revolve around her. A mere 24 years old, she's a tiny dynamo, with the practiced sparkle common to people who were professionals as children. (She's been dancing competitively since she was 10.) Though it was January, she sported the newest spring clothes – floral dress, corset-style stilettos – and her beauty is just intimidating enough, comfortably between Naomi Watts and the girl next door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Huge audiences already know Hough: that she won back-to-back seasons as one of the professionals on Dancing with the Stars; that her self-titled country album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard country album chart in May, 2008; that she hoofed her way through the film musicals Footloose (2011) and Rock of Ages (2012), and that she dates Ryan Seacrest, the radio star and American Idol host who's on a quest to rule the entertainmentscape as the next Merv Griffin or Dick Clark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are whole swaths of pop-culture consumers to whom she's still “Julianne who?” Safe Haven is the kind of project – not precisely prestigious, but prestige-y enough – that could make her their darling, too. First of all, it opens Valentine's Day, which all but guarantees it an audience. Second, it's based upon a novel by Nicholas Sparks, who inhabits the zeitgeist sweet spot for romantic drama the way Steven King inhabits the one for horror. Safe Haven is the eighth of Sparks's 17 novels to be adapted for film, and the previous seven have delivered – among them, A Walk to Remember, Nights in Rodanthe and, especially, The Notebook, which made bona fide stars out of Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling. And third, it's directed by Lasse Hallstrom, a dab hand at exactly this type of higher-IQ romance (Chocolat, Salmon Fishing in the Yemen).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is also the point at which a celebrity decides what persona she's going to present, and Hough has chosen sincerity, which works for her. “I suck at [being guarded],” she says. “I'm an open book. I have no filter. And sometimes that's a bad thing. But at least you know it's honest.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, she chose to reveal to Cosmopolitan that she was “abused, mentally, physically, everything” between the ages of 10, when she moved from her native Salt Lake City to London to study dance after her Mormon parents split up – her father was twice chairman of the Utah Republican Party, and both her parents and all four grandparents danced competitively – and 15, when she came back to the United States. In a largely improvised scene in Safe Haven, her character, who's on the run from a battering husband, describes the loss of personality that results from abuse; the speech seems to come directly from Hough's own life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Hough is about nothing if not forward momentum; her spine is too steely to allow her to wallow. “I championed Julianne for this film because I knew she was hungry, a hard worker, sweet and down to earth,” Duhamel says. “On a movie like this, where everything depends upon the connection between the two people, there can't be any hang-ups. And with her, there are none. She is who she is. It made it easy to open up to her, and for her to open up to me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's my first real opportunity to show a different side from the performance/dancing side of what I've done,” Hough says. “Everything's been so – not exactly campy, but a little bit. This was a lot more raw.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But I think everybody feels that – ‘I have so much more inside of me, I just need the shot,'” she continues. “What I've learned in the last little bit, I think I was trying so hard to prove that I was so much more than a dancer and singer that I downplayed them, instead of just embracing them.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and Duhamel, who is 40, have that in common: They're both creatures of television who are trying to be taken seriously as film actors. He was born in North Dakota, and was a model and a soap actor (on All My Children) before landing a lead role in the NBC series Las Vegas and a recurring one in the Transformers movies. “I always feel like I'm trying to bust out of some kind of box,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both also have public love stories with more-famous partners – Duhamel's wife is Stacy Ann Ferguson – “Fergie” of the Black-Eyed Peas; they've been together for nine years. “Ryan [Seacrest] and my wife, they're both well-adjusted to the business,” Duhamel says. “They both understand what we're doing, and they're both supportive. I actually talked to Ryan before we shot and said, ‘Listen, I know this is a very romantic movie, but I love my wife, and I want you to know I respect you.' He was like, ‘Yeah. Of course.' Then I felt dumb for even bringing it up.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hough continues her habit of frankness with me: She admits that her relationship with Seacrest wasn't love at first sight. “Sometimes it doesn't have to be bells and whistles,” she says. “I was very guarded.” Seacrest is an influential person, she was 18 and new in L.A., and she wanted to “create my own career and my own life. Let's just say I made him work.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She cackles gleefully describing their first date, which occurred when she was 22, four years after he first expressed interest. “I basically interviewed him,” she says. “I was like, ‘How many years have your team been working with you? 15? So you're loyal, okay, good. And how close are you with your family?' This went on for three hours.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Wow,” Duhamel says. “I don't know how long I would have lasted.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I feared the worst, but it turned out to be the best,” Hough says, smiling blissfully. “My character in Safe Haven wasn't looking for love. And I definitely was not. But you know it when you find it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just like you know a star is rising when you see one.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The calls, which masqueraded as an opinion survey, appear to have been a classic “push poll” designed to plant opinions rather than harvest them. They warned that “Saskatchewan values” would be undermined because urban areas would be pitted against rural ones by changes to the province's riding boundaries proposed by the independent Federal Electoral Boundaries Commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The failure to indicate, as rules require, during the calls – or on either of the messages callers heard if they called back the number, or when the party was specifically asked about its involvement – that the calls were being made on behalf of the Conservatives was blamed on “internal miscommunication.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I either worked there or was fired there for quite a while. We internally miscommunicated our way through many a lunch rush.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I imagine that had that nice lady ever tried to impart to me that I must never ask the customers whether, for example, knowing that the borscht at a competing café was made with cat-urine stock would make them more or less likely to dine there, I might have ended up asking just such a question.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's instead take a cue from Conservative MP Brad Trost, who, when questioned regarding the calls, said, “I don't think there was anything wrong with the robo-call. I think it was good and accurate information and we should stand behind it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Canada's Candide went on to add, “I didn't hear it. I don't know the script. Don't know anything. … One of my colleagues had it at her residence and her husband got it and he said it was fine. I'll take his word for it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We may have lost the penny this week, but I hope we coined the word “Trostful,” which I will define as “marked by a total belief in the reliability, truth and strength of anything your colleague tells you was said to her by her husband, or similar evidence.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most Trostful interpretation of the Conservatives' push poll is that in their anxiety over what they genuinely believe to be a threat to core Saskatchewan values – and certainly not out of any fear that it might cause the party to lose one or two seats in the next election – mistakes were made. Nothing less than the Saskatchewan way of life was at stake, remember. No one was thinking straight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things got said. Memos got written. Then deleted. Perhaps a Web hosting and marketing service was called and discussions were had about how best to allocate Conservative Party resources in the face of this looming crisis?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should they spend what money they had sending out recorded messages to endangered rural Saskatchewan voters in the hopes of reversing the course of history? Or should they accept that all would soon be lost, and set out, Alan Lomax-style, to record the songs of this soon-to-vanish culture before its voices were lost forever?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It looks as if they decided on the send-out-recorded-messages option. Which was optimistic of them. They should be applauded for that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe, in the stress of the whole affair, a Conservative staffer began drunk-robo-calling: “I'm calling on behalf of the <span class="companylink">government of Canada</span> to inform you that you are gorgeous, eligible to vote, and yes, that is a polling station in my pants.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be up to the CRTC to decide if a fine should be levied over the calls. The nature of the “internal miscommunication” may never be revealed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, by Wednesday, the Conservatives appeared to have lost interest in challenging the boundary changes. The traditional electoral boundaries to which the people of Saskatchewan cling, along which they lay their traplines in the winter and hang their clothes in the summer, may indeed be lost forever.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My favourite scene in The Bell Jar is halfway through the novel, when our heroine, Esther Greenwood, takes all her clothes up the elevator and throws them off the roof of her hotel. “Piece by piece, I fed my wardrobe to the night wind,” she tells us, “and flutteringly, like a loved one's ashes, the grey scraps were ferried off, to settle here, there, exactly where I would never know, in the dark heart of New York.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This sentence, and the unforgettable image it evokes of a solitary girl shedding her fancy false skin, bit by bit, is the feminist equivalent of F. Scott Fitzgerald's “boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.” Every time I read it, I am reminded of exactly what it felt like to be that girl: young, anxious, ambitious, and adrift in the chaos of the city; a girl both thrilled and crippled by the problem of how I was supposed to feel and who I was supposed to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I remember that sensation of the inside of my life not matching the outside – putting on dress after dress, going to work-related parties, drinking strange-tasting drinks with strange-tasting people. “I was supposed to be having,” as Esther puts it, “the time of my life.” But on the inside, I felt like the still and empty eye of the tornado “moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullabaloo.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Esther, I was a small-town girl in my early twenties who ended up getting a dream job right out of school. Like her, I should have been “steering the city like my own private car.” And from the outside, perhaps, it looked like I was. In reality, I spent a lot of time hyperventilating into spike-heeled boots in restaurant bathrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not trying to be self-piteous or melodramatic here. I think this is how every reasonable young person feels who is wrested from the gentle, politically correct arms of a liberal-arts education and thrown into the competitive, alcoholic frenzy of single urban life. Particularly young women. That sensation – of being young and promising and enviable; and at the same time lonely and lost and confused – is the bourgeois human condition from age 20 to 25 (and in some sad cases, much longer).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has inspired a plethora of great fiction, from Margaret Atwood's The Edible Woman, J.M. Coetzee's Youth, Melissa Bank's The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing, Sheila Heti's How Should a Person Be? to virtually anything by Lorrie Moore, as well as all of TV's best heroines, from Mary Richards to Carrie Bradshaw to Hannah on Girls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's even an episode of The Simpsons in which Lisa ignores her brother's cafeteria shenanigans, nose deep in The Bell Jar. Lisa, were she allowed to grow up, would certainly take after Esther, and Plath herself: a small-town girl bound for great things but hampered by relentless self-criticism and a tendency to over-think; a girl, in other words, who should probably end up running the world but who might just end up in a psychiatric ward, as Esther does. Or worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sylvia Plath killed herself in 1967, four years after The Bell Jar came out under a pseudonym and just a month after the book's British publication under her own name. (It wasn't released in the United States until 1971, in accordance with the wishes of her mother and her husband, the poet Ted Hughes.) Because of the proximity of her death to publication, the novel was, and still is, read largely as a juvenile roman à clef – the fictional version of a misery memoir, or worse yet, the thinking woman's chick lit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, Plath's novel is so much better than that. Rereading it this week, I was astonished by how beautifully it holds up compared to other work that resonated with me as a teenager (Jack Kerouac's On the Road, say, which now reads like a hash-induced undergraduate journal entry; or any movie with Christian Slater). Its genius lies not in its drama but in its subtlety and restraint. While today's anxious urban heroines are busy self-harming, having masochistic sex or becoming addicted to crystal meth (think of all those memoirs by such clever, troubled girls as Elizabeth Wurtzel and Emma Forrest), Esther finds herself alienated by the simple trappings of city life: a misused finger bowl here, the dull throb of afternoon vodka there, food poisoning from the crab salad in an avocado pear. These are the things that send her skidding into the quicksand of depression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In honour of the book's 50th anniversary, Faber has rereleased it with a new candy-pink retro cover design featuring a heavily made-up young woman applying powder from a compact. The blowback from fans has been fierce. The London Review of Books called the cover “silly,” and the Jezebel bloggers were predictably enraged. Faber has defended the cover by pointing out that it was merely trying to reach out to a new reader for the novel, one who might “enjoy its brilliance without knowing anything about the poetry, or the broader context of Plath's work.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personally, I'm all for this. And given the fact that much of the book is focused on the confining trappings of 1960s femininity – high heels, powder puffs and the like – a cover illustrating this is in many ways appropriate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bell Jar is less a book about female oppression than about the loneliness of youth and mental illness. And in any case, one pink cover is in no danger of trivializing the legacy of this great novel. As usual, when it comes to the debate over Plath, everyone needs to just calm down. Forget the biography, focus on the art. Read the book. Meaningful thoughts will follow.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are President Barack Obama's words from his second inaugural address: “We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations.” Thence followed 10 sentences about climate change.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Edmonton and Ottawa, where governments had grown confident that Mr. Obama, once re-elected, would give the green light to the Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta's bitumen oil deposits to the Gulf of Mexico, those sentences were at least worrisome, if not menacing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why did Mr. Obama do it? Climate change was scarcely raised in the election campaign. A Republican-controlled House of Representatives will block any cap-and-trade system for greenhouse-gas emissions, plus just about anything else to reduce emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so many other priorities – budget deficit, gun control, immigration – why did the President spend so much of his inaugural speech on an issue the Alberta and Canadian governments figured had disappeared from his radar screen. Maybe he was just playing to history, in which case the sentences will disappear into the political ether. Or maybe he actually believes what he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once re-elected, Canadian governments presumed Mr. Obama would approve Keystone – and, on balance, he probably still will. But his speech sent a frisson of apprehension through Canada and the private companies backing the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama had delayed a decision on Keystone before the election, despite Prime Minister Stephen Harper's saying U.S. approval should be a “no-brainer.” Mr. Obama actually has a brain and, like Mr. Harper, he has political antennae. Just as Mr. Harper nixed a foreign takeover of <span class="companylink">Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan</span> for largely political reasons, Mr. Obama delayed Keystone to please environmentalists who'd supported him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, as then, the President's decision will swirl around politics. <span class="companylink">TransCanada Pipelines</span>, Keystone's proponent, has changed the route in Nebraska, thereby bringing the Republican governor onside. Trade unions, a key part of the Democrats' constituency, want the jobs and economic spinoffs Keystone would bring. Fifty-five senators, including nine Democrats, signed a letter urging Mr. Obama to approve the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil from Canada, bitumen or otherwise, is deemed by foreign-policy analysts to be more “secure” than that from elsewhere. If Alberta oil didn't make it to the Gulf of Mexico refineries, oil from somewhere else would arrive. Canada is safe, reliable and friendly. Who could ask for anything more?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So foreign-policy considerations plus parts of the Democratic Party coalition would suggest that Keystone will get the nod, if not soon then perhaps by midyear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet, what about those inaugural sentences? The largest U.S. environmental groups overwhelmingly oppose Keystone, although the journal Nature recently said bitumen oil isn't as dirty as critics say and thus the pipeline should go ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These groups, who hailed Mr. Obama's pre-election delay, supported him on voting day and still do. They expect payback. And what about the new Secretary of State, John Kerry? He spent years in the Senate railing against greenhouse-gas emissions, sponsoring bills and urging action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His department has to make a recommendation to the President, who is free to ignore or accept it. In one ear, he will hear the national security arguments for Keystone and the negative impact its rejection would have on relations with the Harper government; in the other, he will hear echoes of his own words as a senator. (He was non-committal on Friday after meeting Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird in Washington.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, Mr. Obama will decide. He has identified climate change as a major challenge and spoke in that inaugural speech about taking the “path toward sustainable energy sources,” a path that excludes or minimize the use of fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He once promised a cap-and-trade system for emissions, but that died in Congress even when the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress. It has no chance of revival any time soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's left to him are executive orders that don't need congressional approval. Did Mr. Obama mean what he said? Is Keystone his line in the sand?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was Jan. 1, 2011. The <span class="companylink">Washington Capitals</span> had just defeated the <span class="companylink">Pittsburgh Penguins</span> 3-1 in the Winter Classic, held on Pittsburgh's Heinz Field following a long rain delay.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crosby moved to a podium to answer questions. The No.1 topic was the weather, No.2 the game, a distant third the shoulder that knocked Crosby to the ice at the end of the second period. Briefly dazed then, he seemed fine now as he sat and spoke to the media. He seemed fine, and he had taken the first shift of the third period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I couldn't tell you what happened,” he said. “Got my head, for sure. But I can't comment on it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No comment: the usual hockey player's answer to questions that might lead to further, harder questions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a few days later, in another game, he would be hit again, and reality would set in. Concussion symptoms would restrict him to a mere 28 games over the next 18 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He wouldn't be able to play, but he could think and reflect. The 23-year-old is now 25: Sid the Kid is now Sid the Man. They used to say his lips looked too big for his face, but he's grown into them in more ways than one – they no longer murmur the comforting clichés that young sports stars use as a shield. Before this past year, no one would have mistaken him for a spokesperson for anything but his many endorsements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the stolid Face of Hockey from the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s 2004-05 lockout emerged transformed into the Voice of Hockey with the 2012 lockout. Prepared to speak out on matters from player safety to Olympic participation, the Penguins leader has symbolically brought the entire league under his captaincy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a much different Sidney Crosby than the one Canada thought it knew so well when he scored the overtime goal that brought the country Olympic gold at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Games. He is still the iconic name that Canadian children shout out in their mini-sticks games, but he is now much more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This Sidney Crosby is more connected to his off-ice experiences – to the long months spent recovering from concussion, when he turned to reading rather than video games. He became a bit of a history buff, keen on war stories and tales of leadership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather tellingly, his favourite book over those tough times was Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption.He has much to say and is not afraid to say it. On an early February weekend in Ottawa, with his Penguins practising at a small suburban rink packed with hundreds of screaming kids who have come to see him, he dawdles with a journalist in the far corner of the dressing room, long after the others have left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a rare private audience, and the last phrase Crosby would turn to these days is “no comment.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crosby now firmly believes that player safety is hockey's major issue, and that responsibility runs all the way from Timbits hockey to the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>. While the league has made some movement on the dreaded and dangerous head shots, there are still far too many concussions in the game. He knows more change will have to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think it starts when you're younger,” Crosby says. “That's definitely where you learn all your habits and all the things that you're going to grow up and do. But that being said, I think the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> is obviously what everyone watches, so there's got to be a balancing act there.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">NHL</span>, he also believes, has to allow its players to go the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. He wants, once again, to represent his country, but the league has yet to confirm that NHLers will be released.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's coming fast,” he says. “I've only played I think maybe 80 or 90 games since the last Olympics, so it's coming up pretty quickly. … I think everyone who has experienced that wants to be a part of it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crosby found his voice in the months leading up to the end of the recent lockout. He stood front and centre, usually on the right hand of <span class="companylink">NHL Players Association</span> head Donald Fehr, as the players pleaded their case and challenged the owners to meet and give. He came with <span class="companylink">Pittsburgh Penguins</span> owner Ron Burkle to the most significant meetings of the long dispute. He was informed, articulate, passionate and, unlike certain others, always calm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a hockey superstar to be so involved in the business of the game is unheard of, unless you go all the way back to Terrible Ted Lindsay and the early attempts to form a players' union in the 1950s. No one among the elite of Jean Béliveau, Gordie Howe, Bobby Orr, Mario Lemieux or Wayne Gretzky – Crosby's superstar role models – took on such a role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other current stars either ran off to play in Europe or waited the standoff out in hometown rinks. The other NHLers who spoke out – such as Chris Campoli, Josh Gorges or George Parros – are journeymen by comparison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I felt that there was a deal that could be worked out for both sides,” Crosby says. “I think the frustrating part of the process was when we weren't meeting. I always knew that from our point of view we were always willing to meet, but when you hear that there wasn't going to be any meetings for the next couple of weeks, well. … We had all that progress in New York for those few days, and then it was off the table. It just seemed like there was a better way.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was not naive enough to think a singular plea could solve the impasse, but he felt there was something larger than the squabble – the game itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I care about hockey. I love the game. I felt like it wasn't doing anyone any good, especially all the fans, but also the game that we had grown over the last seven or eight years – it wasn't doing the game any good. So I felt like I needed to be vocal for that reason.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crosby's long-time agent, Pat Brisson of Los Angeles, says that Crosby has always been acutely respectful of other players. When Crosby was a 16-year-old junior phenomenon with the Rimouski Océanic, he told Brisson to refuse the endorsement offers that flooded in after he signed with Reebok and Gatorade. He didn't want to go too far, too soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brisson remembers Crosby telling him, “It's not right. I haven't even played in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> yet. What will NHLers think of me?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pittsburgh general manager Ray Shero has watched his captain grow over the past several years, and says he was pleased to see Crosby step up during the four-month lockout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was good for the players,” Shero says, “but it was also good for him.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it a new maturity? His agent questions that. “When I first met him,” Brisson says, “he was 13 years old and asked questions a 15-, 16-year-old might ask. When he was 16, he was talking like a 20-year-old.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It might be more apt, he suggests, to say Crosby has become more reflective. He believes that the changes in the young man from Cole Harbour, N.S., have their genesis in Crosby's struggles to overcome the fog of concussion, as well as in his own contract negotiations last summer, which led to a 12-year, $104.4-million (U.S.) deal with the Penguins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crosby spent much of his down time becoming more interested in the world apart from hockey. Along with Unbroken, he read other books about military events, such as Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and The Lost Heroes of Seal Team 10. He likes to watch Homeland, the television series about a CIA agent and a soldier returning from years as a prisoner of war in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brisson recalls coming back from a holiday with his wife to Bora Bora: Instead of just looking at vacation pictures, Crosby told them all about the Pacific island's strategic role as a supply base for the United States. during the Second World War.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to the game, though, Crosby says he is a determined “traditionalist.” In Winnipeg recently to play the Jets, he insisted on walking down Portage Avenue in minus-40-with-windchill weather, so he could “feel the Canadian winter” and get in a proper frame of mind for the game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also thinks that players have a responsibility to their fans. Basketball superstar Charles Barkley once famously said, “I'm not a role model. … Just because I dunk a basketball, doesn't mean I should raise your kids.” Crosby believes the opposite, and he takes it very seriously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He had time to question his future,” Brisson says of Crosby's time away from the rink. “It gave him time to reflect. He had to think about things from a different perspective.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During last summer's contract talks, Crosby became deeply involved in the negotiations, particularly over his concern that his concussion history might deprive him of full insurance. It forced him to recognize the fragility of a hockey career and made him more aware of players with far less security.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“From a business standpoint,” Brisson says, “he grew a lot from those two years. It's another chapter in his book.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there was more than business to reflect on over those long months when he could not play. There's the question of safety, of course. “The grassroots have to kind of help to build that,” he says, “but as a league you have to be aware of that, too. Because that's what all the kids and all the young players are trying to play as – that's what they're watching.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he also got to think about the journey – and the geography – of his hockey career. He believes that while hockey is the same game in the United States and Canada, it is also not the same – as he was reminded by the couple of thousand young players and parents who crammed into that small Ottawa rink this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don't think you can describe it unless you've grown up in it and have experienced it,” he says. “I've been in Pittsburgh a long time now and I've seen the passion that people have for hockey there, but there's also football and baseball in town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think when you look in the Canadian cities it's hockey. Hockey is the big thing in town and it's all about that team. I think that's really what separates it from everything else.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And with that heritage in mind, he promises there will be more to come from the new Voice of Hockey. “I don't feel I need to share my opinion on everything in the world,” he says. “But when I feel pretty passionate about something I will speak up.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they will listen.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As I scanned the vast expanse of smooth and oddly bronzed skin on display, it occurred to me that there had probably been more wax deployed on these bodies in one day than the Canadian ski team uses in a month. The models, male and female, pranced across the stage at the hotel wearing very little at all. In Toronto! In the middle of a snowstorm! In February! I felt like I'd landed in Sorels and Gomorrah.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Was this the prudish hometown I'd left for nearly a dozen years? The town Christopher Plummer once called a “mausoleum of morality”? The old Orange Order would have seen red.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best part? The event was a fundraiser for the Toronto Public Library system, called the Book Lover's Ball (although you could have added one letter to that name and more appropriately reflected the nature of the evening). The gyrations on stage were, in fact, interpretive renditions of various Canadian books, though I'm sad to say there was no near-naked interpretation of my colleague Jeffrey Simpson's excellent new analysis of the crisis in health care, Chronic Condition. Sex and books: two things Canadians do well. Could this not be our new identity in the world?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We were all given a bag of books to bring home, one of which was the new erotic novel S.E.C.R.E.T.. I immediately began to read it – for research purposes, you understand. The book, which caused a bidding war among publishers, is about a weary young widow's initiation into a matriarchal sex club where all her fantasies are fulfilled by a succession of loving and lovely men. It was written under the pseudonym L. Marie Adeline, but the author is actually Canadian novelist Lisa Gabriele, who told The Globe this week: “Fingers crossed! I'll make Canada proud of my filthy book.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately for fans of CanLit, the novel is set in New Orleans. I was hoping for a little action around Canada's famous roadside attractions – main characters making the crustacean with two backs next to the giant lobster in Shediac, maybe, or getting goosed in Wawa. Still, there's to be a sequel. I'm hoping the world's largest Easter egg figures prominently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The point is, we're a hot people, as anyone will discover who takes the time to dig beneath layers of Gore-Tex, sodden tissues and ambivalence. We should be marketing ourselves accordingly. <span class="companylink">U.S. News &amp; World Report</span> put Canada at the top of a list of sexiest countries, batting away the inevitable doubters: “Shocked to see our northern, hockey-obsessed neighbours on the list?” We had earned the accolade, the magazine suggested, through our friendliness, our “laid-back” nature and our production of Ryan Reynolds. Steam leaked from our parkas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Movie stars, pah! Books are the real path to our new identity as a global sexual powerhouse. Which is why I was a little surprised at the furore over the depiction of Anne Shirley that arose this week. The uproar, in case you missed it, centred around a new cover for the Anne of Green Gables series that was advertised on Amazon. In place of the tempestuous ginger orphan familiar to every Canadian child, there was a blond cowgirl who appeared to have graduated from the Jessica Simpson School of Pouting and Hair Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A righteous clamour arose, and the cover photo on that particular edition disappeared from Amazon. But why the fuss? It's clear proof that the world doesn't see us as a land of angry prepubescent orphans or hermits who live in abandoned sawmills, but strapping, sexually appealing young folk. Whose noses never run, and whose fingertips are never lost to frostbite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why stop with Anne? We could rebrand all of literature to better reflect our new global identity as the land of lust. Hagar Shipley in a bustier, reclining in Prairie wheat; Susanna Moodie in a fetching rabbit-skin bikini, with the snow artfully caught in her hair, and all signs of hypothermia airbrushed out. We wouldn't even need to change the title of her book!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other titles of the great Canadian canon could use a bit of tweaking if we're to sell our naughtiness to the world: Me and My Cathouse; Filth Business; The Extremely Tight Hockey Sweater. Pamela Anderson could be the series editor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We'd be doing the country a favour. Canada has a bit of an identity crisis on the world stage, which is to say that it has no real identity. The odd time the country makes news around the world, it's usually because there's been a decapitation or mall shooting or a damning report about failing to act on climate change, which prompts the reaction: Canadians, hmm? I'd forgotten about them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But no longer, not once the great patriotic rebranding begins, and we straddle this world like a colossus and squeeze for all it's worth. I've got a slogan to get us started – Canada: We'll See You Between the Covers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no denying how crucial resource development is to this country. Without it we wouldn't enjoy the high standard of living that we do – a fact often overlooked amid the rancorous debate that constantly envelops this sector of the economy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, it provided Canadians with 750,000 jobs. And the federal government estimates that the more than 600 resource projects either under way or in the planning stages, represent $650-billion in new investments over the next 10 years. In 2011, resource extraction contributed $66-billion toward the country's gross domestic product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is why it's vital that the government not only safeguard these assets but also do everything possible to meet the challenges being issued by environmental watchdogs rightfully highlighting the risks that these ventures represent. When the government fails on this front, it undermines its case for taking advantage of new resource opportunities – such as the Northern <span class="companylink">Gateway</span> pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which brings me to the release this week of a report by federal Environment Commissioner Scott Vaughan that, among other things, pointed out how important it is that the country's environmental protections keep up with economic development. Something that hasn't been happening in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The observation that received the most attention in B.C. was his assessment that the government is inadequately prepared for an oil spill that could result from a hole opening up on a massive oil tanker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said there are only plans in place to handle a leak of up to 10,000 tonnes. The football-field-sized boats that would be coming to B.C. to load up on crude gushing through the proposed Northern <span class="companylink">Gateway</span> pipeline, for instance, can handle more than 300,000 tonnes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That bit of news was the last thing Ottawa, or the Alberta government for that matter, needed to hear. It was simply more ammunition for the forces fighting to kill the project and any like it. That's why it was so dangerous for a Conservative government that sorely needs the tax dollars these projects generate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vaughan was equally concerned about the current level of liability funding in place in the event an accident occurred. Right now that figure is about $1.3-billion per spill. In 2002, a tanker that lost 63,200 tonnes of oil off the coast of Spain produced damage claims exceeding $1.4-billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should also be pointed out that the commissioner said tanker oil spills have decreased over the past two decades and are, in fact, rare because of modern navigation equipment and improved, double hull construction. But that fact was mostly lost in media reports that zeroed in on the alarms that the commissioner was sounding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vaughan issued similar worries about our capacity to handle problems erupting from offshore oil and gas activities in the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We identified several shortcomings, including insufficient spill response tools across the federal government, inadequately tested capacity, poorly co-ordinated response plans, and out-of-date or missing agreements between the boards and supporting departments,” the commissioner wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the liability limits for incidents involving offshore oil and gas development have not been updated in 25 years and range up to $40-million. Our thresholds are significantly lower than other countries. As a bit of context, Mr. Vaughan pointed out that the commission looking into the BP Deepwater Horizon spill (where damage claims exceeded $40-billion US) found that the $75-million liability limit in place in the U.S. was totally inadequate and placed taxpayers at risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He found similar liability exposure issues in our nuclear industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, the oversight regime governing resource development in the Far North sounds almost non-existent. The commissioner said that Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada was not conducting the required inspections essential to ensuring the terms and conditions of project approvals are being met.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011, more than 70 per cent of required site visits were not conducted. It's basically an environmental free-for-all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As I say, none of this helps a federal government witnessing increasing hostility toward several major resource development proposals, including Northern <span class="companylink">Gateway</span> and the Kinder Morgan pipelines in B.C. The government will only damage the prospects for these projects even further – if that's possible – by playing fast-and-loose with the rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Prime Minister needs to take Mr. Vaughan's report seriously and assure Canadians that Ottawa will guarantee that natural resource development and environmental stewardship move forward in lockstep. Otherwise, the environmental battles we see now will only grow bigger and more costly.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's been a long time since Canada could take advantages for granted in Olympic hockey competition.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's 93 years since team secretary W.A. Hewitt, who also happened to be sports editor of The Toronto Star, was asked if he'd mind refereeing the first Olympic match at the Antwerp Games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it's 89 years since ringer Harold (Moose) Watson predicted Canada would whip the Americans 10-0 or 12-0 in the gold-medal match at Chamonix, France. Perhaps the fact that the final score was only 6-1 – with Moose picking up three goals to take his Olympic total to a record 36 – was a harbinger of decades to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There would be a day when Canada would just be one of several teams with a chance at Olympic glory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sochi will presumably mark the fifth time <span class="companylink">NHL</span> players have been released by their clubs to play for their countries. In that time, Canada has won two gold medals (Salt Lake City, 2002; Vancouver, 2010), finished fourth in Nagano in 1998, and came a shocking seventh in Turin in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are lessons for Sochi in all of these victories and losses, but whether they will be heeded will not be known until the gold-medal game slated for Feb. 23, 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will Canada win that gold-medal game or not? And if not, why not?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russia has already sent back some good advice for Canadian teams headed over there. The junior Team Canada was in Ufa over Christmas and New Year's with Canada's usual “gold-or-nothing” attitude and returned with nothing, despite sending some fabulous young talent over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lessons of Ufa are simple:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Don't grab an <span class="companylink">NHL</span> head coach – in the case of the world juniors, a major-junior head coach – and send him off to win in international competition. Make sure most, if not all, of the coaching staff have considerable international hockey experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Do not presume to play your game on their ice, as the Canadian coaching staff stated it would in Turin. It is not the same game. Only the equipment, the size of the nets and the puck is the same; everything else is in another world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Do not continue to assemble the best players and presume they can perform assigned and unfamiliar functions. There is no need for the traditional “grinder” lines of <span class="companylink">NHL</span> and major junior. The most any team will play another is twice in such competition – no time for personal grudges to build up, no point to avenging anything the way international hockey is called. The very idea of turning young Nathan MacKinnon into a grinder for Ufa was preposterous. He might be the hottest prospect in hockey, but he was invisible in Ufa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The abiding theory in putting together Canadian teams has been to gather together the top players, assemble the machine and, over time, work out the kinks. While this can work, and has worked for Canada, it is worth noting players familiar with each other and teams dedicated to speed often have success in the Olympics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Swiss beat Canada in Turin. The Slovaks came within a shot of taking Canada to overtime in Vancouver, and were, at the time, in control of the game. The tough games aren't always the ones checked off in advance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, there is the matter of size. Canada – for reasons that baffle – was given exceptional permission by the <span class="companylink">International Olympic Committee</span> to stick to the smaller <span class="companylink">NHL</span> ice surface in Vancouver, and this undoubtedly proved helpful as Canada and the United States faced off in the gold-medal game. No such variance will be available in Sochi, where the regulation Olympic ice surface will return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Canada were to put together one team for the big ice and one team for the North American ice, they would not be the same. Or at least they should not be the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The forwards Team Canada chooses for Sochi should be as adept at cycling as they are at shooting, as skilled working the boards as they are coming through centre ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The defence will need to be as mobile as possible. In international hockey, the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s much loved “stay-at-home” defenceman is a liability, not a plus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Canadian NHL players are finding officiating in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> confusing as the shrunken season speeds along, just wait until they hear the first few whistles in Sochi. It is popular in Canada to dismiss international officiating as incompetent, but it is really just different, and likely no more consistent or inconsistent than <span class="companylink">NHL</span> officiating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The greatest difference may well be in off-ice rulings. If the players think NHL vice-president Brendan Shanahan can be quick with the suspension, think again. You'll pay much more for stupidity in international hockey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And finally, there has been one important lesson in all the previous four Olympic competitions that have included <span class="companylink">NHL</span> players: Luck will take some unexpected shifts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Dominik Hasek in Nagano, to Martin Gerber in Turin, Canada can run into goaltending that cannot be solved in a single game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Salt Lake City, it was clear to all, even Team Canada, the best team in the tournament was Sweden – only to see Sweden doomed by a Belarus dump-in that wouldn't even have hit the net if it hadn't bounced off goaltender Tommy Salo's glove, head, back and into the net.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It happens. It almost happened in Vancouver, where pesky Slovakia had a skate on Canada's throat in the dying minutes, only to see Pavol Demitra either miss the net or Roberto Luongo make a miracle save, take your choice.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Chinese families across Metro Vancouver gather for their New Year festivities this weekend, the dining tables will look drastically different than they did a decade ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There will be dumplings galore, dumplings being the most auspicious celebratory dish in northern Chinese cuisines. But the banquet boards will also be laden with water-boiled fish swimming in fire-engine red chili oil, cumin-scented lamb, smoked pork, pickled peppers, preserved mustard greens and cold-poached chicken smothered in dried chilis and tingly Sichuan peppercorns.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent explosion of Mainland Chinese immigration has brought drastic change to local Chinese cooking. Goodbye, mild Cantonese. Hello, spicy Sichuan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The immigration patterns are quite astounding. According to Andy Yan, an urban researcher with Bing Thom Architects, Mandarin speakers from Mainland China and elsewhere, including Taiwan, increased 91 per cent between 2001 and 2011. (The numbers are based upon the Canadian census question of “language spoken most often at home.” While there were some changes in measuring methodology, he says the numbers are comparable.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vancouver's new diversity and taste for bolder flavours is the largest trend in Chinese dining. To celebrate the year of the snake, I called upon some of my favourite Chinese-food feasting partners to share their best-of restaurant list. Although I wouldn't recommend heading to any of these eateries this weekend unless you made reservations months ago, we hope it will help you navigate the new spice trail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spicy Beauty: 1707 Kingsway, Vancouver; 604-559-6611</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newest Sichuan restaurant on the scene isn't the greatest. Mutton with wild pickled peppers was overly marinated and spongy the night I visited. And many of the dishes tasted dark and acrid, as if the chilis had lingered too long in a sizzling wok. But the chef, who is actually Sichuanese and cooked at a high-end Sichuan restaurant in a Hong Kong hotel before coming to Vancouver, shows creativity: the spiral crackers added to his chili chicken are a decidedly modern textural innovation. The spiffy décor – dark wooden tables and chairs are all imported from China – is a step up from the standard hole-in-the-wall linoleum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ma La Niu Niu (Spice Girl Hotpot): 1185-8580 Alexandra Rd., Richmond; 604-303-0086</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All-you-can-eat hotpot is the most popular way to eat Sichuan in Vancouver, says food blogger Fernando Medrano of wisemonkeysblog.com. Whereas a Japanese hotpot is served with one shared vat of boiling broth in which to dip your meat and vegetables, a Sichuan hotpot is split into two sides – one hot, one mild. “I'm a spice fiend,” Mr. Medrano says. “But this one was a challenge.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alvin Garden: 4850 Imperial St., Burnaby; 604-437-0828</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Sichuan's distinctive ma la seasoning is too numbing for your palate, you might enjoy the chili-oil-glistened shininess of Hunan cuisine. Rather than just piling on the mentholated peppercorns, Hunan uses more pickled peppers, smoking and braised meats. The food can be blistering hot at this little place in Burnaby, especially if you order da la (which literally means big heat). “But there's a tightness and focus to the cooking,” food writer Lee Man says. “You can taste the underlying freshness.” Mr. Man recommends beef stir-fried with pickled pepper, Hunan bacon with smoked bamboo shoots, sliced pig heart and the celery and tofu skin salad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lucky Noodle: 3-3377 Kingsway, Vancouver; 604-430-8818</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another Hunan restaurant, the cooking here is a bit more rustic, a little less finessed than Alvin Garden. Lucky does a bang-up job of dongting (water-boiled fish in chili soup). “It gives you a big punch in the face,” exclaims Mr. Medrano, who also suggests ordering anything with house-made bacon and smoked bamboo. I vouch for the sour shredded potatoes with chili. It's like Chinese poutine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Li's China Grill: 4-3377 Kingsway, Vancouver; 604-568-1832</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located next door to Lucky Noodle, Li's is a Sichuan barbecue joint that specializes in Chongqing grilled fish, which is apparently very trendy in Singapore and Beijing. Served whole, the fish (here it's typically rock cod, ling cod or catfish) is grilled in the kitchen then served at the table (in a big sharing pan over a butane burner) heaped with a choice of four toppings. Mr. Medrano and friends preferred the dry chili rub. “It had a nice char and smokiness. It tasted like a beach fish fry in Thailand.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nine Dishes 960 Kingsway, 778-282-8699</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone loves Nine Dishes. Not because of the food, which is basic Sichuan at best. But because of the owner, an eccentric named Yves Shen, who presides over the gonzo atmosphere. Want to eat? Fill out your own order and bring it to him at the counter. Feel like rice? Go scoop it out of the cooker in the corner. Thirsty? The choice is beer or beer, but it's only $2 a bottle. Dry sausage, studded with peppercorns and thinly sliced, is the house specialty. You might also want to try cumin-grilled lamb shoulder skewers and boiled fish served in a metal tureen. Mr. Shen presents the fish with a ceremonial flourish, scooping off what looks like two pounds of dry chilis to reveal velvety poached basa filets floating in oil. But if you want to take home the leftovers, you'll have to pack it yourself.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years ago, Canada's health department posed some tough questions to a panel of international experts about the risks to young people of energy drinks supercharged with caffeine. Should the labels say adult-use only? the department asked. Yes, the expert panel said. Should the labels warn of possible heart problems? Yes, the panel said. What else should be done? Collect information from coroners on deaths linked to the drinks, the panel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the government has to ask, you know it's a problem. And the answers say it's a problem. But Canadians haven't got the message, and aren't pushing the government terribly hard to do something. It's flown under the radar.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drinks are on the radar of children and teenagers. Noni MacDonald, who chaired that expert panel, was on a bus in downtown Ottawa last month and overheard four youngsters – she estimates their ages at 10 or 12 – talking about using caffeinated energy drinks to “get ready” for their hockey game. “They see zero risks,” Dr. MacDonald, a professor in pediatrics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why are such young athletes trying to gain a chemical edge? The popularity of highly caffeinated drinks is a barometer of the competitive stresses on young people. Playing for fun is so 1960. The culture of professional and Olympic sports has filtered down to young people, especially boys – the drinks are becoming a staple of jock culture. The drinks are also used in highly competitive university programs by students pulling all-nighters and then heading to class the next day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supercharged caffeine drinks are the poor man's performance-enhancer. They're handy and legal – caffeine is not banned in the Olympics, though it is monitored for misuse. The “juvenilization” of caffeine has already occurred; it's common to see young people at <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>. Products such as caffeinated jelly “sport beans,” Crackerjack'd (caffeine-infused caramel corn, available in the U.S.) and a chocolate bar infused with a jolt of extra caffeine, may portend the caffeinization of everything, including products commonly ingested by children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Energy drink” may be a misnomer. It lumps caffeine drinks in with safe products like Gatorade that are full of electrolytes and aim at keeping athletes hydrated. Dr. MacDonald and the expert panel say the caffeine drinks are drugs. Their actual effect, because of the caffeine, is to dehydrate, which poses a risk to athletes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are two types of risks. One, the more serious kind, is that the drug will cause heart palpitations or even arrhythmia (loss of the heart's rhythm) and that users will die. More than a score of deaths in Canada and the United States have been linked to caffeine energy drinks, particularly the small “shots” known by names such as 5-Hour Energy. And emergency-room visits because of caffeine overdoses doubled in the U.S. in just four years, to 21,000. Eighteen to 25-year-olds were the biggest group who went to hospital. Dr. MacDonald believes the numbers of dead may be understated, because while coroners look for alcohol or drugs when doing autopsies on youth, they don't look for caffeine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another set of risks are those typically associated with coffee use or addiction: jitteriness, anxiety, sleep problems, mood changes, withdrawal headaches. Children and teens may not realize the addictive quality of the drinks. And addicts who use high-caffeine drinks before a sporting event may need more and more caffeine to achieve the same stimulative effect – increasing the risk of heart problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(A third set of risks involves mixing the drinks with alcohol, which may make heavy drinking seem more rewarding. One in five Canadian students between Grade 7 and 12 mixed the two in the past year, a study found.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A cup of brewed coffee has roughly 135 milligrams of caffeine. The <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span> has set a limit of 180 mg for added caffeine in so-called energy drinks. The small “shot” caffeine drinks have a limit of 200 mg. The expert panel wanted a limit of 80 mg, or slightly less than the maximum daily amount of caffeine recommended for children 10 to 12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How far should the government go to protect Canadians from their own excesses? The panel wanted the products classed as drugs, kept behind drug-store counters, tracked for “adverse events.” They wanted sales to minors banned, just like alcohol and tobacco. The government has, instead, classed the caffeine drinks as a food (the “shots” are deemed natural health products, though they're not natural or healthy), which requires that their ingredients be listed on labels. The labels warn that children should not use the drinks. It's transparency, but is it enough?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one goes to <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> and drinks six coffees in an hour. The risks of caffeine energy drinks are new.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Energy” is cool. How many adults don't look to caffeine to wake up, to get them through the day? Children pick up the cues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Health Canada</span> says it needs more information on who is using the drinks before it takes stronger action. At a minimum, <span class="companylink">Health Canada</span> should work with educators and coaches around the country to get the word out, as the panel urged. Some coaches are already telling their players not to use the drinks. But word isn't getting out fast enough that after the spike in energy comes the fall.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month at the Television Critics Tour in Los Angeles, Fox network boss Kevin Reilly said, “I'm competing with every show on cable. And if you noticed, the top drama on television last year was The Walking Dead.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was delivering two messages. First, the Nielsen ratings that determine the success of a TV show now reflect the solid popularity of cable-only, short-run series. Second (this, in the context of controversy about the blood and gore on Fox's The Following), The Walking Dead proves that popularity sometimes requires lots of blood and gore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Walking Dead (Sunday, AMC, 9 p.m.) returns for the second half of its third season. And it does so as an astonishing success. The show's most recent episode, in December, drew 10.5 million viewers in the United States. That is slightly higher than what The Following is getting on an easily accessible network. People sure love their zombies and the tension here surrounding the tiny band of non-ghouls who roam the U.S. in search of a safe haven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Walking Dead will clash with The 55th Annual Grammy Awards (Sunday, <span class="companylink">CBS</span>, Global, 8 p.m.) and, really, it might have been a contest, predicting which show would garner the most “Ewww!” and “Yuck!” responses. On The Walking Dead: zombies sporting tattered clothes, matted hair and disgusting facial expressions. At the Grammys: music figures who could well be mistaken for zombies – weird clothes, weird hair, extra-weird facial expressions. Except for Taylor Swift, of course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now that <span class="companylink">CBS</span> has decided to crack down on florid, flesh-baring attire and antics, the music-awards shindig could be a tame affair. Among other things, beseeches a leaked <span class="companylink">CBS</span> memo, “Please be sure that buttocks and female breasts are adequately covered.” Also, it notes, “thong-type costumes are problematic.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, in that case, expect a large army of young male viewers to abandon the Grammys. The heck with Rihanna, Sting, Kelly Clarkson, Fun, the Lumineers, Mumford &amp; Sons, Elton John, Swift and Frank Ocean. I mean, why watch the old-timers if Rihanna can't do the cleavage thing? What's the point? I'm just speculating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But seriously, The Walking Dead is both vastly entertaining and serious TV. When we last met them, the survivors, led by a near-deranged Rick (Andrew Lincoln), had incurred the wrath of the fascist-type governor of an area intended to be zombie-free. The stage is now set for an epic battle between those who find succour in the dangerous freedom of a small, roving community and those who want the protection of walls and a charismatic leader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the show's exact direction is kept secret, one of the producers said recently, “There are a lot of humans in serious jeopardy. There's a lot of betrayal. There's a little love. There's a lot of zombie action. And then we get to say goodbye, sadly, to a few more people.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Walking Dead has been relentless in killing off beloved characters, and its grimness is stark. Yet, it seems viewers are not put off by the unexpected departures. They want fear and loathing, and the series delivers. The Grammy Awards, hyped spectacle though it is, can only deliver the loathing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also airing this weekend</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mistrial (Saturday, HBO Canada, 8:15 p.m.) is an oddity from 1996. Made for HBO, it's an aggressive polemic about legal and civil liberties run amok. In part, it's a right-wing revenge fantasy. A jury acquits a dubious community activist who was charged with killing two cops. The detective who brought the case to trial (Bill Pullman) goes crazy. Pulling his gun, he forces the judge to retry the case, under his rules. This doesn't go over well with his bosses and the media. The movie's no masterpiece, but is outrageously provocative.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I had a good time turning 60. So did all my friends. Everyone had a party. My husband's party had a cowboy theme. We all wore jeans (his favourite mode of dress) and chowed down on gourmet chili. A friend of ours (an actual cowboy) recited a poem he'd written, an ode to life and friendship. No riding into the sunset for us. We intended to ride on forever!</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We went to so many 60th birthday parties that I got bored with them. I should have been more appreciative. Now that my friends are turning 65, the celebrations are few and far between. At 60, you can still pretend you're in the middle of your life. At 65, you are officially a Senior Citizen. You can joke about it all you like, but that's a fact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My husband turned 65 in January. “Would you like to have a party?” I asked him in December. “Or should we blow it all on a trip to New York?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he'd think about it. Eventually, I realized what he wanted was for me to shut up about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marketers with condos, magazines and financial services to sell have made strenuous efforts to rebrand the seventh decade of life as a sort of second blush of youth, only with silver hair and more money. The trouble is that no matter how positive your attitude, the indignities start piling up. The other day, my husband went to the drugstore. “You should have been here yesterday,” the sales clerk told him. “It was Seniors Day. Ten per cent off.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The thought of Seniors Day at the drugstore – which now stocks more adult diapers than baby diapers – is undeniably depressing. More depressing still is that people think you're eligible for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My friend Hugh (who looks 10 years younger than he is) remembers those years when he was carded in bars and liquor stores because they thought he was too young. Now he longs to be carded. “Please card me!” he begs silently when he requests a seniors' movie ticket. But no one ever does.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I tell him not to get upset. If you're under 30, everyone over 60 looks the same, and vice-versa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are the luckiest senior citizens the world has ever seen. For most people we know, the lines have blurred between middle age and old age, between our working years and “retirement.” Some of our friends are happily working into their 70s. My husband works with people who are two or three decades younger than he is, some of whom have taken to calling him “Pops.” He loves it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He dreads that every contract will be his last. (I dread it more.) Our friends still work and bike and ski (though not, perhaps, as vigorously as before). To avoid that ugly pattern-baldness look, the men shave their heads. They look just the same as they did 20 years ago – until, one day, they don't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other day, I ran into a guy I've known for almost 30 years. I've always thought of him as very cool. He had started growing a post-Christmas beard. And suddenly he didn't look cool. He looked old. The same thing happened with another man I know, who had a wicked bout with cancer. It drained the vigour out of him. One year he was young, and the next year he was old. And even though he's better now, he'll never be the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After you turn 60, mortality is something you're forced to contemplate, whether you want to or not. The actuarial tables are no longer an abstraction. You can't escape the fact that, no matter what you do, the rest of your life is alarmingly short. It's about the same amount of time you've put in since you were in your 40s, which was the day before yesterday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sixty may be the new 50, and 70 may be the new 60, but 20 or 25 years from now you'll arrive at your final destination pretty much on schedule. And no one has yet rebranded death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why am I so bothered when I see my friends suddenly looking old? Because that could happen to me, too. Maybe it already has. I'd probably be the last to know, because I feel much like the same person I was at 16, 36 or 50. I now know that all old people feel that way. And so we fool ourselves that getting old is something that happens to other people, not us. As my 89-year-old mother-in-law recalls, “I couldn't admit that I was no longer middle-aged until I turned 70.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My husband is a chip off the old block. Last week, he made the mistake of buying seniors' subway tickets. These tickets are massively inconvenient because you have to tear them apart along the perforations. You can't put them in the turnstile like a token and, if you're in a station without a fare box, then what? Worst of all, each ticket is imprinted with a large red “S.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a scarlet letter,” he groused. “Everyone can see it.” He says he's never buying them again.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the draw is set for Sochi and the 2014 men's Olympic hockey tournament. After qualifying tournaments played this past weekend across Europe, Canada is in a pool (Group B) with Finland, Norway and Austria – one perennial medal contender and two just-happy-to-be-there squads.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is the opposite of a Group of Death? Canada gets two virtual walkovers in its first three preliminary-round games and there are two schools of thought about that development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good: In a venue as geographically removed from North America as Sochi is – where the players will need to deal with the effects of travel and a 12-hour time change – it is not a bad thing to face a couple of minnows early on to get their legs under them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bad: While other teams are getting battle-tested by more challenging opponents, Canada will be on cruise control for two-thirds of the preliminary round and could potentially play just the one meaningful game against the Finns before it gets to the one-and-done stage of the tournament.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, all this presupposes that the NHL is actually going Sochi, which will still require some give-and-take at the bargaining table before it becomes a fait accompli.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NHL has meetings scheduled with the <span class="companylink">International Ice Hockey Federation</span> and the <span class="companylink">International Olympic Committee</span> in New York later this week to see if they can come to an agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some time ago, the NHL “shared” with both bodies the conditions under which it will consider participating in the 2014 Olympics so that when the stakeholders come to the bargaining table, there will be no surprises at the 11th hour.The NHL wants a number of concessions, most of them involving access issues, including the right to show images from the Olympic hockey tournament on its own web site, for its own marketing purposes. Indications are that the IIHF is on board with some of the NHL's demands, but there could be issues with the <span class="companylink">IOC</span> – which, as a matter of policy, rarely wants to relinquish control over any aspect of the Games. The fear is that if the <span class="companylink">IOC</span> accedes to the NHL's requests, other governing bodies in other sports, such as FIFA, will ask for even greater concessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a balancing act, kind of a CBA negotiation in microcosm. Deep down, the <span class="companylink">IOC</span> must surely understand that the presence of NHL players at the Olympics greatly enhances the rights fees that they can charge to broadcasters for the Games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On its side, the NHL must just as surely feel an obligation to NBC Sports, which signed a $2-billion deal with the league last year and then found itself without product to put on its cable sports channel during 31/2 months of the season, thanks to the lockout. Competing in Sochi – even if it doesn't commit to South Korea four years later – would be seen as the NHL extending an olive branch to an important sponsor. There are enough good reasons on both sides to see them coming to an agreement, but until it actually happens, there are no guarantees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Sochi, Russia is in Pool A with Slovakia, the United States and the third qualifier, Slovenia, which will compete in the Olympics the first time in its history. In Pool C, Latvia earned the other Olympic qualifying berth and will join the Czech Republic, Sweden and Switzerland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The IIHF is always tweaking and adjusting its format because it wants to be inclusive – and give the second tier of the hockey-playing world a chance to compete against the big boys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Vancouver, Canada had just a so-so record in the round-robin portion of the tournament – a win over Norway, a shootout win over Switzerland and a loss to the United States. In the Olympics, where the three-points-for-a-victory system is in effect, that gave Canada just five out of a possible nine points and forced it to play an extra game in the qualification round (against Germany) before advancing to the quarter-finals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There the Canadians met a rested Russian team that had cruised through the preliminaries – and you probably remember the rest of the story. Canada came out like “a gorilla out of a cage” (Russian goalie Ilya Bryzgalov's colourful post-game description) and crushed the Russians. Afterward, most of the Canadian players agreed – playing the extra game against the Germans actually helped them get untracked in the tournament. From there, they defeated the Slovaks and Americans in subsequent rounds and won the gold medal. Television ratings, in Canada and the United States, reached record levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accordingly, the NHL holds considerable leverage here and if it ultimately decides to give Sochi a pass, it won't be going to South Korea in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Russian players say they will defy the league and play in Sochi, no matter how the talks unfold, but aside from them, it would be a watered-down tournament without the NHL. No amount of warm and fuzzy Olympic profiles about the kids and minor-leaguers that would be playing instead is going to fool the hockey-watching public into thinking this is anything more than a second-rate show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the NHL stays home, about the only thing you can safely predict about the 2014 Olympics is that the gap between international hockey's haves and have-nots will shrink considerably.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On his recent return from Fort McMurray, Alta., from whence he was pursued by an angry landlord and the even angrier older brother of a young lady named Sue, the Brother was appointed Senior Redneck Correspondent of this column.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a good fit. And everybody needs a title, if they can't land a job. As the Brother pointed out, beyond in Ireland the Sister is nearing completion of her PhD and will soon be bossing students around, and it will be all “Doctor this” and “Doctor that” in the environs of a certain university. In the interests of fairness, an appointment as Senior Redneck Correspondent was his due.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides, as the TV racket is now awash in celebration of the hillbilly lifestyle, I can't keep up. Every week, it seems, there's another new show about people who go “yee-haw” with alarming regularity, and their creditable lifestyle is being acclaimed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And since I've been made weak at the knees by the news that Shirley Bassey will perform at the Academy Awards, I couldn't possibly undertake research into such unrefined, plebeian types. It would ruin the mood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Brother is the man for the job. Being simpatico and all of that. Also, he's willing to do it for a bottle of schnapps. He watches and reports. I convey the gist of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First up is Hillbilly Handfishin', a cult favourite on the Animal Planet channel (Thursdays, 10 p.m.). What is it? As the Brother reports, “Welcome to the wild sport of noodling! Watch thrill-thirsty city slickers head to Oklahoma to submerge themselves in murky waters to catch catfish with their bare hands and feet. It's a trip of a lifetime for fish-out-of-water, adventure-seeking city slickers who want nothing more than to surprise themselves – and maybe gross themselves out – by doing things they'd never thought they'd do. Led by Oklahoma hand-fishermen and self-proclaimed hillbillies Skipper Bivins and Trent Jackson, city folk get a taste of the redneck lifestyle by going through the paces of noodling catfish with no fishing rods and no hooks.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Me: “You're making that up!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Brother: “Au contraire, Shirley Bassey fan, what I've just told you is taken directly from the official description of the series. This is an easy job you have here, boyo. It is the absolute truth that this series (which is a little addictive, I must say) involves people standing around in dirty water and tickling fish with their hands. You see, catfish hide in these holes under the water and you reach in and coax them out, if you are skilled in such endeavour.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Me: “Cite me a classic episode.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Brother: “My favourites are Catfish Bites Girl's Butt and Hot Chick Catches Big Fish, the latter having had more views online than the former, which is understandable in today's vulgar world.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I checked: These are actual titles of Hillbilly Handfishin' episodes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next is Bayou Billionaires (CMT Canada, Fridays, 9 p.m.). According to the Brother, “In a modern-day rags-to-riches story, Bayou Billionaires tells the story of the Dowdens of Shreveport, La., a hard-working family of modest means who recently discovered their home sits on the fourth largest deposit of natural gas in the United States. After years of pinching pennies and balancing budgets, the Dowdens are ready to enjoy the finer things in life, sparing no expense.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Me: “Shorter synopsis, please. That sounds like a press release.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Brother: “We gonna make a lotta money and we gonna spend it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Me: “Is that a direct quote?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Brother: “Yes, sir, I tell no lie. I feel like buyin' me a new truck, if I only had the money, instead of this here bottle of schnapps.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Me: “Classic episode?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Brother: “The one where they try to join the local country club. There's Grandpa Dowden, who is 90 years old and keeps saying, ‘I'm 90 and I'm still sexy.' The codger can barely move and he keeps asking the ladies, everyone from the cocktail waitress to the chairwoman of the country club, ‘Are you single?' The mama of the family, whose name is Kitten, drawls on entering the Country Club, ‘I really likes the archy-text-ure of it.' Your readers will not confuse the Dowdens with Downton Abbey, rest assured. Ha ha ha.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Me: “That's enough!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Brother: “But I haven't told you about My Big Redneck Vacation …”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Me: “It can wait. A young lady named Sue called for you.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Brother: “I plans to make her mah waafe and live on the Bayou.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Me: “Good. You're fired.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airing tonight</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The British Academy Film Awards (E! Canada, 8 p.m.) is for those addicted to awards season but too snooty to admit it. The nominations here are almost identical to the Academy Awards list. Murdoch Mysteries (CBC, 9 p.m.), is about this: “Murdoch races to stop a madman threatening Toronto with a deadly gas.” Kinda like what emanates from city hall these days.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span> pitchers and catchers report on Tuesday, and think what that might mean. This is the 20th anniversary season of the last continental title captured by this city, and suddenly spring training is significant not because it means the end of winter drudgery is close at hand or because it offers a respite from competing train-wreck seasons by the Leafs and Raptors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seems significant because the <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span> are all in; enough to make them more than just a trendy pick for a postseason berth and once there – well, who knows how far good pitching can take you in the playoffs? (Actually, the <span class="companylink">San Francisco Giants</span> do.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Beeston, the Blue Jays president and chief executive officer, visited with The Globe and Mail's editorial board last month and related an observation taken away from a presentation he'd attended focusing on the Pan Am Games, which you'd be hard-pressed to know will be held in Toronto in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The one thing the Pan Am Games could really use – whether or not you believe in them – is a winning professional sports team here; where people start getting behind sports and thinking in those terms,” Beeston said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think we've got this mentality right now in this city of being losers. And what we need to do is have a mentality more of winners, where everybody is happy, where everyone's smiling; where everybody's got their chest pumped out a little bit and can feel good about it. To me it's critical. There's a social responsibility to running a sports franchise and it all gets down to winning. I believe that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, 2009, The Globe and Mail took a look at the North American cities with four professional franchises – yes, we counted the Toronto Argonauts as a pro franchise; it's the least we could do given the fact we were counting the <span class="companylink">Detroit Lions</span>, too – in order to see which city had the best combined regular-season winning percentage and satisfy our worst fears about which one had the worst. Boston led with .625; Toronto was second-last at .457 just ahead of woeful Washington, D.C. at .396. Fast-forward to 2013 and the number of cities with four pro teams had dropped to 13 from 14 (the Atlanta Thrashers left for Winnipeg) and Toronto is still second-worst at .442.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto is still ahead of Minneapolis-St. Paul at .419. San Francisco-Oakland's teams (including the <span class="companylink">San Jose Sharks</span>) had a .574 winning percentage to lead the group, through Saturday.San Francisco and Oakland built their edge this past season on the fact that both baseball teams racked up 94-68 records, and given the excitement surrounding the <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span>' off-season acquisitions of R.A. Dickey, Jose Reyes, Mark Buehrle, Josh Johnson, Melky Cabrera, Maicer Izturis and Emilio Bonifacio, coupled with the anticipated return to health of Jose Bautista, it will be hard to limit expectations of something similar from the <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beeston believes attendance could hit three million, and in his meeting with The Globe spoke boldly about the Jays rejoining what he calls “the big-market caucus,” where the team's financial and collective-bargaining sensibilities are more in line with teams such as the <span class="companylink">New York Yankees</span> than the <span class="companylink">Kansas City Royals</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So now all that needs to happen is for the <span class="companylink">Blue Jays</span> to win – what? – 95 games? All that needs to happen is for Reyes, Brett Lawrie, J.P. Arencibia, Dickey and Edwin Encarnacion to make it through the World Baseball Classic without getting hurt; for Bautista's wrist to hold up and free-agent-to-be Johnson to be up to pitching in the American League; for somebody to close and for there to be nothing more to Cabrera's dalliance with performance-enhancing drugs and for Buehrle to keep body and soul intact through a year without his beloved Staffordshire Terrier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, pitchers and catchers are finally reporting. In a city shy of marquee players let alone marquee hopes, the time has never been more perfect.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cascading revelations of senators behaving badly have once again ignited calls for the Upper House to either be reformed or abolished.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reform is difficult; abolition impossible. But what might be possible is to change the culture of the place, along with some rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saskatchewan Senator Pamela Wallin, a Conservative, has joined the list of senators who appear to live primarily in the national capital but who nonetheless claim living expenses. Other alleged miscreants include Conservatives Mike Duffy and Patrick Brazeau and Liberal Mac Harb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wallin rebutted questions raised by the NDP about her real place of residence. “Saskatchewan is my home and I have owned property there for many years,” she said in a statement. “I work hard in Saskatchewan, in Ottawa and across this country to fulfill my duties as a senator.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Constitution Act of 1867 states that a senator “shall be resident in the province for which he is appointed.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as Liberal Senator Colin Kenny points out, there simply isn't any written definition of what residency means: whether it entails living in the home province a minimum number of days, filing income tax from that province, having a health card or driver's licence, or some other criteria “It's been left very vague,” he said in an interview. “I can think of no legislation or regulations that define it precisely.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, it wasn't much of an issue. In Quebec, for example, senators must live or have property in the district – there are 24 of them – they represent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The constitutional scholar Ned Franks chuckles that, back in the day, each Quebec senator would own a sliver of land in his district, which he would then pass on to his successor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truth is that the Senate “is a gentleman's club with some women in it,” Prof. Franks said in an interview. Rules are few and the honour system prevails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is one thing, though, for a senator to have his province in his heart rather than on his driver's licence; it is another thing to claim tens of thousands of dollars of living expenses every year, as though you were taking the red-eye back home every Friday night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Duffy and Ms. Wallin are former journalists; they should know better than anyone how people react when politicians are thought to be fiddling with the rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Senate's committee on internal economy finds that Mr. Duffy and Ms. Wallin are not, in fact, permanent residents of the provinces they represent, and that they were not entitled to file living expenses, then Prime Minister Stephen Harper will have to decide whether to expel them from caucus, as Senator Patrick Brazeau was for alleged physical and sexual abuse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Then there is Mr. Harb, a former Ottawa alderman and Ottawa MP who now says he lives in Pembroke.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond that, the time may have come for the Senate to put its rules in writing. Over the years, a sufficient number of senators have abused the honour system to have dishonoured the system itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In every respect, that which is implicit should be made explicit. The committee of internal economy could begin by demanding receipts for expenses – all of them. A culture of accountability must replace the club culture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If residency is important, one way to enforce it might be to proceed with Conservative legislation that would see senators elected to fixed terms. A candidate's ties to the province would no doubt factor in voters' decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP and many commentators believe that the Senate has become so irrelevant and rife with abuse that it should be abolished. Mr. Harper, when he referred his Senate reform legislation to the Supreme Court, asked the court to rule on the constitutional requirements for abolishing the Senate entirely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But both Prof. Franks and Senator Kenny suspect the Constitution doesn't permit such a thing. Canada has a federal parliament composed of a lower chamber that represents the popular will and an upper chamber that represents the regional interest. Abolishing the Senate, they believe, may be as impossible as abolishing the House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tempting though the thought might be some days in both cases.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teaches history at Brock University</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right-wing fringe parties come and go in Britain. It's hard to predict just how long the United Kingdom Independence Party (popularly known as UKIP) will survive. But, right now, the party and its leader, Nigel Farage, are making life miserable for Prime Minister David Cameron.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They've succeeded in putting the question of Britain's membership in the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> back on the national agenda. Before taking office, Mr. Cameron had promised that the Conservatives “would not keep banging on about Europe.” But now Mr. Farage and his Europhobic supporters have harried Mr. Cameron into announcing that a referendum will be held to determine whether Britain stays in or leaves the EU.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Farage and his party – whom the Prime Minister once dismissed as “fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists” – have achieved this remarkable coup without ever having won a seat in the British House of Commons. But, ironically, they do have a cadre of 12 members in the <span class="companylink">European Parliament</span> in Strasbourg and Brussels (thanks to proportional representation, which is kind to fringe parties). From those bastions of the European unity project, they witness the machinations of the Euro beast and dispatch warnings about its malign intentions to their constituents back home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UKIP's influence, though, lies in the fact that it has become a surrogate voice for Conservative backbenchers suspicious of Mr. Cameron's modernizing agenda. When UKIP's message is parroted in the House, Mr. Cameron's discomfort is palpable. He combats with confidence the socialist menace across the aisle, but he twists around awkwardly as he tries to quell the rumbles of Tory dissent behind him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UKIP is opposed to bullet trains shattering the peace of the English countryside. So are many Tory MPs. It condemns the government's gay marriage bill. So do many Tory MPs; on Tuesday, half of the Conservative caucus snubbed the Prime Minister and voted against it. (Perhaps the only UKIP position that doesn't resonate with the Tory right is the bizarre defence of necrophilia offered by Olly Neville, the former leader of the party's youth wing.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The party's raison d'être, though, is its opposition to Britain's membership in the EU, and again it speaks for many in the Conservative Party. UKIP points to the steady erosion of British sovereignty in a host of areas. Right now, it's exploiting the fact that, next year, a change in European regulations will allow Romanians and Bulgarians to settle in Britain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Farage demands that the U.K. reclaim control of its borders, the Cameron government is planning an advertising campaign designed to convince potential immigrants that Britain is a dreary place, with a depressed economy and appalling weather. “You're better off staying in Romania” is the gist of the message.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite all his political problems, Mr. Cameron retains the persona of the happy warrior. And that's maybe because he has a cunning plan to defang Mr. Farage and his party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed referendum, it should be noted, will not take place until 2017 – after the next general election. Mr. Cameron will argue that voting for UKIP will erode the Tory vote, paving the way for Labour Leader Ed Miliband – who's being craftily evasive about the Europe question – to win the keys to 10 Downing St. If you want a referendum on Europe, Mr. Cameron will say, you have to vote Conservative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a short-term electoral strategy, it might just work. But then will come the hard part: negotiating an arrangement acceptable to the British people with European partners who are increasingly impatient with what they see as the U.K.'s lack of enthusiasm for nearly all aspects of European federation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like several of his predecessors – Harold Wilson and Margaret Thatcher come to mind – Mr. Cameron will strive for an arrangement in which Britain enjoys the benefits of a free market in Europe, while cherry-picking the concomitant obligations of EU membership. He won't succeed, and Nigel Farage is likely to still be around, urging that Britain reclaim its national independence and leave the continent to its own devices. And there'll still be a section of the Conservative Party paying heed to his words.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scent of a baby is intoxicating to most people. Presented with an infant, they will invariably remark upon how wonderful it smells. Just how babies have been able to accomplish this without the costly intervention of perfumers such as <span class="companylink">Dolce &amp; Gabbana</span> is one of the great mysteries of the universe. But all that is in the process of changing. There is a scramble by perfume manufacturers to impress notions of vanity upon even the very young.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">D&amp;G, the internationally renowned fashion house from Italy, has launched an ad campaign using baby models with their “parents” – who look more like top lingerie models – in an effort to peddle a new eau de toilette for the tiny-tot market. According to <span class="companylink">Dolce &amp; Gabbana</span> (the company's cofounder, the G in D&amp;G), the scent was inspired by “the softness of baby skin, the freshness of baby breath, a mother's sweet hug, [and] the first smile.” Along with the $45 per bottle they charge, presumably.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">D&amp;G is not alone. They are just the latest to join in the fight for market share for clients in diapers. Similar offerings for baby-friendly, alcohol-free formulas and “light” scents come from Burberry, Bulgari and other luxury brands. Johnson's also offers a baby cologne at a much lower price. Understanding that their real competition is the baby's natural, intrinsic scent, these makers claim only to be enhancing a baby's beautiful natural smell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why bother? Instead of daubing babies with a strange brew of (in Burberry's case) “citrus fruit rind, fresh wild mint and rhubarb jelly” – and who knows what else – these companies should be doing the converse of this. They should be trying to replicate, and bottle, the scent of a baby for the adult market. It could prove to be far more lucrative. This is one instance where our culture of infantilization could be a good thing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This federal government has a penchant for history, driven by a passion for dates and commemorations, giving us plenty to celebrate for the next several years. As a history buff, I can relate. My favourite calendars are the ones that describe This Day in History. My pop quizzes are riddled with Significant Dates in Politics.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it's a curious obsession for a government to equate historical commemoration with the celebration of citizenship. It speaks to the determined efforts of the Conservatives to push back on the post-1960s definition of Canadian citizenship as a modern and multicultural entity to one anchored in symbols of the past. And it refocuses the emphasis from broader social history to one driven by military deeds, political leaders and historical dates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are worthy markers to reflect on. And this shift may lift some of the cumbersome baggage of multiculturalism for those of us who don't identify as hyphenated Canadians. But how about we celebrate some dates that have less to do with the British Crown or Great Men, and more with who we are as Canadians?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's start with 2013. This year marks the 100th anniversary of an important milestone: In 1913, the number of immigrants to Canada peaked at 400,000. It was a high-water mark until the onset on fighting in Europe brought an end to the biggest boom in Canadian immigration, before or since. For millions of Canadians, this is the era that started their family experience in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those families is my own. My paternal grandfather arrived at Pier 21 in Halifax in 1913 as a young boy from Italy, en route to Montreal. For him, as for the vast majority who travelled across the oceans before the First World War, it would be a one-way ticket with no looking back. In many ways, his experience was similar to that of my children's other first ancestor, who settled in Montreal in the 1680s with no thought of ever going home to his native France.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This story is a variation on a theme that so many Canadians share. Although my grandfather kept his traditions through language, faith and, of course, food, he built a life as a Canadian, making sure his children adopted the mores and values of the country they were born into. He worked his whole life for <span class="companylink">Canadian Pacific Railway</span>, took in the less fortunate during the Great Depression, kept his head down and his Canadian loyalty strong during the war years. He was proud of his heritage but had no yearning for the old country, and waved no national flags. He refused to reveal any partisan political preferences (the secret ballot was his most treasured right), something I find a good rule of thumb as a political scientist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In between this government's fixation on monarchical and military legacies, and past celebrations of cultural differences, lies an important gap of recognizing Canadians for who they are: the product of a distinct life experience on the ground, one that shifts and moves based on region, language and context but is rooted in similar family histories, legacies and aspirations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, this year, my extended family is marking an Important Date in Canadian History with our own 100-year milestone. With the tight budget situation on Parliament Hill, we aren't planning to ask <span class="companylink">Heritage Canada</span> for a contribution. Still, the Conservative government might want to consider that celebrating citizenship also means a remembrance of Canadians' own diverse historical inheritance, which contributes to defining who we are and who we aspire to be.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am not alone in having an unusual phobia. I have a friend who is freaked out by children whispering. Just children. I once met a girl who can't let velvet touch her skin. One of my old co-workers recently told me about someone who is afraid of buttons. Not “doesn't like” buttons, but actually fears them. My condition technically isn't a phobia; it's what's called a disgust response, which can cause similar anxiety, but is based on being irrationally and extremely revolted by something rather than fearing it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In search of some context and advice, I reached out to Martin Antony, who is a professor of psychology at <span class="companylink">Ryerson University</span>, and author of The Anti-Anxiety Workbook. He told me that sometimes these things have an obvious genesis (one woman who is afraid of bananas was force-fed them as a child), but more often the root cause is unknown. He said that disgust responses to food are relatively normal and asked questions that made me feel understood: Was there a hierarchy of fear, i.e., are some fruits worse than others? (Answer: Absolutely – apple is worst, and next would be pear). Is it more taste or texture? (Texture. I am actually fine with almost all fruit in juice form or baked in a dessert). Could it be a germ thing? (No – I would rather lick a trashcan than eat a tangerine). Of course, I have contemplated such questions ad nauseam over the years, but it was different hearing them from a professional.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operation Big Mac Attack</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Antony told me that if I were coming to him for treatment we would embark on a program of gradual exposure, beginning with the “lesser evil” fruits and working our way up. I attempted a more efficient version of this technique at home, though part of me viewed it as unnecessary time spent in the presence of the enemy. Exposure No. 1 was placing an apple on the table while I watched TV. I was able to do it, but felt very anxious and vaguely nauseated the whole time. (No, I am not kidding.) Exposure No. 2: I sliced an apple and felt like peeling my skin off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the week of confronting my fear was almost up, I summoned every bit of rational, logical thought in my head and I ate an apple. Okay fine, I took a bite of one (remember – dirty diaper!). It was both not as bad and far worse than I thought it could be. I did it in close proximity to a public garbage can. Somehow this felt safer, like I could leave the experience (and the evidence) behind when I was done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I imagine the professionals would tell me that truly getting over this sort of fear takes commitment and time and can't be solved in a few self-administered therapy sessions. Facing my fear may have caused some regression, since now I can induce an anxiety reaction simply by thinking back to the bite. Clearly I didn't conquer my fear or come anywhere close, but I did prove to myself (and to all of you other fruit-o-phobes – I know you're out there) that it is possible to temporarily put mind over matter. Or, in this case, over McIntosh.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Certain circumstances happen and that's what make rivalries rivalries. We don't talk about that any more because that's never going to happen again.” Hard-nosed <span class="companylink">Buffalo Sabres</span> forward Patrick Kaleta on the “circumstance” that helped make the <span class="companylink">Boston Bruins</span> a rival – Milan Lucic's mammoth hit on Sabres goaltender Ryan Miller in November, 2011, that was not immediately avenged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">******************</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SABRES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rivalries run deep in Buffalo</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one happy side effect of the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> lockout – some say the only one – is the intense competition produced by the compacted, intra-conference schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that, in turn, cranks the heat up on the best regular-season games of all – those between fierce rivals. The <span class="companylink">Buffalo Sabres</span>, for example, played their second game in 11 days against the <span class="companylink">Boston Bruins</span> on Sunday night and will meet them again on Friday in Buffalo. In between, they play the <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span> on Tuesday, who are still considered a rival by the more veteran Sabres thanks to some playoff battles several years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This stretch may be just what the Sabres need. Their fans are getting angry thanks to the Sabres' slow start due to their poor defensive play. But the Sabres did manage to beat the Bruins in their first meeting this season and took a 3-2 win Saturday against the <span class="companylink">New York Islanders</span> into Sunday's game against them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Certain circumstances help the rivalry factor but for us the biggest as of now is Boston,” said Sabres forward Patrick Kaleta, a Buffalo native who knows a thing or two about his team's rivalries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most teams have at least two, with an informal survey of several Sabres listing the Bruins, <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span> and the Senators in that order. Kaleta's enemies list is a bit longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Boston, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal,” Kaleta, 26, said. “Growing up a Sabres fan, I never liked those teams anyway. Luckily, I was drafted by the Sabres and still play for the Sabres so I still have the same hatred for those teams.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing Kaleta and his teammates agree on is the same factors go into a good rivalry: A couple of good playoff battles or geographical proximity or special circumstances such as a big brawl or one player doing something particularly nasty to an important player.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bruins qualify on two of three counts. They knocked off the Sabres in the 2010 playoffs (the last time the Sabres qualified) but most of all hard feelings linger from a hit by Bruins bruiser Milan Lucic in November, 2011, that knocked goaltender Ryan Miller out for eight games with a concussion. It also didn't help that none of the Sabres rushed to battle Lucic after the hit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That gets your hair up,” Miller said of Lucic's contribution to the rivalry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's a lot of talk about Boston. We didn't get in the playoffs last year but [the regular-season] games with them was our most intense series.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miller says the geographical rivalries will always linger but others will wax and wane. He still remembers the hard-nosed playoff battles with the Senators but noted only Jason Spezza, Chris Phillips, Daniel Alfredsson and one or two others from those teams are still playing in Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They had a lot of turnover,” Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As soon as you turn over a little things die down. But you do hear about rivalries. When guys come on to our team, they know who the tough games are going to be against.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Sabres, one team that will always represent one of those games is the Maple Leafs. They have not faced each other in the playoffs much – the last time being 1999 when the Sabres won the Eastern Conference final in five games – but having your own arena fill up with Leaf fans several times a year keeps things boiling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When they play here, it seems half the building is wearing Leaf jerseys,” Sabres forward Jason Pominville said. “I still have no idea how they manage to get that many tickets but they do somehow and it makes it exciting.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">**********</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MLSE NO HAPPY PLACE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The executive suite at Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd., will bear watching in the coming weeks as the firing of Toronto Maple Leafs president Brian Burke was not the only recent departure. It seems the media giants <span class="companylink">BCE Inc</span>., and <span class="companylink">Rogers Communications Inc</span>., are not hesitating to throw their weight around now that they own 75 per cent of MLSE.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also leaving were Robin Brudner, MLSE's executive vice-president, general counsel and corporate secretary, and Patti-Anne Tarlton, vice-president, live entertainment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While at MLSE, Brudner was one of the most powerful female sports executives in North America. Sources say neither departure was without friction. There may be some hard feelings about the size of a bonus. As general counsel, Brudner would have done a lot of work on the $1.3-billion sale to BCE and Rogers and a bonus in excess of $1-million would not have been out of line, according to one insider. Both Brudner, who is taking time out for her family, and Tarlton, who is now with <span class="companylink">Ticketmaster</span>, declined to comment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">NHL</span>, IOC IN OLYMPIC STAND-OFF</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">NHL</span> and the <span class="companylink">NHL Players' Association</span> will meet Thursday and Friday in New York with the IOC and the <span class="companylink">International Ice Hockey Federation</span> with the hope of making progress toward an agreement to participate in the 2014 Sochi Olympics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actually, the league and the union have a rather ambitious schedule in mind for this week, as they also plan to discuss <span class="companylink">NHL</span> realignment and finalize the language in the new collective agreement. At this point, though, it looks like the only item on their agenda expected to get finished is the final version of the collective agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Sochi Games only 12 months away, an agreement on <span class="companylink">NHL</span> participation needs to be done quickly. However, that will be difficult despite the players' willingness to go because of several issues, none of which were helped by IIHF president René Fasel. He took an obvious shot at NHL commissioner Gary Bettman in an interview on CBC television, saying, “I think Gary has no other choice, he has to come to Sochi,” and later said a barrier to an agreement might be “ego from some people in North America.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That had even NHLPA executives shaking their heads and should make for an interesting session on Thursday when Bettman sits down with Fasel, NHLPA executive director Donald Fehr and representatives from the IOC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The players may be eager to keep playing in the Olympics but they do agree with the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> owners, who think they get nothing in return for interrupting their regular-season schedule. They think there needs to be some giving on the part of the IOC and IIHF on several fronts, including access to players' and <span class="companylink">NHL</span> teams' regular doctors, insurance, a cut of the revenue they bring in and the schedule regarding both Olympic participation and other international competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latter issue concerns Olympic orientation camps and the dormant World Cup of Hockey. The <span class="companylink">NHL</span> and the players want to make sure the Olympic orientation camps held by each country the summer before the games are shorter and less intense than the week-long affairs in the past. They also want to get an agreement on having the World Cup serve as the major international hockey competition every two years in an Olympic off-year, probably in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realignment remains a hot issue with the owners but the players want to make sure their concerns about excessive travel and equal chances to make the playoffs are met before they give their required permission. One thing different this time around is whatever plan is presented to the NHL governors for their approval will have already been agreed to by the players. Last year, the governors approved a plan only to see it shot down by the players.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We've been discussing alignment with the union over a period of time since we agreed on the new [collective agreement],” NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said in an e-mail message Sunday. “Yes, our final recommendation in terms of approach for next year will be brought to the [governors] for its review and approval.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flyers at Leafs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the first game between these teams since the big James van Riemsdyk-Luke Schenn trade. Okay, not exactly Wayne Gretzky returns to Edmonton but the Leafs are the early winners thanks to van Riemsdyk's, above, seven goals. They also need a win to shore up that awful 1-4 home record.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rangers at Bruins</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time they met, Rangers winger Marian Gaborik had a hat trick, including the overtime winner on Jan. 23, a win that was supposed to right them after a slow start. It didn't happen and now the Rangers need another win to get moving, only they're 1-3 on the road.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sabres at Senators</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is still some life in this rivalry and the Sabres will be fighting hard to get their increasingly annoyed fans off their backs. Only goaltender Ryan Miller is keeping the Sabres afloat thanks to their poor defensive work, especially on faceoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday, 7:30 p.m., Sportsnet East</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senators at Penguins</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Neal and Evgeni Malkin, above, combined to knock off the Senators in their previous meeting by collaborating on a goal in regulation time and then both scoring in the shootout for a 2-1 win.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday, 7 p.m., TSN, RDS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharks at <span class="companylink">Blackhawks</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A nice rivalry in the making here. When they met last week, they were both at the top of the Western Conference and the <span class="companylink">Blackhawks</span> took a 5-3 decision to remain without a regulation loss. But there were fireworks with Chicago's Duncan Keith piling up the penalty minutes for going after Sharks forward Andrew Desjardins for his head shot on Jamal Mayers.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the untapped energy potential in the Arctic, an increase in offshore exploration and production is inevitable. It is also in many respects welcome, benefiting the region's economy. However, it is crucial that it occur in a way that is sensitive to an extremely fragile ecosystem. Canada, as incoming chair of the Arctic Council, can help ensure necessary safeguards are in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anxieties over the ability to access oil in the region were stoked by recent events, including Shell's decision last fall to postpone its $4.5-billion effort to drill in Arctic waters off Alaska following problems with sea ice, accidents on its two Arctic drilling rigs, and a malfunction of its environmental protection equipment. That was in the summer. Imagine what could go wrong in winter, with ice floes and fierce and unpredictable winds.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, <span class="companylink">Total SA</span>, the French oil producer, recently halted work in the Arctic. Christophe de Margerie, Total's chief executive, said the risk of an oil spill was too great for the environmentally sensitive area. “Oil on Greenland would be a disaster,” he told the Financial Times, expressing concern a leak would damage the company's reputation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Arctic Council</span> has a unique opportunity to establish best practices and manage the complex risks of drilling in the North. It should consider putting more teeth in its draft agreement on oil-spill preparedness and response, which members are expected to sign in May. The agreement has some laudable provisions. It endorses the general principle of “polluter pays,” sets out the obligation to protect the marine environment and to promote conservation, and the need for each country to have a 24-hour monitoring and response system to reports of oil spills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Canada, as incoming council chair, should use its leadership to press for better oil-spill technology, given the unique conditions in an area that still sees lots of ice, as well as the legal obligations of polluters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This last point is particularly important. The council's mandate, after all, includes protection of the environment. There should be explicit wording to ensure oil companies are responsible for the cost of cleaning up spills – and that they have the equipment, experience and technology to address this challenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Arctic contains as much as a quarter of the world's untapped oil reserves. Development will bring benefits to the people who live there, and help them achieve economic self-sufficiency. However, due regard must be given to conservation of the Arctic environment, to its unique marine life, and to the need to adequately prepare for the complexities of drilling under the ice. Even a minor oil spill could have major environmental consequences.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists use the Greek omega system to indicate where a double bond is located on a fatty acid. Omega-3s have their first double bond located three carbons away from the end; the first double bond of omega-6s is located six carbons away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both types of fatty acids help form cell membranes, keep our vision sharp and play a role in heart health. They also help make eicosanoids, potent chemical messengers that are instrumental in the body's immune and inflammatory responses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But because our bodies can't make omega-3s and omega-6s, they are considered essential nutrients and must come from our diet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why linoleic acid (LA) is an essential omega-6 fatty acid and, when consumed, is used to synthesize other omega-6s. Many studies have found that higher intakes of LA are linked with a lower risk of heart disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Men aged 19 to 50 need 17 grams of LA per day; women require 12 g. Older men should consume 14 g per day, while older women need 11 g.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good sources of LA include nuts, seeds, sunflower oil, safflower oil and corn oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is the fatty acid used to make other omega-3s in the body. Studies suggest that higher intakes of ALA may protect you from heart disease, especially in people who don't eat much fish. ALA has also been shown to decrease C-reactive protein in the blood, a marker of inflammation that's strongly tied to heart attack and stroke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women require 1,100 mg of ALA each day; men need 1,600 mg. The best food sources include:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• ground flax seed (2 tbsp = 2,400 mg)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• flax oil (1 tsp = 2,400 mg)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• chia seeds (2 tbsp = 3,600 mg)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• walnuts (7 halves = 1,280 mg)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• walnut oil (1 tsp = 470 mg)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• soybeans, canola oil and foods fortified with ALA (e.g. milk, soy beverages, eggs) also provide ALA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also two other important omega-3s, which are found in fatty fish such as salmon, trout, sardines and herring: docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Both are strongly linked to cardiovascular protection, while DHA also plays a role in brain and eye function.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no official recommended intake for DHA and EPA. However, many experts advise consuming at least a combined total of 500 to 1,000 mg per day (that's on top of the daily recommended intake of ALA), which is easily achieved by eating six to 12 ounces of salmon each week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You may have heard it's important to eat the right balance, or ratio, of omega-3s and omega-6s in your diet. Many experts believe it's actually more important to consume the recommended levels of each type of fat, rather than focus on ratios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most of us, that means increasing our omega-3 intake.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">BlackBerry</span> Z10 is the most recent device driven by an effort to create a seamless integration of work and play. The Z10's “Hub” and “Flow” features are designed to allow you to move back and forth between these two worlds: Send in that late report while still playing a game of Angry Birds or confirm an appointment while watching the latest blockbuster.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one time, it was thought that such technologies would free us from work and give us more time for leisure. But, as is obvious to anyone who owns a tablet or a smartphone, work ends up following us to the golf course and to the sidelines of our kid's soccer game. Bosses and managers know play also follows us to work. Peter Cohan, a contributor to Forbes.com, estimates that people using <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> while at work is cutting U.S. productivity by 9.4 per cent, resulting in $1.4-trillion in lost profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This confusion between work and play, facilitated by increasingly ubiquitous and embedded technologies, led media theorist Julian Kücklich to coin the term “playbour,” which highlights the overlooked union of play and labour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyday experiences of playbour can be found in popular games such as Minecraft and Farmville. As the name suggests, players of Minecraft take on the role of a miner to unearth minerals and other building materials. The highly addictive Farmville prompts players to plant crops, build farms and run the harvest. The profusion of similar “time management games” such as Diner Dash, Supermarket Mania and Sally's Spa allow you to replicate the harried life of a restaurant manager, grocery clerk or pedicurist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tremendous popularity of these games suggests something more is going on than a muddling of work time and free time. Instead, we may be at a technological tipping point where the critical balance between labour and leisure is lost. Rather than freeing us from work, technology turns everything into work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the decades, much has been made about the way new technology is affecting employment. Recently, <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> professors Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, the authors of the new book Race Against the Machine, have argued that advances in robotics, voice recognition technology and online commerce are to blame for the jobless recovery, because these machines have replaced millions of workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his book Shop Class as Soulcraft: An Inquiry into the Value of Work, Matthew Crawford takes a more philosophical view, worrying that the waning of work, particularly manual labour, leads to a potential loss of the deep spiritual satisfaction we gain through “the experience of making things and fixing things.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what about the spiritual consequences of the loss of free time, leisure and play? More and more, time with our friends, families and even by ourselves is mediated by devices initially designed for work, such as the newest iteration of the <span class="companylink">BlackBerry</span>. Even when we do manage to pull ourselves away from our screens to exercise, we end up “training” on treadmills, as though we were animals turning a wheel in some preindustrial factory. We spend our time “working out” rather than playing out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The critical role of play has a long history in Western civilization. Way back in the 4th century BC, Aristotle wrote extensively on the importance of leisure. The ancient Greek word for leisure is schole, from which we get “school.” At least for Aristotle, leisure was supposed to be time to think about higher things, gain insight, engage in relaxed contemplation and consider the meaning of life. Work was to satisfy the lower goods of the appetites and leisure for the satisfaction of the higher goods of community, spirit and mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, of course, we are much more likely to associate leisure with the satisfaction of so-called lower goods. Perhaps that's why we end up recreating work environments in our games. If play is being eclipsed by technology, all we may be left with is the strange drudgery of playbour. All told, we need to rethink the work-play balance as it teeters back and forth in our technological society.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today I want to talk about my problem with Let's Talk Day – a worthwhile Canadian initiative that is designed to build awareness of mental-health issues. You've probably seen the TV spots. One of them features a young woman in a business suit phoning her office to change her voice-mail message. She won't be in. She puts down the phone and begins to weep. The message is that mental-health issues (not problems – issues) affect millions of people just like you. So let's erase the stigma! For every message you text or tweet today, Bell will donate five cents to the cause.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, good for Bell. But the problem with normalizing mental illness (sorry – mental health disorders) is that it blurs the line between mild to moderate issues and severe disorders. The people who miss work from time to time, while deserving of compassion and support, are in a completely different situation than those who can't hold a job because of the voices in their heads telling them to throw themselves in front of a subway train. And the harm we do to those people is one of the great injustices of our age. So let's talk about them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1950s, Canada had almost 60,000 long-term psychiatric beds. Today, we have about 6,000. The number of people with severe mental illness – perhaps 2 or 3 per cent of the population – has not declined. So where did they go? They went to the streets and into the jails. We have replaced one institution (mental asylums) with another (prisons). Some people think this is progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot was wrong with the old asylums. But mass deinstitutionalization has been a tragedy. It has left tens of thousands of helpless people to fend for themselves. They suffer from serious psychotic conditions, including schizophrenia. They are a permanent feature of the urban landscape. Despite the arguments of patients' rights groups, not all can be treated in community mental health clinics. A large number don't even know they're sick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Richard O'Reilly, a former president of the Ontario Psychiatric Association, points out, every other area of medicine gives priority treatment to the sickest people. The sole exception is for mental illness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The harm these people do to themselves and others is devastating. According to E. Fuller Torrey, a leading U.S. treatment advocate, the untreated mentally ill commit 10 per cent of all homicides. They constitute 20 per cent of prison populations and 30 per cent of the homeless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hospitalizing or treating people against their will is an explosive subject. But families with seriously ill daughters or brothers know it can be the only way to save someone from themselves. And sometimes the only way for people to lead semi-normal lives is to stay on medication for life. They deserve the right to be well. But families and other advocates for compulsory treatment face a powerful array of opposition, including civil-rights groups, anti-psychiatry activists and “consumer/survivors” who feel they've been victimized by the system. Some psychiatrists, psychologists, sociologists and other professionals reject the biomedical model of psychiatric illness altogether – and some of these people run mental-health services. They argue that the roots of psychiatric illness lie in social and family factors. They think that recovery, even from psychotic illness, is possible without drug treatment and that the real key to wellness is self-empowerment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is like telling someone with metastatic cancer that she can get better once she takes charge of her life and starts hoping hard enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So let's talk about the disaster we've created – and what we need to do to fix it. That conversation is long overdue.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The extraordinary gender change in Canadian political leadership has arrived without much fanfare. But we've never seen anything like it. Just a few years ago, it was hard to find a female premier anywhere; they were a political subspecies.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overnight, it has all changed. Now, women run much of the federation. They are at the controls in five provinces – including every big one in the country – and one territory. There's Kathleen Wynne, who was sworn in as the Premier of Ontario on Monday. There's Alison Redford in Alberta, Christy Clark in British Columbia and Pauline Marois in Quebec. Add to them Kathy Dunderdale in Newfoundland and Labrador. And don't forget Eva Aariak in Nunavut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There used to be a perception that women weren't tough enough for the job. Any of these women could surely kick that canard out the door. But will they bring about much change to the political culture? It's a good bet they'll bring a greater degree of integrity and morality to politics. Not that they'll be squeaky clean. Some of the aforementioned face questions of ethical breaches. But given the male precedent, the task of forging a higher degree of public respect for the system should be achievable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A greater test will be whether any of the female premiers can become national figures – nation builders. We've had provincial leaders before who were larger than the territories they led – men like Peter Lougheed, William Davis and Tommy Douglas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It being an important time for nation-building, such heavyweights are needed now. The female premiers, for example, will play a pivotal role in discussions about national pipeline construction, a national energy strategy and whether Canada should take care of its own energy needs first or let the resources go to the highest bidder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking of morality in politics, the matter of Senate reform is currently on many minds. Support from the premiers is key. Their role is essential for the future of our health-care system, national economic questions and, with Quebec having elected a separatist government, unity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for any of our first ministers hoping to gain national standing, the task is now more difficult. The best platforms for premiers to showcase themselves have been taken away. These were the first ministers' summit conferences with the prime minister. Stephen Harper's federal government has ended the tradition, which began in the 1930s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pierre Trudeau held about 20 such conferences. Brian Mulroney hosted 14. In keeping with their desire for complete control of the agenda, today's Conservatives have had just one. Mr. Harper doesn't want feuding first ministers around his table. It's understandable, in a way. While some summits were successes, others saw premiers grandstanding, beating up on Ottawa or ganging up for a money grab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But past problems, many of which stemmed from constitutional warring, do not mean the summits should be abandoned. They are a nation-building challenge to be faced, not dodged. It is normal practice for leaders of major organizations to meet with their big constituent parts to thrash out problems and priorities. Mr. Harper shows skill and moxie at international forums and would be capable of the same here. He excuses himself by saying he meets often with the premiers separately. That's true. But other prime ministers did that as well as bring all the premiers together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As commentator Bruce Anderson has observed, the big meetings help create a sustained discussion on how the different parts of Canada work together. Something important has been lost, he says. The very fact that the conferences were held exposed the premiers to the national interest and created pressure on them to act in that interest. The parochial actors were separated from the national ones. Stars were born, as were villains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With all the new female premiers, with pressing national issues, with the country in need of a clearer sense of direction, it's time to renew our national summits. Let's see what the women can bring to the table. Let's see if they can be more effective nation builders than the men.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘Major crimes mixed with medical issues” is how CBC describes Cracked (CBC, 9 p.m.), its new cop drama that has been running since early January.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The description suggests an awkward symmetry, and Cracked is certainly that. It's well-meaning and features some excellent acting, but it's a shambles as TV drama. Often predictable to the point of ludicrousness, it is too heavy on the “medical issues” front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show captures, in a nutshell, CBC's big, self-inflicted quandary – apparently it won't air a drama that doesn't have a public service announcement as part of the texture of the show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gist is this – Detective Aidan Black (David Sutcliffe) is a messed-up Toronto police veteran who is still suffering some trauma from an occurrence that required him to shoot two people. As far as the bosses are concerned, he did no wrong, but he is reassigned to what's called the psychological crimes unit, which deals with people or crimes that involve mental illnesses. These good cops are, as CBC says, obliged to “struggle to achieve balance between protecting the public from harm and protecting the dignity of all citizens – often at the expense of their own mental health.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Cracked is, we're told, based on the experiences of real cops dealing with the mentally ill on Toronto's streets, several episodes in, it still feels oddly fabricated. Often it is fatally banal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the problem is the trite set-up for the larded police procedurals that unfold weekly on the series. The unit includes psychiatrist Dr. Daniella Ridley (Stefanie von Pfetten), who was a big-time shrink at a hospital but is nobly motivated to help the cops, the set-up tells us. There is also the skeptical, hard-nosed rookie Poppy (Luisa D'Oliveira), whose toughness is counterbalanced by a really nice, humane psychiatric nurse (Dayo Ade). Each case requires the characters to be revealed to be exactly the way they've been described, to the point where it seems like cardboard cut-outs are being moved around the scenes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mind you, Sutcliffe, who is in almost every scene, is excellent. He's low-key and solid, even when the script calls for broad strokes and implausible plot twists. Around him, however, a lack of subtlety abounds. And while the show does have the merit of using a lot of good Canadian music on its soundtrack, there are scenes that scream obviousness – because the music is being used to underscore an already pronounced point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cracked is created by Tracey Forbes, who has written for many Canadian series, including Falcon Beach, Instant Star, The Bridge and Flashpoint, plus some episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Her co-creator is listed as Toronto Emergency Task Force officer Calum de Hartog. I'm sure it seemed like a good idea to put a TV-cop-show spin on authentic issues of mental health on Toronto's streets but, like so much of what CBC attempts in drama, it's neither one thing nor another. It's not thrilling entertainment, nor is it scathing enough about the isolation of those with mental-health issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tonight's episode, which is a repeat of one that aired a few weeks ago, is a guaranteed groan-inducer. The CBC synopsis is this: “Aidan develops a dangerous relationship with a woman he rescues from a psychotic killer still on the loose.” Right. Well, the woman is played by Canadian Kathleen Robertson, who was so fabulously good on Boss. Here, she is utterly misused in a script that telegraphs its key twist in the opening minutes. All the viewer has to see is her character's weird embrace of Det. Black when she's rescued, and you can see everything that's coming. It's all too blatant and banal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also airing tonight</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk To Me: The Story of James Patrick Peek (CTV Two, 8 p.m.; TSN 2, 9:30 p.m.) deals directly with the issue of mental illness. Made by TSN producer Mike Farrell, it's about his friends, the Peek family, and in particular James Peek, who committed suicide in 1999. He was just 17 years old and, as he's described, “the prototypical Canadian teenager.” A great hockey player, good student and well-liked, he suffered from depression but the warning signs of suicidal intent were missed. The program focuses on his family and their efforts to understand and to do something to help local mental-health programs. It is, at times, very tough to watch, but it's a story worth knowing that resists the simplicity of easy explanations or sentimentality.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some days, you can't help feeling that Rob Ford has a point about streetcars.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a snowstorm like the one that hit the city on Friday, the same problem always crops up. Because of the snow piled up at the side of the street, motorists park too far from the curb, making it impossible for streetcars to get past. So the streetcar halts in the middle of the road. Cars and other streetcars line up behind. Pretty soon, you have a right mess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the <span class="companylink">Toronto Transit Commission</span>, it happened 22 times on Friday, causing delays averaging 20 minutes; 42 times on Saturday, causing delays averaging 22 minutes; and 38 times on Sunday, causing delays averaging 34 minutes. Thousands of transit riders had to sit and wait on their streetcar or get off in the cold and find another way to their destination. As they say, it's no way to run a railroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main blame has to lie with the drivers. There should be a special chamber of Hell reserved for the motorists who leave their vehicles in the way of streetcars. It does not take an advanced degree to tell when your car is hanging out in the street. If it is even close to the tracks, the obvious thing to do is find somewhere else to park. Even an overhanging side mirror can hold up a procession of streetcars. But, given that there will always be careless and callous people, the city ought to have better ways to deal with the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The way it works now, a streetcar driver who finds a car “afoul of rail” (as TTC jargon puts it) must call transit control, which then dispatches a supervisor and a parking-enforcement officer to ticket the car and have it towed. When a big snowstorm hits, transit supervisors take along a couple of extra parking officers to help them deal with this perennial problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transit activist Steve Munro says a better way would be to give the TTC power to ticket and order tows on its own authority. The TTC used to have special constables riding transit, but the police services board took away their status in 2010. If they got that status back, as the TTC wants, they could help enforce the law against blocking streetcars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Munro says that the city should also take advantage of its power to declare a snow emergency, banning any parking on major routes, including those with streetcar lines, for 72 hours. That would avoid “afoul of rail” incidents and, as a bonus, make it possible for plows to clear the roads without working around parked cars. As it is, those “No parking, snow route” signs are meaningless. Other cities, such as Montreal and Ottawa, are a lot tougher about getting cars off the streets while they clean up after a snowstorm. Of course, the ultimate solution would be to get rid of streetcars altogether. A bus could at least pull around a car jutting into the street. That would make the mayor happy, no doubt. People “don't want these damn streetcars clogging up our city,” he famously exclaimed during a city council debate last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the city's 11 streetcar routes are a vital part of its transit network. A streetcar carries about 50 per cent more passengers than a typical bus, and the new, bigger streetcars coming next year will carry even more. Replacing the streetcar fleet with buses would fill downtown streets with roaring diesel vehicles. Getting past them as they pulled in and out of stops on these relatively narrow roadways would be no treat either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of banning streetcars, the city should focus on making them run more smoothly and reliably. One way is to limit left-hand turns and street parking. Another would be to make the busiest routes, like King Street, car-free during rush hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, though, the least Toronto can do is to get better at keeping cars out of their way after a big snowfall.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘Benedict XVI Leaves the Papacy,” reads the stunning headline of the Vatican's L'Osservatore Romano. Monday's announcement of Pope Benedict's resignation caught many in the Roman Catholic Church and the world by surprise. But perhaps it shouldn't have. Pope Benedict XVI submitted his resignation freely, in accordance with Canon 332 of the church's Code of Canon Law. It is an unprecedented decision in modern history and offers the church and the world a profound teaching moment. It is perfectly in line with one of the greatest teachers of the faith that the church has ever known.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I remember the day of his election to the papacy on April 19, 2005. “After the great Pope John Paul II, the cardinals have elected me, a simple and humble labourer in the vineyard of the Lord.” With these words an ecstatic but nervous-looking Benedict XVI prefaced his first Urbi et Orbi (to the city and to the world) blessing. People were surprised to hear the new Pope describe himself as “simple and humble.” Yet that is exactly who he is and who he has been for the church, especially over the past eight years of his Petrine Ministry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was pigeonholed from the beginning as the “conservative” pope. On that election day, I said publicly that he was perhaps the most misunderstood leader we have had in the church. His resignation is one of the boldest, most liberal decisions that any pope has ever taken. He has set a new course for the church.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past eight years on the chair of Peter, Pope Benedict turned to Scripture far more than doctrine, making connections between the early Christians and people of our time struggling to live their faith. He tackled contemporary social and political issues by emphasizing a few main principles: that human rights rest on human dignity, that people come before profits, that the right to life is an ancient measure of humanity and not just a Catholic teaching, and that efforts to exclude God from civil affairs are corroding modern society. “A world emptied of God, a world that has forgotten God, loses life and falls into a culture of death.” Ultimately, for Benedict, Christianity is an encounter with beauty; the possibility of a more authentic, more exciting life. His mantra was about friendship with Jesus and with God.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have known Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger and now Pope Benedict XVI for many years. I have been with him in Rome, Germany, Australia and the United States. His extraordinary intelligence, kindness, gentleness, clarity of thought and expression moved me as a young seminarian and over the past 26 years of ordained priestly ministry. His masterful homilies, talks and reflections were and remain a source of great spiritual nourishment for me and for millions of people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he took possession of the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran nearly eight years ago, he said: “The one who holds the office of the Petrine Ministry must be aware that he is a frail and weak human being – just as his own powers are frail and weak – and is constantly in need of purification and conversion.” Monday, he showed us that he took those words to heart and put them into practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Old Testament, we find the moving story of Joseph, who, after generations of family turmoil, disunity and even hate, united his family in forgiveness and love. In emotional scenes that could easily be part of a great opera, Joseph questions his brothers, who do not recognize him, about their beloved father, still grieving over the supposed death of his missing son. When he confronts them and sees that they have undergone a change of heart, he embraces them and utters the immortal words, “I am Joseph, your brother” (Genesis 45:4).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pope Benedict has shown us in a remarkable way that he is indeed Joseph, our brother. The occasion of his resignation stands as an important moment in the life of the Catholic Church and in the life of the world. It is a time to take stock, a time to give thanks for this brilliant pastor and a time to learn eternal lessons from a great teacher.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He earned the nickname Captain Serious from his <span class="companylink">Chicago Blackhawks</span> teammates soon after arriving in the NHL because there was a gravitas to the early Jonathan Toews that belied his tender years.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even at 19, when he broke into the NHL as a rookie alongside Patrick Kane, Toews was all business. The <span class="companylink">Blackhawks</span> were a mess back then, an Original Six franchise that had fallen on hard, hard times, which is how they came to draft Toews third overall in 2006 and Patrick Kane first overall the next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Together, the two helped jump-start a turnaround in Chicago's fortunes that you still see today. The <span class="companylink">Blackhawks</span> are perched atop the NHL standings, the only team still undefeated in regulation after 12 games (10-0-2), and looking like a Stanley Cup contender again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their turnaround has been fuelled by multiple factors – improved goaltending from Corey Crawford, Kane's 19 points – but mostly because Toews is off to an unusually productive start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Traditionally in the past, Johnny just gets better as the season goes along,” says Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville, a polite way of saying Toews is never very fast out of the gate. “Every year he gets better as an individual and a player, but this year, I think he's starting off at a different level right from the outset.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What sets Toews's accomplishments apart is how much he's won at a comparatively young age. Now 24, the Winnipeg native – who is fluently bilingual and thus a darling with all the French-speaking reporters that pass through Chicago – had a year for the ages in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, after being the youngest forward named to Canada's 2010 men's Olympic team, he led the tournament with eight points and scored the opening goal in the gold-medal game – a 3-2 win over the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, he then led the <span class="companylink">Blackhawks</span> to the Stanley Cup and won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoffs' most valuable player, finishing second in postseason scoring only because Daniel Brière produced three points in a losing effort for <span class="companylink">Philadelphia Flyers</span> that night.It made Toews the 24th (and youngest member ever) of the <span class="companylink">International Ice Hockey Federation</span>'s Triple Gold Club – which honours players who've won a Stanley Cup, an Olympic gold medal and a senior men's world championship in their careers. Toews has also won two world junior championships with Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the night the <span class="companylink">Blackhawks</span> won the Stanley Cup, teammate John Madden described Toews as “mature beyond his years” and wondered what was left for him to do, considering everything he'd accomplished by his 22nd birthday. Turns out, motivation is never an issue with Toews.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I guess the age I was at, I wouldn't say I was naïve, but just the fact that it was so early in my career and I was getting these huge opportunities – I just had a positive outlook and thought that if I kept working, good things were going to happen,” explained Toews in an interview. “To have a season like I had in 2010 – to win the Olympics and our team going all the way to the Stanley Cup – now everyone looks back and expects you to do that again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So there's a lot more pressure now. You're in a very different situation. Your game matures. You kind of understand how rare those opportunities are and how hard you have to work to get back there. So we're trying to do that with our team in Chicago and possibly going to Russia next year.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is easy to forget that Toews's presence on the 2010 men's Olympic roster was not considered a sure bet. Four years earlier, the management team for the 2006 Olympics in Turin left a similarly precocious talent – one Sidney Crosby – off the team, on the grounds that it wanted a more experienced squad to handle the extraordinary pressures that Canada faces in those events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thankfully, the new executive director Steve Yzerman followed his instincts and selected both Toews, then 21, and defenceman Drew Doughty, then 20. Both turned out to be important catalysts. Toews was named Canada's best forward and received tournament all-star honours from the IIHF directorate; Doughty was on the No. 1 defensive unit by the end of the tournament.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barring injury, Toews's presence on the 2014 team is considered a mortal lock, provided the NHL decides to send its players to Russia. But he is careful, when asked to look a year down the road, not to take anything for granted. He talks about Sochi as a team that he still needs to make.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Just being in the Olympics was a dream come true,” said Toews, “and being in Canada, playing for Team Canada, that just added to it. It was a once-in-a-lifetime thing. Even though Canada will be defending the gold medal [in Sochi], they'll play a little more the role of spoiler, not being on their home turf. That could help, but I don't it ever takes away from the pressure that's on that team to win.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So six years after arriving in the NHL, is the captain any less serious?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“To be honest with you, I think he has lightened up a little bit, especially from the first couple of years,” Kane said. “That's when he got the name – because he was so serious. As time went on, I think his true personality came out. He's still serious obviously when he needs to be, and takes on the role of being the captain very well, but at the same time, away from the rink or at the hotel, he's just a regular guy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toews, for his part, says with a laugh: “For a long time, I've been trying to fight off that nickname, especially with the guys who like to give me a hard time. They know it gets on my nerves a little bit. But sometimes, it definitely comes out – because that's my personality. I like to work hard and to win.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As a player and as a guy and the captain in the room, that's probably one of the things where I've developed the most – just enjoying the game and not taking it too seriously, I guess.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps more than anything, Toews's profile grew in Canada in recent years through a series of commercial advertisements for Canadian Tire. You couldn't turn on the television around Christmas, without seeing him promoting the chain's hockey products. They know him in Vancouver too, where the Canucks and the <span class="companylink">Blackhawks</span> have forged one of hockey's most compelling rivalries, thanks to three playoff meetings in the past four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toews will tell you his visibility in Chicago has grown every single year, but “you come up to Canada and people are crazy about hockey, they know who you are. It's definitely reached another level.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, for that matter, have Toews and the <span class="companylink">Blackhawks</span> in the early going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“His line [with Marian Hossa and rookie Brandon Saad] has been pretty amazing,” Quenneville said. “Night in, night out, at the end of the night, you're probably sitting there, saying, ‘They've had about five grade A-plus scoring chances.' Maybe the puck didn't necessarily go in, but they dominated some shifts. We like the way he's playing in all areas. He's got some pace to his game. He really seems to be excited about this season and the guys.”</p>

No outsized gains, no big declines. Everything was more or less as it was in the calmer days of yesteryear, except for the mutual fund industry's unchallenged influence with investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Done right, mutual funds are a great way for people to invest. Funds are available anywhere financial products are sold, they can accommodate people with small amounts of money to invest, they're ideal for making regular monthly contributions and, ideally, they provide access to smart money managers at reasonable cost. But the fund industry has so lost its way lately that I feel the need to stick up for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot of people make their investing decisions for the year during registered retirement savings plan season, which ends with the RRSP deadline of March 1. Whether you invest yourself or through an adviser, don't dismiss mutual funds. Their archrival, exchange-traded funds, may or may not suit the kind of investor you are, and picking individual stocks and bonds is hard. Mutual funds are easy compared to the alternatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The point of a lot of financial literacy initiatives is that we must smarten people up so they can march ahead to better solutions. For example, investors who understand how stupid-expensive some mutual funds are might choose to open an online brokerage account and start using low-cost exchange-traded funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mutual funds are how we cover off the people who need easy, accessible investing solutions that meet them where they are right now. For example, there are the people who will never open an online brokerage account, no matter how many good things they hear about ETFs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was about $850-billion invested in mutual funds at the end of 2012, which means the fund industry utterly dominates retail investing. But funds don't seem to have much momentum these days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Report on Business colleagues and I wrote recently about how retail investors are coming back in force to the stock market (read online at tgam.ca/Dmpc). But in December, a good month for stocks, people sold $1.2-billion more in equity mutual funds than they purchased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the heyday of the mutual fund industry, equity fund managers were like hockey stars. Now, it seems as if the equity fund is falling out of favour as a way for investors to get their exposure to the stock market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund industry is still doing okay thanks to brisk sales of bond funds, balanced funds and wrap products, where multiple funds of all types are packaged into a single diversified investment product. Last year, industry assets under management rose 10.4-per-cent over the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that's lame in comparison to what ETFs did in 2012. National Bank Financial's analysts say it was a record year for ETFs in which assets jumped 28 per cent to $56.4-billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, dramatic sales increases are easier to generate off of a small asset base. But give ETFs credit for consistency – they've been outgrowing funds for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mutual fund industry certainly isn't helping itself connect with investors. Most importantly, it acts like it's oblivious to criticism of its high fees. A major portion of the fees charged by most funds is accounted for by commissions paid to advisers and their firms. Separating this commission from fund fees would help add transparency to what advisers do, and it would make funds cheaper and more directly comparable to ETFs (which don't usually bury adviser compensation in the fee).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund industry seems mute on all these topics, so let me speak for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mutual funds, chosen with care, are just the thing for your RRSP. Funds give you every possible investing category in an easily accessible package that comes with varying levels of advice. Also, the fund industry is no monolith. There are high- and low-cost firms, each with a different way of serving investors and advisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not all talk on this. In the retirement accounts I look after, there are mutual funds alongside ETFs, individual stocks, bonds and guaranteed investment certificates. I've come to meet some smart people in my job who run mutual funds, and I'm trusting some of my retirement money to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mutual fund industry in Canada is its own worst enemy. But mutual funds themselves are still relevant.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conservative government's proposed new law aimed at making sure severely mentally ill offenders are not set free while they're still dangerous is a fair and measured response to the problem of Vince Li, Allan Schoenborn and Guy Turcotte.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not about myth, stereotype or stigma. It's about community protection in the face of individual dangers. It's about Mr. Li, Mr. Schoenborn and Dr. Turcotte.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Li of Manitoba decapitated and ate body parts of a man sitting next to him on a bus. Mr. Schoenborn stabbed his three children to death in Merritt, B.C. Dr. Turcotte stabbed his two young children to death in Prévost, Que.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mental health and justice systems made catastrophic mistakes in at least some of these cases; the violently ill Mr. Schoenborn, for instance, had been released after a travesty of a bail hearing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new law would remove excuses for any subsequent failures by setting this group apart. A Crown attorney would be able to ask a judge for a “high-risk designation” in violent crimes where there is a “substantial likelihood” of more violence or where the “brutal nature” of the crime suggests a grave risk of physical or psychological harm to another person in the future. The cases of Mr. Li, Mr. Schoenborn and Dr. Turcotte fit this designation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those designated would still be able to qualify for court-ordered release, if a review board says the high-risk designation no longer applies. But some individuals would have to wait up to three years for that review hearing; currently, the hearings are held annually. It would be better for all concerned to assess these individuals over three years instead of one. Dr. Turcotte was released within a year and a half of his trial, on condition that he undergo psychotherapy. “It's essential that his team be on hand in case his state deteriorates,” said the head of the panel that released him. The statement does not inspire confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not a punitive law, nor does it arbitrarily lump together all those found not criminally responsible for their actions by reason of a mental disorder – what used to be known as insanity. It would explicitly make public safety the most important consideration in any release. It is hard to believe that it was not already explicit.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the announcement of his resignation on Monday, Pope Benedict XVI has shown both his modesty – his awareness of his limits – and the degree to which he has very much a mind of his own. Retirement rumours had not been circulating; his own spokesperson was taken by surprise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, at the beginning of his papacy, Benedict was slow to realize that he needed a great deal of help from communications staffers, as if his undoubted articulateness and lucidity were enough for the leader of such a large and complex organization.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If one may borrow a phrase from accountancy, Benedict has been a good CEO “on a going-forward basis.” He established reasonably solid reforms to prevent any recurrences of priests' sexual abuse of children or of financial improprieties, but he has been less effective in holding individuals accountable for past wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Cardinal Ratzinger, he was mainly known to the world as a doctrinal enforcer. As soon as he became Pope, however, he emerged as a prolific author, starting with his encyclical on love, Deus Caritas Est (God is love) in 2005, which was well received even by his long-time colleague and antagonist Hans Kung.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has continued to publish books of real freshness, writing with a clarity that has not always been characteristic of German intellectuals. By comparison, his predecessor's style was dense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, Benedict has successfully fulfilled the teaching function of his office, however mixed his record as an administrator may be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His stylistic sense also appeared in his ear for liturgy. Without reverting to the remote ritual of the 16th century, his reforms in this area deftly retouched the sometimes flat, leaden wording of the new mass of the 1970s, restoring a certain mystery and sublimity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the manner of his leaving office, Pope Benedict XVI revealed himself as an innovator. He has turned out to be someone very conscious that, in an age of longevity, death is no longer the best time to retire from a major job. This highly self-aware, humble but independent decision offers much hope that the departing Pope will continue to contribute much to the world as a writer, philosopher and theologian.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a match-up you could not miss. The hottest goaltender of January, Craig Anderson of the <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span>, and Ryan Miller of the <span class="companylink">Buffalo Sabres</span>, the hottest goaltender of last week, squaring off in a battle of American netminders.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact Anderson's NHL team won easily, 2-0, is no reflection on the Buffalo side, as Miller was almost as solid as the ever-impressive Anderson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a full year to go before the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and the Canadian nail is already bitten to the quick as to which goaltender will wear the Maple Leaf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's just the way it is in Canada. After naming the team comes Senate reform, the Alberta economy and who will succeed the abdicating Pope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the United States, where hockey rarely, if ever, enters the national conversation despite taking silver in the last Olympics and winning gold at the most recent world junior championship, there seems no question: It will be Miller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(But not here in the frozen north: Is Martin Brodeur, fast going on 41, too old? Will Carey Price be hot or cold? Can Cam Ward come all the way back? Is Corey Crawford for real?)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anderson, 31, from Park Ridge, Ill., is never mentioned when the potential goaltenders for Team USA comes up, yet his play is more responsible than any others for Ottawa's fast start this year. An impressive start that unfortunately cooled off after centre Jason Spezza was lost to back surgery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miller, 32, from East Lansing, Mich., is playing net for a struggling team that has but two boasts: leading NHL scorer Thomas Vanek and Miller. The two, however, cannot do it alone, as the struggling Sabres seem destined for life at the lower rungs of the standings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two teams having trouble at the other net; two teams with no trouble in their own net.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than half the game Tuesday neither side could penetrate the other's crease. Miller was outstanding as he made saves off James Norris Memorial Trophy winning defenceman Erik Karlsson and kept out several goalmouth scrambles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anderson more than matched him, robbing Vanek at one point and making a lightning quick save off lanky rookie forward Mikhail Grigorenko. In all, Anderson stopped all 42 shots, Miller 29 of 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senators finally broke through Miller's wall when Karlsson – who else? – scored a short-handed goal on a hard blast that the partially screened Sabres goalie could not pick up in time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a horrible outing for Buffalo special teams. They had seven power-play opportunities and could not score on them. They did, however, get scored against on one – the ultimate insult for a power play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senators went ahead 2-0 on a hopeless, Keystone Kops scramble in which Miller made saves but was left helpless on the ice when Erik Condra finally chipped a looping puck up and into the back of the Buffalo net.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Ryan's been great,” Buffalo head coach Lindy Ruff said. “He's been big in every game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Sometimes, you wish you had a little more support from the offensive side.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa coach Paul MacLean could utter the same complaint. After a surprisingly good start to the season, the Senators had lost four of their last five games – the one win coming against Buffalo a week earlier, when Ruff had elected to give Miller a break and start backup Jhonas Enroth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a welcome victory for MacLean, who has been mixing lines like martinis in an effort to compensate for Spezza's scoring and play making. His players, he said, had become “tight and tentative” as they tried too hard to get back to winning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday, it worked. But it will take more than Anderson if the Senators are to again reach the playoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Canadians, however, are these days thinking more of next year's Olympics than summer's Stanley Cup playoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The talk shows speculate endlessly on who will be in net, and publications regularly run lists of who is definite to be on the team, and who might be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet, it is largely a myth that goaltenders are the key to Olympic victory. There has been but one instance since the NHL began participating in the Games that a goaltender has been the great difference.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As recently as a decade ago, cocktail aficionados keen on mixing a historically accurate Martinez or Brandy Crusta would have been out of luck. Codified in Jerry Thomas's seminal 1862 book, How to Mix Drinks, the venerable potations contained dashes of Boker's Bitters, an alcohol-based infusion of herbs, spices and barks.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brand, created in 1828, had faded from history, felled by the axe of Prohibition. But almost a century after its demise, Boker's is back, exhumed by a Scottish company that recreated the tonic using an old recipe. Produced by Aberdeen-based Dr. Adam Elmegirab's Bitters, it's a shining example of the recent boom in over-the-counter bitters, flavourings once considered essential to a well-stocked bar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At BYOB Cocktail Emporium, an accessories store in Toronto, one can find more than 75 flavours on offer, including leathery Boker's, spicy Bittermens Hellfire Habanero Shrub, Fee Brothers West Indian Orange, The Bitter Truth Original Celery and Bittered Sling Grapefruit &amp; Hops. The tiny bottles, some available for sampling, sit on a wooden shelving unit like a tableau from a 19th-century apothecary, an homage to the products' provenance as remedies for everything from colds to flatulence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“New brands keep coming up every day,” Kristen Voisey, the shop's owner, told me last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not long ago, the category in Canada was synonymous with one brand, Angostura, typically found near the vanilla extract in the supermarket baking aisle. With its iconic oversized label and yellow cap, it is the king of bittersville, the defining bass note of a proper Manhattan, Champagne Cocktail and many other classics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Born in Venezuela in the 1820s and later transplanted to Trinidad, Angostura escaped the fate of hundreds of others that either ran afoul of health-claims laws or dried up in the boozepocalypse of the 1920s. The other famous survivor is Peychaud's, an anise-scented gem considered de rigueur for New Orleans's signature Sazerac, based on rye, simple syrup and absinthe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though commonly defined as “non-potable” flavouring agents, cocktail bitters usually contain 40 to 55 per cent alcohol. That solvent is handy for drawing out and preserving aromatic essences of roots, barks, spices, herbs, flowers and fruit peels. Thirsty Prohibition-era Americans would sometimes feign ill health and chug the bracing tonics straight. An inevitable crackdown ensued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of the repeal of Prohibition, bitters languished as mixology descended into the vodka-highball and blender-drink Dark Ages. Then came today's exacting young barkeeps, who began crafting house-made extracts to recapture the Golden Age. Frankly, I can't be bothered to make my own. It's a hit-or-miss proposition that involves steeping ingredients such as gentian and cassia bark for weeks in more Mason jars than my Italian mother used for tomato sauce. Thankfully, I no longer need to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inspired by the bar scene, crafty entrepreneurs have answered our prayers with ready-made potions. The offerings aren't cheap, ranging from $10 to $30 for a 120-millilitre bottle. But there are about 130 dashes inside, and one shake can bring vital verve and aromatic complexity to a drink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If a cocktail doesn't balance, if you can't figure it out, you put a dash of one of these in and it solves the problem,” says Lauren Mote, co-owner of Kale &amp; Nori Culinary Arts, a Vancouver catering company that makes the excellent Bittered Sling line. She is specifically referring to Moondog, a smoky-peppery delight, and Denman, an Asian-spice extract named after a Vancouver street famous for its multicultural restaurant scene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with Boker's, Peychaud's, Bittermens and many other products, Bittered Sling can be found at select gourmet food and private liquor stores around the country, through BYOB (www.byobto.com[http://www.byobto.com]) and The Crafty Bartender (www.thecraftybartender.com[http://www.thecraftybartender.com]) as well as from a variety of online retailers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craft distillers have also entered the fray, including Victoria Spirits in British Columbia, with a line called Twisted &amp; Bitter, and 66 Gilead Distillery of Prince Edward County in Ontario, with products that include a ginger flavour as well as cranberry-sumac. Among my favourites is Bittermens Xocolatl Mole, infused with cacao, cinnamon and other spices and produced in Brooklyn, N.Y. Two dashes can turn a shot of aged tequila into a no-fuss multilayered cocktail, filling out the body while giving a chocolate hug to the spirit's spicy-vegetal essence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, you can get by with that bottle of Angostura, but it would be a sad victory for Prohibition if you did. “It's not a fad for me,” says Brad Thomas Parsons, the Brooklyn-based author of the lively and fascinating 2011 book Bitters: A Spirited History of a Classic Cure-All. “Bitters happen to be trendy right now, but they're part of a great drink.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A compendium of lore, cocktail recipes and new-brand profiles, Parsons's book rightly dismisses the popular misconception that bitters always impart bitterness to a drink. The term is just a technical descriptor for liquid cocktail seasonings, some of which come across as sweetly floral and fruity and not at all acrid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says a proper bar should be anchored with Angostura, Peychaud's and at least one orange bitters. “From there, it's what you drink and what would you use them for,” he says. Citrus or celery flavours work nicely with gin, for example. while a brown-spirits lover might prefer something more robust and aromatic, such as Fee Brothers Whiskey Barrel-Aged Bitters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like me, Parsons is fond of shaking four to six dashes into a glass of club soda when something stiffer isn't suitable. “That's one of my go-to drinks if I'm at a work party and don't want to drink,” he says. “It's an appetite stimulant and a digestif too. I feel like a million bucks.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Friday's non-bubbly housing start numbers and weak employment data should not distract Canadians from two key points. First, after a short, sharp economic shock, Canada's economy began its recovery in late spring 2009 and has hardly paused since. Second, in comparison with the U.S., the EU, and especially the U.K, Canada's performance has been stellar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's performance certainly bought attention in the U.K., where some of the credit has rightly landed in the lap of Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Mr. Carney landed in London for a public pre-entry interview by the House of Commons treasury committee, which wanted to know how he would manage monetary policy at the Bank of England, where he takes over in July. The committee had not previously held such a hearing for an incoming governor. Nor, to my knowledge, has a Canadian central bank governor previously given such detail on his thinking on monetary policy and managing another country's money and financial market regulation – 45 densely written and footnoted pages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carney made clear that the institutional and regulatory factors that may have contributed to Canada's relative success may not transport well to the U.K. But he did not use the word “luck,” which many economists would describe as a key feature in Canada having missed the brunt of the globally protracted economic storm. (The technical economic term is “horseshoes.”)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that is what makes interesting his views on Canada's domestic monetary policy framework, which arguably played an important role in our recent economic success and therefore are a likely guide to the central bank's future thinking on the issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carney briefly nodded to Canada's 2-per-cent inflation target, set within a floating exchange rate system – much like the U.K.'s. His real focus, however, was on flexibility, meaning the pace at which the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> would get around to hitting its target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, bank speeches began to point out that while Canada tended to hit its inflation target on average, the number of months it took for the inflation rate to move was sometimes few and sometimes many. Previously, this was taken to be an ordinary bug in the conduct of monetary policy; that monetary policy had its apparent effects only with “long and variable lags,” and, as former governor John Crow used to say, one could see policy's future impact only “through a glass, darkly.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the November, 2011, renewal of the 2-per-cent inflation target between Ottawa and the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span>, this flexibility became official bank policy. No subsequent formal bank addresses have failed to use the prefix “flexible” when describing Canada's inflation targeting program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If one can be flexible about the time it takes to hit inflation targets, one has intervening time to pay attention to other things. In the U.K., Mr. Carney mentioned as possibilities countering the effects of rising oil prices (a sore point there, with North Sea oil revenues on the decline), or promoting adjustment to credit crunches or financial excesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If languorous attention to the inflation target is permitted, the list of potential distractions can get long. Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, speaking to the C.D. Howe Institute last fall, argued that getting U.S. unemployment down to 6.5 per cent was the right target, and this is now Fed policy. Ignoring inflation and instead setting a dollar target for national income is an idea that has raged in the economics blogosphere for 18 months, and which has now appeared several times in Mr. Carney's public words.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many new ideas will sound good in the U.K., given the country's economic performance (for which sluggish would be too kind a word) and and an inflation rate that has sat well above its target for most of the past five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada, however, we seem to have been more than decently served by the 2-per-cent inflation target, even if, in retrospect, it sometimes took us a few months to get back to it. A flexible exchange rate, tolerable federal fiscal performance, decent financial sector regulation – all have added to Canada's relatively shiny economic performance. These, and more than a few horseshoes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin Dumont, the disgraced star witness of the Charbonneau inquiry, sparked Gérard Tremblay's resignation when he asserted with composure that the Montreal mayor had turned a blind eye to the illegal cash donations that were bursting out of the party's safe. By a sad twist of irony, it was a lie – or an assertion so contorted by contradiction it is now shrouded in doubt.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don't need to know this,” is what Mayor Tremblay said, according to Mr. Dumont. That was the breaking point for Montrealers, who felt that Mr. Tremblay's resignation was overdue after a series of scandals had stained his administration beyond what any heavy-duty detergent could ever clean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what made Mr. Dumont's assertion all the more believable is that we are very good at looking the other way when it serves our purposes. How Canadian companies land contracts in remote countries gangrened with corruption, we didn't want to know. That is, until the companies really got too cozy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government has just tabled a stiffer law to prosecute companies that distribute bribes to win contracts abroad, after a series of high-profile cases has drawn attention to the unpalatable costs of doing business in Third World countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary-based Griffiths International recently disclosed it paid a $2-million bribe to secure oil and gas exploration contracts in Chad, which led to a more than $10-million fine. The Mounties believe that <span class="companylink">SNC-Lavalin Group Inc</span>. showered the third son of Libya's late dictator with $160-million worth of gifts, according to a search warrant just unsealed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians like to think of themselves as a law-abiding people, but the fact is that the country has stood out in the Western world as a convenient place for bribers to do business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Canada ratified the OECD convention to combat the bribery of foreign public officials and enacted a law that criminalized such payouts in the late 1990s, no real action ensued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only in 2011 did Canada get serious when it fined <span class="companylink">Niko Resources</span>, a Calgary exploration company, with a $9.5-million penalty. The case was sickening: Niko bribed the junior Bangladeshi Energy Minister responsible for setting the compensation the company was to pay to a village where one of its wells exploded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is now stepping up its act with maximum sentences for bribing foreign officials that are as severe as the 14-year ones for bribes paid to local politicians. It is joining countries like the United States that are actively pursuing foreign corruption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cases involving multinationals now surface with the evenness of a metronome. Tuesday, the Italian police arrested the CEO of defence group <span class="companylink">Finmeccanica SpA</span> over allegations Giuseppe Orsi paid bribes to secure the sale of 12 helicopters in India. <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart Stores Inc</span>. is under investigation for the “gestores” that its Mexican affiliate allegedly paid out to local officials. And the U.S. investigation that was launched into <span class="companylink">Avon Products Inc</span>.'s questionable payments in China was extended to other countries in Latin America and Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the worm is in the apple, as the French saying goes, is it such a stretch to think that the dubious practices that some Canadian companies have used overseas have made their way back home? Or maybe it is the other way around?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Had you suggested this even recently, business lobby groups would have sued you faster than Lucky Luke can draw its gun on the Dalton brothers. But with the Charbonneau inquiry, they now stare in embarrassment at their feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of all the eye-popping stories heard since this inquiry began, Michel Lalonde's recent testimony was the most devastating. The president of Genius Conseil is one of the little guys of the engineering business. But in detailing how firms allegedly colluded and funnelled illegal cash contributions to Gérald Tremblay's party, he implicated just about every engineering company of importance in Quebec: Cima+, Dessau, Groupe SM, Genivar, Roche, <span class="companylink">SNC-Lavalin</span>, Tecsult (now Aecom) and the list goes on. Big firms gave $200,000, small ones gave $100,000, Mr. Lalonde contends. And everybody got their plumped-up contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, Mr. Lalonde is no flaky Martin Dumont. Genivar uncovered “inappropriate conduct” soon after Mr. Lalonde's testimony and put an executive on leave of absence until it completes its internal investigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While none of this has been proven in court, Genivar's latest revelations support the idea that collusion was systemic among the engineering firms that once made Quebec proud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a truth so ugly it is painful to look at.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take a $200-million development proposal, add Swiss expertise to Canadian know-how, then let the planning begin in earnest to preserve and expand the Old Stock Exchange Building.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a buzz in the air about a star architect from Switzerland who has been hired to leave his mark on the northwest corner of Howe and Pender in downtown Vancouver. Harry Gugger, meet the old exchange at 475 Howe St. Vancouver, meet Mr. Gugger, who will lend his expertise in the design of a new 30-storey office tower so that it complements the historic 11-storey building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Working in Vancouver is a new and wonderful challenge for me and my team. The design of a regeneration project in a heritage context such as this has always been of special interest to us,” Mr. Gugger said in a statement from Switzerland, where he opened his own architecture firm in 2010, named Harry Gugger Studio. From 1991 to 2009, he was an architectural partner in Herzog &amp; de Meuron, where his work included overseeing the restoration of two art galleries – the Tate Modern in London and the CaixaForum in Madrid. Mr. Gugger was also the partner in charge of the Bird's Nest Stadium in Beijing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premium office space has become a scarce commodity in downtown Vancouver, spurring new projects such as the Telus Garden office and condo development on Robson Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Howe and Pender venture, named The Exchange, will be primarily devoted to office space. The basement and ground level will be set aside for retail. In preliminary design changes, the new office tower appears less flashy than in the original renderings. It remains to be seen how the concerns raised by Jameson House condo dwellers across the alley about shadows and blocked views will be addressed in final drawings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heritage consultant Donald Luxton, retained by the developer, said Mr. Gugger is a “starchitect” who will pay homage to the iconic old exchange. The building opened during a golden age for Vancouver in the Roaring Twenties, just months before the Wall Street stock-market crash in October, 1929. The Vancouver Stock Exchange operated out of the Howe Street address until 1947, but the connection lingered over the decades, despite the short lived VSE occupancy, Mr. Luxton said. Vancouver architects Fred Townley and Robert Matheson, who designed 475 Howe St., went on to win the contract for Vancouver City Hall, a landmark since 1936.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Exchange's proponents argue their project dovetails nicely with the City of Vancouver's efforts to make the downtown core more vibrant. City planners have placed a priority on constructing office towers in the financial district while spurning new condo proposals in the same area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A real estate fund managed by <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> is the developer and majority owner of The Exchange while Swissreal Investments Ltd. is the development manager and minority owner. The project will be “built on spec,” meaning on a speculative basis without anchor tenants lined up yet, said Peter Arbuckle, a partner with MKT Arkle Development Management Inc., the project adviser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a huge testament to <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>'s confidence in Vancouver,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office vacancy rates in downtown Vancouver were 4.2 per cent in the final quarter of 2012 – a tight squeeze when compared with rates that surpassed 13 per cent in 2003, according to CBRE Ltd., a leading commercial real estate company. CBRE has been given the task of signing up tenants such as mining corporations and law, accounting and consulting firms to help fill The Exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting in late 2013, a two-storey Pender Street structure next door to the old exchange will be demolished to make way for seven floors of underground parking, said Daniel Hawreluk, the project architect with Vancouver-based Iredale Group Architecture, which is collaborating with Mr. Gugger. Construction completion of The Exchange is targeted for early 2017, and the goal is to have an elegant look that also meets the coveted platinum standard of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gugger, who will be in Vancouver late next week, is the latest star architect to hit the West Coast. Britain's Norman Foster designed Jameson House and Denmark's Bjarke Ingels is the architect behind the planned Beach and Howe mixed-use tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Old Stock Exchange Building is a refined and handsomely crafted building,” Mr. Gugger said. “The new tower will not look to compete with this prominent original building but rather to successfully work with it to provide a composition that at once looks to Vancouver's future without obscuring its past.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Organizers of dinner parties, beware! The chances are admittedly extremely slim, but a few people still read the news, so one of your guests might conceivably raise the two dullest subjects in Canada: the Clarity Act and Senate reform.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one with a hint of social grace would dare ruin a party with talk of either subject, but you can never be completely sure. “Constitutionalitis” is a Canadian disease whose principal symptom of extreme boredom has anesthetized more Canadians than any subject since the War of 1812.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senate reform has been one of constitutionalitis's most enduring strains. Vast shelves of books and studies with remedies for the Canadian Senate are found in every library. Episodically, some politician or academic with nothing better to do blows off the dust and proclaims a lasting remedy for the ailments caused by the existing Senate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These episodes generally accompany the latest outrage or stupidity by one or more members of the Red Chamber or the nomination by a sitting prime minister of a clutch of bagmen, defeated candidates, journalistic shills, personal friends, party staffers or representatives of some ethnic group the prime minister wishes to impress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then, responding to overwhelming public disinterest, the episodic urge to do something passes, and the Senate rolls on, unreformed and unrepentant. Expect Stephen Harper's government, reflecting its Reform Party roots, to keep constitutionalitis alive by insisting that it must be reformed, without being clear on why, how or when. Blocked at every political turn, the government has tossed a series of Senate reform questions to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What the government seems to want is an elected Senate, which sounds very democratic and worthy – until the details are examined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An elected Senate would be powerful, because being elected would make senators somebodies. An empowered Senate must inevitably lead to discussion of how many seats per province. Dreamers talk of a U.S.-style Senate, with the same number of seats per province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can anyone explain to Ontario or Quebec, let alone to Alberta, why New Brunswick should have the same number of senators as those provinces? A more sure-fire recipe for time-wasting has never been invented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Supreme Court has already ruled that the composition of the Senate cannot be changed without provincial consent, which in the real world means no agreement, ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not content with the impossible, the Harper government suggests the improbable: that reform can occur if provinces set up elections for senators, as happened in the United States. But how many premiers, eager to speak for their provinces, will want elected senators vying with them for legitimacy as provincial spokesmen? Yes, this is how an elected Senate came to the United States: Oregon elected senators, and the others eventually followed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Watching the dysfunctional U.S. political system, however, should give advocates of an elected Senate pause. Do we really want a powerful second chamber capable of thwarting the will of the House of Commons? If so, then advocates had better spell out, which they seldom do, how to reconcile the two chambers when they disagree, as they often will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Constitutionalitis is like that: airy thoughts of change unconnected with the reality of how changes would actually work. Put another way, change one part of the federal system – the Senate – and the effect will be felt in the other parts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, of course, there is the politically appealing constitutional dead end: abolish the entire institution. This non-solution is given a regular airing by the New Democrats each time a senator, or a group of them, hits the headlines with allegations of improper conduct, as seen recently with Senator Patrick Brazeau being turfed from the Conservative caucus, over charges of assault and sexual assault, and other senators being accused of claiming living expenses to which they were not entitled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Abolition would require provincial consent, which would not be forthcoming. Every federation has an upper chamber, most of them more effective and legitimate than the Canadian Senate because representatives are elected or appointed by constituent parts of the federation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can argue that these other federations have not collapsed with strong upper chambers. Getting one in Canada would be next to impossible.</p>

It just goes to show, doesn't it? Anyway, his missus is kidnapped. There's a theme about the Nazis, also clocks that hold secret maps, a subplot about submarines and, of course, “a tenacious FBI agent.” All that's missing is zombies, which is a pity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cult(Feb. 19, the The CW, CTV Two) is also way convoluted, but features younger, better-looking people. It's a show-within-a-show, or as the intellectuals in Los Angeles like to put it, “meta.” This teenage guy Nate (James Pizzinato) tells his brother, journalist Jeff (Matt Davis), that a TV show is out to get him – a show with a rabid following called Cult, which is about a cult and its crazy-like-a-fox cult leader (Robert Knepper, who was T-Bag on Prison Break). Turns out Nate might have a point. The series dwells lightly on fan obsession and the dangers of taking TV too seriously, which, of course, we never do in this column. Worth a look.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Golden Boy (Feb. 26, CBS, CTV Two) is your (groan now) CBS-type police procedural with a twist. The main character, one Walter William Clark, Jr. (Theo James ) is the youngest police commissioner in the history of New York City. How did he get there? That question is answered through much flashback to incidents in his meteoric career. Is he genuinely talented, corrupt or a ruthless schemer? The pilot is expertly made to merge the past with the present, and the dialogue has bite. Could be good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parade's End (Feb. 26, HBO Canada) is delightful, but a bit demented, a sort of Downton Abbey on acid. An HBO/BBC production derived from the quartet of novels by Ford Madox Ford, it has Benedict Cumberbatch (Holmes on Sherlock) as a chap torn between his straying wife (Rebecca Hall, being delightful) and a young suffragette. At times it's dead serious, as when our hero goes off to the First World War, and at times it's like a P.G. Wodehouse lark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big Brother Canada (Feb. 27, Slice) is what it is – offering you extraordinary access to a buncha goofs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vikings (March 3, History) is an Irish/Canadian co-production from the people who made The Tudors. Here, we are asked to admire the Viking conquest of parts of Europe, back in the day. Pillage and similar antics by stout-hearted fellas. Swords and sex. From the teasers, it looks gloomy but could be Game ofThrones-ish without sunshine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Red Widow (March 3, ABC, CTV Two) has a plodding pilot in which the wife (Radha Mitchell) of a Russian mob guy/drug dealer in California takes over the drug racket after her husband's murder. She is torn between maintaining a normal life for the kids and loyalty to her husband's code and kin. Extreme silliness presented as serious drama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the department-of-returning-shows, note that Game of Thrones is back, on HBO Canada on March 31 – and might garner more viewers than most new or returning network shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mid-season goes on and on. You have been informed and warned.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a malicious hacker broke into the e-mails of George W. Bush's family and friends last week, the news coverage and public reaction focused on a group of self-portraits the former president had painted and shared with friends. Columnists and pundits gleefully dissected the paintings to look for clues into his state of mind, and they discussed his ability as an artist (he was generally praised). Entirely lost in the discussion was that these were stolen images, taken from the e-mail accounts of private citizens. At what point do the media and the public become complicit in criminal acts when they fail to see them for what they are?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hacker was bent on embarrassing the Bushes, in particular, the two former presidents. The e-mail exchanges between the two men and their relatives and friends provided details into their private lives that were mostly mundane but which also included at least one personal security code. There were also intimate details about the illness that hospitalized George H.W. Bush in December. The hacker boasted that he had hacked hundreds of private e-mail accounts and called the episode “another chapter in the game.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is no game. The <span class="companylink">FBI</span> is investigating and hopes to lay criminal charges. Hacking is a terrible crime. It can seem funny when it happens to powerful public figures, but it wouldn't be funny if it happened to you. It could be done by, or on behalf of, an estranged partner or someone else who wishes you ill. There are already revenge websites on the Internet, where jilted lovers post embarrassing photos and messages from their exes in order to hurt them; there is a market for the contents of your private life. And it should be noted that computer experts say the hack into the Bush family and friends' accounts was not a sophisticated one; it was probably a case of the account users having obvious passwords that the hacker was able to guess at. When one of the most common passwords is “password,” we are all vulnerable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until the public begins to see computer hacking for the crime that it is, it will continue to be commonplace. We all need to wake up and think twice about trading in the fenced goods of Internet thieves. We need to shame the hackers, not be their accomplices.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an ideal world, Senate reform – much talked about these days, albeit mostly within the narrow confines of the political class – should follow a clear model.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either the Senate is, as it theoretically was supposed to be, a truly informed chamber of “sober second thought,” where enlightened citizens from various walks of life, appointed on merit, would study legislation without being encumbered by partisan considerations, or the Senate is a representative body of elected “delegates” from the provinces and territories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latter model would be redundant. Why have a chamber representative of the regions when we already have 10 strong provinces and three territories?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the United States also has powerful states, but the <span class="companylink">U.S. Senate</span> was founded in another era. Initially appointed by the state legislatures, senators would “restrain, if possible, the fury of democracy” by curbing the power of the House of Representatives. Since the Senate was not a truly representative body, all states – no matter their size or population – were given two senators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's Senate never lived up to its promise as a chamber of sober second thought, becoming a haven for hacks and fundraisers. Some of Prime Minister Stephen Harper's appointments were a disgrace, the worst that of Jacques Demers, a former hockey coach who, by his own admission, was illiterate. The appointment of Patrick Brazeau, now charged with assault and sexual assault, was another mistake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some well-advised appointments have been made, though, enabling the Senate to fulfill a useful role. Some of its studies, like the recent one on price gaps between the United States and Canada, are an important contribution to public debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harper still dreams of a smaller, reformed Senate that would see members elected for short terms. He will go on dreaming until the Supreme Court tells him it's impossible without amending the Constitution – a Pandora's box that Mr. Harper, sensibly, doesn't want to touch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any case, he wouldn't have the numbers. Quebec would object to having provincially elected senators because they would weaken the power of the Quebec government, and Atlantic provinces have no interest in reforming a body where they are comfortably overrepresented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also can't be abolished without amending the Constitution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One wonders why Mr. Harper is still so fixated on Senate reform. The Triple-E Senate – equal, elected and effective – was the major demand of the Western provinces at the time of the Reform Party, and it made sense then, since the West was grossly underrepresented in the Commons. A Senate where all provinces would have had an equal number of senators endowed with elected legitimacy might have compensated for the unbalanced distribution of Commons seats. But this unfairness has largely been corrected by Conservative legislation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what to do? Maybe the way out would be to pack the Senate with outstanding citizens chosen by a non-partisan committee of, say, university presidents, Order of Canada officers, Supreme Court judges and retired leaders from unions, businesses and aboriginal groups. Just maybe the Senate could gradually be transformed into a real chamber of sober second thought.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As hard as it is to believe, not quite two weeks after Greg Jamison became the latest would-be <span class="companylink">Phoenix Coyotes</span> owner to fail to produce even a whiff of money, a couple of familiar names were in a report Tuesday in the Arizona Republic as teaming up to look at buying the Coyotes from the NHL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anthony LeBlanc, the principal of the Ice Edge group of investors who has been kicking around this deal for more than three years, was said to be joining forces with Chicago businessman Matthew Hulsizer, who took a run at the team a couple of years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alas, even that tenuous scenario is not quite what it appears. A few phone calls, e-mails and text messages showed the situation has not changed from what your humble servant wrote two weeks ago: Hulsizer will only be interested in taking another look at the Coyotes if someone can bring him a finished deal, complete with an arena lease with the suburban City of Glendale that pays enough to make it sensible to own a team that loses more than $20-million (all currency U.S.) a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hulsizer has no interest in spending any time doing the legwork with Glendale's new city council or the NHL, which is still insisting it has to get $170-million for the team it bought out of bankruptcy almost three and a half years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, LeBlanc and Hulsizer have talked. They became friends during this enduring sideshow and they talk regularly. But LeBlanc, who was the only known partner in Jamison's failed bid for the team, was told the same thing Hulsizer tells everyone else: Bring me something that makes sense and I might be interested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So LeBlanc, in turn, put in a call to new Glendale Mayor Jerry Weiers. They plan to meet and LeBlanc will see if there is any reason to head once more into the breach. Confirmation of this came from LeBlanc, who indicated the prospects of success are such that this is not exactly on his front burner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'll go have a chat with the mayor and see if there's a reason to engage,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is any reason to proceed, the work will be done by LeBlanc. It will be up to him to convince the new Glendale council, which has four members who were not part of the bunch that handed over at least $225-million over the years to various Coyotes owners to build their arena and cover some of their losses, to pay out something close to the lease for Jobing.com Arena that Jamison negotiated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sweetheart deal would have seen the city of 250,000 long-suffering souls pay Jamison an average of $15-million per year for 20 years to operate the arena and collect most of the revenue it generated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's what Weiers said of that possibility: “I can guarantee you there is not the same will on council to do the same deal with anyone else.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And LeBlanc, Hulsizer, Jerry Reinsdorf, Jerry Moyes, Steve Ellman or anyone else who's come within a mile of owning the Coyotes will tell you that owning a team that consistently ranks in the bottom two or three NHL teams in attendance makes no sense without a cash-cow lease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, there might be one way a group of investors might, with the emphasis on might, look at buying the team with a lease that pays out more reasonable arena-management fees. If Glendale and the NHL agree to an escape clause after one year, maybe two at the most, should the Coyotes continue to bleed money, then someone might buy in with an eye to moving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, as one insider said, why do that when as it looks now all you have to do is wait four or five months and even the NHL will be ready to relocate?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, and those two groups the mayor keeps dropping hints about who are supposedly interested in buying the Coyotes? One, of course, is LeBlanc. The other one, surprise, surprise, is whispered to be led by someone from parts unknown with deep pockets. Gee, we've never heard that before have we?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Translation: Some rich guy was too polite to immediately hang up when someone from either Glendale or the NHL called.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most of her nearly two years on the job, B.C. Premier Christy Clark has been criticized for failing to present a vision for the province. Now just months before British Columbians go to the polls, she is staking her party's re-election chances on a big, bold idea that bets the farm on B.C.'s resource sector.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, Ms. Clark's Liberal government unveiled plans to create a B.C. Prosperity Fund, modelled very much on the Heritage Savings Fund started by Alberta Premier Peter Lougheed in 1975. But instead of filling its coffers with oil money, Ms. Clark envisions it will one day be filled with billions from the natural gas industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ironically, the announcement comes as Alberta struggles to cope with an uncertain future, thanks in part to the province placing its entire economic trust in the oil sector. The price of Alberta crude has plunged in recent months, leaving an indelible red mark on the province's books. Meantime, B.C. has been put on watch by at least one major credit rating agency concerned about debt levels that have recently climbed, in part because of lower-than-expected tax revenues from resource development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Premier's plan was revealed in B.C.'s Speech from the Throne, which, from a news perspective, was one of the thinnest in ages. It is Ms. Clark's plan to run on a balanced budget, which will be tabled next week. Given the somewhat fragile state of the province's finances, this balanced-budget promise has consequences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is little money available to make the kind of vote-friendly offerings one usually sees a government dangling before the electorate in the run-up to an election. The Throne Speech was devoid of any. Ms. Clark's campaign platform will focus on job creation and responsible stewardship of the economy. Balancing the budget is a key part of establishing the government's credentials in this area. And so, it would appear, is the vow to create a Prosperity Fund that the government says would be called upon to – among other things – pay down a cumulative provincial debt that sits at about $56-billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the short term, however, it will be used primarily to help get the Liberals another term in office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given how the rest of Canada has always looked longingly at Alberta's Heritage Fund, Ms. Clark's pledge to begin something similar in B.C. is sure to be well-received in many quarters. But as is the case with many of the Premier's announcements, the question is asked: Is it good policy or just good politics? Perhaps more to the point, is this idea based on sound economics or the kind of pie-in-the-sky metrics that formed the foundation of her recently announced – and quickly dismissed – plans for a 10-year labour agreement with the province's teachers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers that form the basis of the Prosperity Fund proposal look impressive enough. The Liberals insist that liquefied natural gas development will trigger about $1-trillion in cumulative gross domestic product over the next 30 years. Of this, more than $100-billion would flow into the fund. This, we're told, is based on the most conservative estimates of the number and size of LNG plants to be built in the province and the price of natural gas over that period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But three decades is a long way out. Even a few years can be, as the Alberta government is discovering. B.C. has already been battered by lower-than-expected revenues from natural gas production. It could happen again. And again. LNG competitors like Australia could beat B.C. to lucrative markets in Asia. There is a lot of uncertainty and a lot of if-everything-goes-according-to-plan belief underlying the government's forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Prosperity Fund is a wonderful idea but it's nothing more than that right now – an idea. There will be no legislation introduced to support it before the election, so we'll have no idea how it will actually work or what, if any, safeguards would be put in place to protect it from being raided by governments needing to pay for mistakes or pet projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Throne Speech, Ms. Clark's government held out the prospect such a trust could one day be used to eliminate the provincial sales tax. In other words, the kind of tantalizing promise that is pure gold on the campaign trail. At this rate, the Premier could soon be holding out hope that her rainy-day reserve might one day be used to buy everyone in the province a new car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, it's the Premier's hope it will provide her with the kind of big, feel-good brainstorm that resonates with voters. And in this case, there doesn't need to be a penny in it for her to reap some electoral rewards.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They say that home is where the heart is. My heart is in Wadena, Sask., and so is my home. Wadena is where I reside in my home province.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wadena, population 1,500, is one of many small towns in the farm country of eastern Saskatchewan. And it's a 21/2-hour drive from the airport in either Saskatoon or Regina.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was actually born in Moose Jaw, where Mom was visiting her mom, and I arrived a little early. But from that moment on, I grew up in Wadena. My parents and sister live there, as do her two married daughters. There's a street named after me and a sign on the outskirts proclaiming, “Home of Pamela Wallin.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, I spent 168 days in my home province, not just with family but participating in dozens and dozens of events. I gave speeches, moderated or took part in panel discussions, presented Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medals to veterans and other deserving Saskatchewanians, led a military dedication ceremony at Dafoe and attended many, many other events such as dinners and barbecues. That is my job, and I love doing it. I spend every possible minute I can at my home in Wadena or at my cabin at Fishing Lake during the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I also spent 94 days in Ottawa fulfilling my Senate duties. And as reporters have “discovered,” I own a condo – just one – in Toronto. I do. It's the place where I worked for many of my years on national television before going to New York as the Canadian consul-general after 9/11. As my friends say, I actually live on airplanes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate has a real matter to wrestle with over this question of residency, as set out long ago in the Constitution. Back then, rail was the main way politicians got around. Needless to say, those who lived far from Ottawa seldom went home because of the distances and time involved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The airplane changed all that. Now, although it can be exhausting, my political colleagues and I can and do commute and fly home for weekends and during parliamentary breaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This raises another point concerning questions about “high” travel expenses. The Senate's policy is not based on dollar amounts – although dollar amounts are what are reported – so senators who live in the West or the North have higher bills than those who commute to Montreal or Toronto. The system is based on annual travel points per senator, so we are all treated equally – we have the same number of flights, regardless of distance. And I have never exceeded my designated points. If I did, I'd be on the hook for any costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have been asked about attendance. Senators are permitted to be away from the chamber for as many as 21 personal leave days per parliamentary session (this one started in June, 2011) for things like bereavement, family matters, religious holidays and such. If you miss more, you are docked $250 per day. I've never exceeded the rules here, either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are some of the things I hope people will consider during this latest hue and cry about senators. There are people and political parties with axes to grind – such as seeking the abolition of the Senate. Fair enough, but understand that the Senate is what it is because that's the way Canada's founders established it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wisely, the government has submitted a list of questions about Senate reform to the Supreme Court, and we can only hope this will move the process along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those of us who believe change is necessary are still committed, even more so now. And I, like other recent appointees, have voluntarily agreed to term limits, even though the legislation has yet to pass. I think that will prove a key reform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is an honour to serve in the Senate, and I will continue to work just as hard as I can in my limited time here to serve the province and the people I love.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax-free savings accounts can do something that decades of complaining seniors have been unable to accomplish.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deploy a TFSA properly today and you can reduce the OAS clawback or put it to rest entirely when you retire years from now. No more worrying about this annoying but actually inconsequential measure that's meant to conserve the Old Age Security benefit for people who really need it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 2013, the government starts clawing back OAS benefits when your net income exceeds $70,954. “That's a healthy income in retirement,” said Jason Watt, an Edmonton-based trainer of financial advisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I like to joke that, at that level, you're not eating cat food.” OAS benefits are completely offset by the clawback with an income of $114,640.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Human Resources Social Development Canada issued some figures a few years ago showing just 5 per cent of Canadians were affected by the clawback, and that 2 per cent lost their benefit entirely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the clawback is equivalent to just 15 per cent of the amount by which your net income exceeds $70,954.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Watt said income taxes take a much bigger bite than that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet, the clawback has rankled seniors ever since it was introduced in 1989 for people with net income over $50,000. The clawback was indexed in 2000 so that the threshold where it applies rises at the inflation rate each year, but seniors still feel ripped off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In part, that's a result of a misunderstanding how OAS works. It's not like the Canada Pension Plan, where workers and their employers actually put money into the plan. OAS is funded out of general tax revenues, which means it's supported by all taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One answer to the clawback is to make peace with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe it will help to know that the average after-tax income for families where the major income earner is 65 or older was $56,200 in 2010, the most recent year for which there are data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To repeat: If you're in clawback territory, you're in good shape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another way to deal with the clawback is to use TFSAs to render it irrelevant. Some quick background: Unlike withdrawals from registered retirement savings plans and registered retirement income funds, money taken out of TFSAs is not considered taxable income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Partner an RRSP and a TFSA as retirement savings vehicles and you could end up with actual income that is significantly higher than the taxable income relevant to both your tax rate and the OAS clawback threshold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TFSAs were introduced in 2009 and the original $5,000 contribution limit was just this year bumped up to $5,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Watt says a couple retiring today has $51,000 in contribution room, which would have only a modest effect on their ability to fend off the clawback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When we get to 10 or 15 years down the road and couples are retiring with $100,000 or $200,000 in their TFSAs, then it's going to change things,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And for a young client, if you're mixing TFSAs and RRSPs properly, then you're controlling your income so nicely that the clawback becomes almost irrelevant.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A simple rule for weighing retirement savings vehicles: Compare your current tax rate with your anticipated rate in retirement. If you expect your current tax rate to be higher, that argues for using RRSPs over TFSAs. Some people may prefer RRSPs because of the tax refund they get when they make a contribution, even though they'll pay tax when money is withdrawn in retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With TFSAs, you contribute after-tax dollars and thus have no worries about your withdrawals being dinged by the taxman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still not sure about RRSPs and TFSAs for retirement?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Watt suggests you consider the flexibility of TFSAs, which are not bound by the annual minimum withdrawal requirements that apply to RRIFs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RRIF-holders complain about these withdrawals almost as much as the clawback, and in this case they have a fair point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They may end up taking money out of their RRIF to satisfy the withdrawal rules, thereby triggering the clawback. With a TFSA, you withdraw what you want, when you want. Whereas withdrawals from a RRIF have to be carefully arranged with the investment firm where it's held, TFSA withdrawals can be done online as a basic electronic transfer from one account to another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TFSA: no muss, no fuss and potentially no clawback. Give it some thought.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lent is about enduring a period of fasting, repentance and moderation. In other words, you give up certain indulgences. You just stop. So here we are in Lent, and there are things that you, I and others should just stop doing. Where to start?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking Lena Dunham too seriously. Let's stop that. I've said it before and I'll say it again: Girls is a comedy. It can be a black comedy, a poignant comedy or a whimsical comedy, but it's still a comedy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seriousness of the attention paid to both Dunham and Girls is now an overindulgence. It's ridiculous. Discussion of last Sunday's episode, in which Dunham's character, Hannah, spent a few days with that doctor guy in his plush house, has become so earnest, it reeks of extravagant oversincerity and overreach. Yeah, yeah, Hannah goes around half-naked or fully naked, showing a body that looks rather different from that of most female characters on TV. Big deal. It doesn't shift the universe. (Does it occur to anyone that Hannah looks rather like one of the young women in Honey Boo Boo's family? Think about it.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those who obsess, it might be better to speculate on the reaction if there was a gender reversal. Suppose the male equivalent body of a young man was on such display and he was having a fling with a comely fortysomething female doctor? It would be seen as a comedy, wouldn't it? Girls is a comedy, so quit the avid, pompous obsessing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking Downton Abbey too seriously. God bless my soul, great Scott and heavens to Betsy, but this thing is no masterpiece, and it doesn't matter if PBS labels it “Masterpiece Classic.” It's hokum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are two kinds of dogmatic devotees of Downton, I think.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First there are those who think it's historically accurate. They believe that rich but very nice people traipsed around saying, “Well, well, the world is changing, by Jove! And we must change with it.” Not true. Most of the English aristocracy resisted change and resented it. Usually they plotted to stop it, keep the servants and tradesmen in their place and cling to their entitlements. Fools who see veracity in Downton need to quit pampering themselves with this daydream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there are those who imagine themselves living in the Downton world. The clothes, the cars, the big house with the gorgeous furniture. This is the worst sort of indulgent delusion. Sure, the clothes are nice, but remember the confinement that came with them. The incarceration inside a rigid class system. Nice to be able to fantasize about the wealth and beauty of it all. But it's like a bad sugar high. Give it up for Lent, if it's your indulgence. It's what Lent is for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excuse my sternness. I'm not truly asking for a Lent of total fasting and repentance. Just a little moderation. You get to return to immoderate obsessing come Easter.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zero Hour (ABC, Global, 8 p.m.) is the convoluted new drama I told you about yesterday.

Anthony Edwards returns to TV as Hank Galliston, who is entangled in the most elaborate of international and ancient of conspiracies, after his wife is kidnapped. You get a bad guy and a kidnapping and by the end of the pilot you're inside a plot more elaborate than The Da Vinci Code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars &amp; Venus Today (CBC, 9 p.m. on Doc Zone) is a documentary that looks at the book by John Gray, Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus, 20 years after its publication.

The doc promises an answer to this question: “Does this book help us solve the mystery of the opposite sex or does it throw us back to the fifties and only perpetuate gender stereotypes?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glee (Fox, Global, 9 p.m.) has a Valentine-themed episode. Will and Emma finally get married. There's a lot of singing and dancing. And in the case of Will and Emma, one imagines it as a musical version of The Big Bang Theory (CBS, CTV, 8 p.m.), which tonight involves the guys buying Valentine's gifts.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘America is all about immigrants,” Jarmo Kekalainen said on a conference call Wednesday. “People coming into the country, looking for the great opportunities the country has to offer.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you believe “opportunity” can be roughly translated into “massive, daunting, thankless challenge,” then Kekalainen is correct. He has inherited one of the greatest opportunities in the south-of-the-49th parallel NHL: trying to turn the moribund, dysfunctional <span class="companylink">Columbus Blue Jackets</span> into something resembling a playoff contender. Kekalainen made history when he was appointed by team president John Davidson as the next Blue Jackets general manager – the first European to hold such a post in the NHL – replacing Scott Howson, who'd been fired less than 24 hours before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In explaining the decision to hire Kekalainen, Davidson noted “hockey is truly a global game” and “30 per cent of its players” hail from outside North America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All true, but make no mistake about Davidson's motives here. As much as he is a progressive thinker, he didn't hire Kekalainen to break barriers or forge a pioneering path. He hired Kekalainen because of his résumé – and the floundering <span class="companylink">Blue Jackets</span> are desperately in need of the skills he brings to the job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Columbus is sputtering near the bottom of the NHL standings, again, but the <span class="companylink">Blue Jackets</span> have three first-round picks in the 2013 entry draft: their own, plus ones acquired from the <span class="companylink">New York Rangers</span> (Rick Nash trade) and <span class="companylink">Los Angeles Kings</span> (Jeff Carter trade).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the hardest things to get right in the NHL is to pick winners in the second half of the first round, where you can strikeout as easily as you can hit a home run. In Kekalainen's time with the <span class="companylink">St. Louis Blues</span> (assistant GM from 2002-10), they hit a lot of homers: T.J. Oshie, 25th in 2005; Patrik Berglund, 25th in 2006; and David Perron, 26th in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be fair, the Blues weren't perfect at the draft table in that time. No team is. (St. Louis would probably like a do-over on Erik Johnson, first overall in 2006.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when the Blues turned it around last year, and finished two points off the overall NHL lead, it was largely because of their crop of homegrown players. More impressively, they did it on a budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kekalainen started his managerial career as a part-time scout for the <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span>. He spent seven years (1995-2002) in their hockey operations department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philosophically, Kekalainen believes some elements of player evaluation are obvious to anybody watching – how a player skates, how a player shoots. The more challenging part of the equation is assessing how a player thinks. Kekalainen noted some people believe quickness comes from the feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The better the hockey gets, the higher the level gets – and the NHL is the highest level – the quickness comes from the head,” Kekalainen said. “That's the hardest part to evaluate, and so, it takes a lot of hard work. I think that's what scouting's all about. Nobody's a super scout in my opinion. There are just scouts who work real hard and then there are scouts that don't do as good a job with that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It not rocket science. It's just hard work.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kekalainen had wanted to be an NHL GM for a long time, and left St. Louis in 2010 to run the Finnish team Jokerit after then-Blues boss Davidson elected to go with Doug Armstrong to replace Larry Pleau as GM.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barriers don't always topple easily in the NHL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took decades following the first European invasion of players before the unofficial quota system disappeared. There were teams which believed you couldn't win with European players – or too many European players. There have been a few teams that hired European head coaches without much success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kekalainen's chances of succeeding are greater because he'll start with an organization with nowhere to go but up. Still, if the goal is to build through the draft, there will be times in the next few years when what he described as his “dream job” might seem a little nightmarish.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other day I gave a talk to a parents' group at a boys' school. It was a big group. I asked them if they'd ever known a boy who hadn't made a pretend gun with his fingers and gone bang-bang. Not a single hand went up.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No surprise there. Boys have been fighting with pretend weapons since the dawn of time. Mock battles and mock violence are a normal part of boyhood. But in the age of zero tolerance and Sandy Hook, society is in a panic. Some parents won't allow water guns in the house. Even Nerf Blasters aren't okay. “[Parents] think it's innocuous because it's a cartoon,” one critic of toy guns told The New York Times. “But they're buying something that is reinforcing shooting.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, a five-year-old Massachusetts boy was threatened with a two-week suspension from his after-school program for making a gun from Lego bricks. “Pointing a gun and making shooting sounds can be uncomfortable to somebody. And it's not respectful,” explained the earnest school superintendent in an interview with ABC. In Maryland, a six-year-old was suspended for one day for – yes – pointing his finger like a gun. His parents hired a lawyer to have the suspension removed from his permanent record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The punishment of boys for being boys proceeds apace. But what happens to them on the playground is the least of it. What happens in the classroom is worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New evidence suggests that boys are penalized from the day they first set foot in school. A new study (whose findings were first reported by Christina Hoff Sommers, writing in The New York Times) finds that boys get lower grades than girls across the board – not because their schoolwork is inferior, but because they don't behave like girls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study, which was published in The Journal of Human Resources, compared the standardized test scores of thousands of kids in kindergarten through Grade 5 with the grades their teachers gave them. Overall, girls outperformed boys on reading tests, boys outperformed girls on science tests, and boys and girls scored about the same in math. But no matter what the subject, the boys' grades did not reflect their test scores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Boys who perform equally as well as girls on reading, math and science tests are graded less favourably by their teachers,” the authors write. Why? Because of differences in “non-cognitive development” – that is, behaviour. In general, girls are much better at sitting still, paying attention and co-operation – all the traits that teachers value. Boys lose points because of that. And the bias against boys, the study found, begins in kindergarten.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why does this matter? Because how you do in school increasingly dictates how you will do in the world. And grading strongly influences grade-level placement, high-school graduation and university admission prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people argue that it's only fair to mark boys down for deportment. To me, that's gender bias. It's like saying that women aren't as promotable as men because they don't behave the way men do in the workplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's no surprise that schools subtly discriminate against boys. After all, they are increasingly run by women – women who, as girls, were extremely good at sitting still, paying attention and co-operating. The schools have become more and more hostile to boys' inclinations and interests. They have abolished competition in favour of co-operation – even though boys thrive on competition. They've outlawed rough-and-tumble play (too dangerous) and even cancelled recess altogether. In high school, they bore boys to death instead of teaching them how to make and build stuff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the most successful schools today (also cited by Ms. Sommers) is New York City's Aviation High School, whose students are mostly minority boys from low-income families. Students spend half the day in standard classes and the other half studying technical subjects such as aviation hydraulics and aircraft engines. They wear coveralls and practise on real planes. The school day is long, and graduation rates are exceptionally high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have a good community-college system in Canada. But that comes too late for a lot of boys. We need a massive reinvention of vocational schools, turning them from dumping grounds into places where boys can learn and thrive. Boys will be boys. Work with it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've always had a soft spot for Detroit.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My feelings for the city took root at a young age. I sometimes summered at my aunt and uncle's home in Dearborn, a Detroit suburb. The first Major League Baseball game I ever attended was at Tiger Stadium. I was 10 and would never forget how the freshly watered outfield grass, a green colour I hadn't known before, glistened in the afternoon sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Detroit introduced me to facts of life I would only come to understand years later. Like the day I went to take a drink at a public fountain in a downtown department store. It was the early 1960s, and I was maybe 8 or 9 at the time. I was quickly shooed away by a tall white woman who told me I didn't want to be sipping from that tap. There was another one across the floor for children like me, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In my teenaged years, growing up in Sarnia, Ont., my buddies and I would make pilgrimages to the Motor City to see bands that were never going to come to our little part of the world. Often, we would drive our overloaded van into some of the worst parts of the city, blissfully unaware of the dangers that lurked. We passed by buildings destroyed years earlier in the 1967 riot. Most of them sat scarred and boarded up, stagnant reminders of the deep-seated problems plaguing the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Problems, it turns out, that only got worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Detroit is facing Chapter 9 bankruptcy. On Wednesday, embattled Mayor Dave Bing, whom I once regularly watched dribble a basketball up the floor for the NBA's <span class="companylink">Detroit Pistons</span>, offered up a last-ditch plan to avoid a seemingly inevitable outcome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city has outstanding debt of almost $14-billion. <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> recently downgraded Detroit's bond rating deeper into junk status. Under Mr. Bing, elected in 2009 on a promise to clean up the mess at City Hall once and for all, the operating deficit exploded to more than $326-million in fiscal 2012 from just under $200-million a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, this problem has been building for years. Detroit has been plagued by incompetent and/or corrupt management at City Hall for decades. As the city faces bankruptcy, former mayor Kwame Kilpatrick is standing trial for effectively running a criminal enterprise from his office and bilking taxpayers out of tens of thousands of dollars. At one time, people thought Mr. Kilpatrick was going to be the saviour who helped get the city's lost mojo back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, like so many before him, he let it down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many ways, Detroit's decline paralleled that of the city's Big Three automakers – Chrysler, <span class="companylink">General Motors</span> and Ford. For years, nobody wanted their lousy, gas-guzzling cars, preferring instead the superior and more fuel-efficient products being made in Japan and elsewhere. When the Great Recession of 2008 hit, the U.S. government was forced to step in to manage the bankruptcies and restructuring of GM and Chrysler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, all three are making better cars and posting better results. Chrysler, in fact, recently announced a nine-fold increase in profits since 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when the recession hit, and the car manufacturers shed thousands of jobs, even more people left Detroit. At one time, it was the fifth-largest city in the United States. Now, it's the 18th, with about 700,000 citizens. The jobless numbers sit at a miserable 18 per cent – more than twice the national average. Meanwhile, the murder rate remains one of the country's highest, something that has always been one of the city's more notorious calling cards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, people in Detroit talk about the stigma attached to bankruptcy, something they say would tarnish the city's image in the eyes of the broader world. Fact is, the city's brand could not be any more blackened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bankruptcy would be ugly. There would be cuts to public services. There would be dramatic work-force reductions. Labour contracts would be ripped up. There would be shocking reductions in the pay and benefits of city employees, of which there are many. But there is really no other way out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Decades of ill-conceived decisions, blatant political corruption and depressing fiscal mismanagement have finally caught up with the city. In order to live, Detroit may first have to die.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Literary media have been abuzz about the “sick-lit” controversy: novels written for teenagers with themes of death, fatal disease and psychological disease such as anorexia. Apparently these are very popular with girls in Britain and North America. Detractors say they are dangerous because they romanticize these things, especially cancer; they encourage wallowing in depression and may actually encourage vulnerable children to harm themselves.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A novel called The Fault in Our Stars, by John Green, usually serves as epitome of the genre. It's about Hazel, a 16-year-old cancer patient who meets a really cute guy in a cancer support group. He is an amputee and also dying. They fall in love, he dies, she survives. After his death she finds notes the boy had been writing for her own eulogy. The story ends with her saying to the absent lover, “I do.” The book was well-reviewed and became a bestseller. Similar sick-lit books include Never Eighteen, and Before I Die (now a movie called Now is Good starring Dakota Fanning), both about teenage cancer sufferers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are whole imprints of publishing houses devoted to so-called “young adult” (YA) fiction, and they are retooling their arsenals, shifting the paradigm from werewolves and wizards to hospitals and suicide plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The criticism of these books comes from all directions, right and left: The sensationalist Daily Mail published a piece accusing sick-lit of encouraging inappropriate behaviour for teens, such as premarital sex. The Guardian's teen lit critic retorted, “illness, depression, sexuality – these are all issues that teens are going to bump up against in their lives.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One particularly vocal opponent of the illness romance trend is a critic for The Times of London. British novelist Amanda Craig was on the CBC radio show The Current last month, arguing that the glamorization of victimhood that these books offer can lead isolated teens into self-destructive behaviour. Craig had told the Daily Mail she had already seen the result of this, when a 12-year-old girl she knew read a YA novel called Red Tears, about a girl who self-harms. Craig claims the book spread “like wildfire” in the girl's class, causing several other girls to try self-mutilation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craig herself admits that sick children have long been useful plot devices in sentimental fiction – one could point to authors Louisa May Alcott, Charles Dickens and Johanna Spyri (Heidi). Supporters of the genre add that adult fiction deals with scary and violent stories in even less sensitive fashion; when are clever teens allowed to read those?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This whole discussion could never have happened 40 years ago, when there was no such thing as YA fiction. There was children's fiction and then there was fiction. Children's fiction was wholesome or propagandistic. When I was done with the Narnia and Hornblower series I moved right on to Kafka, which was far more troublingly violent and grim, perfect for a teenager with an interest in the weird and gross. I still think if you have a teenager who wants disturbing stories, it's far healthier to just give her Kafka. Throw her in at the deep end, I say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Note that everybody accepts that we're just talking about girls here. Obviously the sick-lit genre is a sub-genre of romance, and boys are not expected to read it or slice themselves up in response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this it is representative of a general trend in publishing, which is toward silos. That is, books are being produced in ever more strictly defined categories. The Narnia books were for both genders and had compelling boy and girl characters. (To their credit, so do the Harry Potter books.) And then we had Jane Austen and Kafka for everybody over 14, regardless of gender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now we have a lot of labelled categories. We have a whole shelf for paranormal romance. We have a shelf for erotica, as if most fiction isn't erotic. We have more than one YA subsection in bookstores: the 11-to-14 books are supposed to be different from the 14-and-over teen books. The girls' books are separate from the … wait, there are no boys' books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that I want there to be “boys' books.” Categories are divisive. Should we have a separate shelf for satire? For prairie novels? This kind of hiving off of audiences encourages people to stay in their literary comfort zones, and it perpetuates gender stereotypes. It is bad for literature and bad for culture.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North Korea's latest action follows behaviour over the past decade that makes Iran look restrained in comparison. Pyongyang walked away from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 2003; resisted serious negotiations at the six-party talks that year with the United States, China, Russia, South Korea and Japan; tested nuclear explosive devices in 2006 and 2009 despite a global moratorium; conducted increasingly provocative missile tests; ignored <span class="companylink">United Nations Security Council</span> resolutions and sanctions; sank a South Korean navy ship and shelled one of its islands in 2010; and maintained a flow of belligerent rhetoric.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this has rattled nerves yet again in South Korea and particularly in Japan. There is new talk about countering what is perceived as an increasingly sophisticated threat. It is still not permissible in polite company to talk about these front-line states acquiring their own nuclear weapons. But putting U.S. weapons back into South Korea, acquiring real missile capability, allowing reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, moving closer to breakout capability – these steps now have advocates, and the voices will grow louder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor has North Korea's behaviour done anything to help the cause of global non-proliferation and disarmament. It has successfully thumbed its nose at international pressure, becoming a beacon to small, vulnerable, badly behaved states whose leaders want to believe that nuclear weapons will buy them immunity from intervention – and that Iraq's and Libya's biggest mistake was to fail to acquire them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major downsizing of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, which President Barack Obama wants to achieve, will become politically more difficult. America's plan to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in its security strategy, including defending its regional allies, will be harder to implement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inevitably, this will all translate into calls for a tougher stance against Kim Jong-un's regime – less diplomacy and more sanctions, punitive measures and isolation. How can anyone talk about incentives or normalizing relations with a regime so demonstrably recalcitrant?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less inevitably, but more alarmingly, there may now be greater tolerance for those who argue that a country has a right to defend itself against existential threats with equally threatening weapons, or that a world of multiple nuclear powers would be less, not more, dangerous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such responses would be serious overreactions. At a general level, Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, William Perry and Sam Nunn were right to argue that, whatever might have been during the Cold War, a 21st-century world of multiple competing nuclear powers would be one of massively enhanced global risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The core message of the NPT must continue to resonate: So long as anyone has nuclear weapons, others will want them; so long as anyone has them, they are bound one day to be used, by accident or miscalculation, if not by design; and any such use would be catastrophic, not just for the states immediately affected, but for life on this planet. For that message to resonate, the major nuclear-armed states must not only remain committed to non-proliferation, but also get serious about disarmament.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of North Korea, the world must of course register its displeasure. There will, and should be, Security Council condemnation and measures taken to cause the regime, if not its long-suffering people, genuine pain. But the door should be kept wide open for negotiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before rushing to conclude that no productive normalization and denuclearization talks with North Korea are possible, we need to revisit the record. World leaders signed the Agreed Framework with North Korea in 1994, but we dragged our feet in building the reactors and delivering the heavy fuel oil we promised, partly owing to a widespread belief that the regime's collapse was imminent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The diplomatic trajectory re-established a few years later was halted by George W. Bush's “Axis of Evil” declaration in 2002. When a potential new deal was negotiated by the <span class="companylink">U.S. State Department</span> in 2005, Treasury officials slammed that window shut by warning the world's banks against conducting transactions with any North Korean entity. The Sunshine Policy, which for a decade sustained hope of North-South reconciliation, ended abruptly with President Lee Myung-bak's election in South Korea in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The North Koreans are erratic, unpleasant, irresponsible and unhelpful. But they don't bear all the blame for the past and are not behaving completely irrationally. New administrations, free of baggage, are in place in the relevant regional capitals. If they, the United States and Russia stay calm, place enough on the table and demand same, diplomacy may move forward, and the future may not be irredeemably bleak.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the survey of 103,000 students between grades 7 and 12 may suggest there is cause for concern, and it could be a wake-up call to prompt parents to pay attention to how their children are coping with their lives. But the survey of the emotional and social well-being of students is the first of its kind by the Toronto District School Board, so there are no data to show whether stress levels have been changing or teenagers' mental health is deteriorating. As a result, the data cannot tell us if their lives are more stressful than in the past, or just typically stressful but for different reasons.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teens are undeniably facing new pressures, including complex social-media interactions, rising university admission standards and soaring tuition levels. The survey found 73 per cent of students between grades 9 and 12 report they are worried about their futures, while 70 per cent said they were worried about school work and 46 per cent said they were stressed about “family matters.” Among the high-school cohort, 38 per cent said they are always or often “under a lot of stress,” 35 per cent say they often have trouble concentrating, 29 per cent often lose sleep because of their worries, and 11 per cent reported they often feel like crying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those numbers cannot be ignored. But it is entirely possible that students in bygone decades could have reported similar overall stress levels. Very possibly, adults would report the same trends. And it's not even necessarily a bad thing. Learning to cope with stress is an age-old part of maturing to adulthood, and stress can be positive when it is a driver for achievement. Moreover, the data must be tempered with other survey findings that found 70 per cent of high-school students (and 80 per cent of those in grades 7 and 8) reported feeling good about themselves, and 67 per cent said they felt “reasonably happy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, the survey's greatest practical value may be the help it can provide in identifying those individuals, schools or age groups whose mental health appears worse than these new “normal” baseline data suggest. Officials cannot erase stress from students' lives, but they can focus on those who are overwhelmed by their stress and target support programs where they are most needed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, the Toronto Sun recently reported, Mayor Rob Ford sent a memo to his office staff telling them to sign in when they come to work. For the mayor's office to function at its “optimal level,” the memo explained, his executive assistant had to know “where staff may be during the business day.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To those who follow the mayor, that was pretty rich. His own attendance at city hall is spotty at best. On many days, no one can say where he is or what he is doing. As The Globe and Mail's Elizabeth Church put it, “the mayor's comings and goings are a mystery at city hall.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not just coaching football that keeps him away. The mayor's schedule, obtained by Ms. Church through a freedom-of-information request, shows that long after the football season came to an end this fall, he appeared to knock off at 3:30 p.m. most days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mayor brushes off the report. He told Newstalk1010 radio that “I just laugh” when people say he doesn't work hard. He said he returns 50 to 70 calls a day from voters and is sometimes up calling people as late as midnight. His spokesman says that Mr. Ford often attends events or works by phone on weekends and evenings, so he takes “private time” many afternoons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fair enough. We all need a little work-life balance and no one expects him to work 16 hours a day. But a mayor who promises more transparent government owes it to the city to be clearer about his movements. And a mayor who promises more efficient government ought to have more disciplined work habits. To borrow from Mr. Ford himself, it is hard for his administration to function at “optimal level” if people don't know where he is half the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike mayors before him, he doesn't put out an official schedule. The press often gets little or no notice even when he is going to public events. It is not uncommon to ask his press secretary where the mayor is or what his plans are and get no response whatever. It is hardly an invasion of privacy to ask. Doesn't the public have the right to know how their mayor spends his work time?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's all a little absurd, and completely unnecessary. Mayors of most other big cities are much more up-front about their doings. When reporters followed Mr. Ford to Chicago for a business trip last fall, Mayor Rahm Emanuel's pleasant and efficient press team told them where and when Mr. Emanuel would appear and what he would talk about. It was brisk, transparent and professional.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, the media have to go through the freedom-of-information process just to find out what the mayor does with his day. Even then, they don't get much. Many time slots in the schedule released this week are marked simply “meetings” or “events.” On Monday, Dec. 10, it reads: 9-10 a.m. – private; 10-11 a.m. – Mayor's daily briefing; 11 a.m.-12 p.m. – meetings; 12-1 p.m. – office/reading/correspondence; 3:30-4:30 p.m. – private; 5:30-6:30 p.m. – private; 7-8 p.m. – calls/events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back when he was just a city councillor, Mr. Ford could get away with his practice of drifting in and out of city hall, a disengaged, half-there figure. Things are different now. He is mayor of a city of 2.7 million. In work as in life, part of the trick is simply showing up. Toronto deserves more than a half-there mayor.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, the Chinese government will probably not take sufficient action until Kim Jong-un and his associates go even further.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a bit encouraging that Global Times, a Chinese daily newspaper ultimately controlled by the Communist Party, with a populist or nationalist rather than a liberal bent, published an editorial in late January, saying that China would “not hesitate to reduce its assistance” to North Korea if it performs further nuclear tests, and that China should pursue its own interests, not Pyongyang's.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When we talk about health care in this country it is all too often in Chicken-Little-esque terms: The aging population will bankrupt us, drug costs are out of control, health care is gobbling such a large proportion of provincial budgets that there's no money left for anything else and other overheated rhetoric.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it is refreshing to see the Conference Board of Canada, in a recent report, remind us there is a flip side of the coin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The health sector, public and private (and let's not forget we have plenty of both), is an economic driver, a generator of wealth, a source of good-paying jobs and a stabilizer in times of economic upheaval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, one of the most intriguing aspects of the new report is the reminder that, while health spending has outpaced economic growth for three decades, it has also served as a ballast in tough economic times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's political leaders like to brag that Canada weathered the global recession a lot better than many other countries (and the U.S. in particular) because of sound fiscal management and a well-regulated banking sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is too often neglected is the role of the health sector – and the universal health insurance program in particular – in this equation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a telling graphic, the Conference Board charts the growth (actually shrinkage) of the economy from 2007 to 2012 and, alongside, the slow and steady growth of the health sector in the same period. You can clearly see an offsetting effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The message here is clear: Universal health care helps make Canada recession-proof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board report also reminds us of the sheer magnitude of the health sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is, in economic terms, about the same size as the manufacturing sector, more than 10 per cent of gross domestic product. Health care plays an even more important role in poor parts of the country: 13.2 per cent of GDP in Nova Scotia, for example, compared to 7.6 per cent in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1,200 hospitals across the country are often among the largest employers in their cities and towns, and the other 93,000 ambulatory care centres (dentists' offices, optometrists, community health centres, etc.) that we take for granted stabilize the tax base in addition to providing key services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the health-care sector employs one in every 11 workers – 1.6 million direct jobs and another 500,000 indirect jobs. And let's not forget that they are good-paying jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those 2.1 million recession-proof jobs, as much as anything, mitigated the effects of the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total compensation for health workers was $127-billion, just shy of $60,000 per job. Those workers paid a lot of taxes, just as the purchase of health goods and services generates sales taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, the health sector generates $30.6-billion in tax revenues annually. For every $5 Canadians spend on health, government gets back at least $1 in taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while the Conference Board analysis is strictly an economic one, let's not forget that, in countries with universal health-care systems such as Canada, the health-insurance system contributes greatly to a more stable and productive work force, reduces absenteeism and generally leaves people healthier and more apt to work. (So, too, do many other redistributive social programs, but that's a discussion for another day.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, none of this suggests we cannot deliver health care more efficiently and cost effectively. On the contrary. We shouldn't advocate spending for the sake of spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, as we engage in talk of health reform in the years to come, as the rhetoric about our “unsustainable” health system heats up, let's not lose sight of the fact that the $200-billion Canadians spend each year on health care is not just shovelled into a big black pit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's actually good medicine for the country's economy, especially when the economy is ailing.</p>

She e-mailed me to say, “I can't help but think this is about me and I'm hurt.” I responded that it wasn't about her and I wasn't in a place to worry about the feelings of others. She snapped and wrote that I shouldn't lash out at someone who is on her own every minute of every day and how she's always there for everyone else (my husband and I helped her a lot the first year). How do I move past this sore point in our relationship? Or do I need to abandon it until she gets her life figured out?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ANSWER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No, no, no. You need to be patient. As George Costanza says in Seinfeld (talking to a priest, at a funeral, while loading canapés and sandwiches onto his plate): “Losing a loved one is, uh … I mean, forget about it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tough, in other words. True, I can envision an upside for my own wife, Pam, after 20 years: less crap strewn around the house, fewer dishes, king-sized bed all to herself, and no one to pull the blankets off her in the middle of the night. And mourning would become her: She has always looked good in black. Alternate suitors would no doubt descend upon her like darkness on a mountain village before my corpse was even cool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But my point is: After the first rush of relief had passed, if Pam were to experience some grief, and that grief were to cause her to behave erratically or even divaliciously, I would hope her friends would be patient with her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As you should be patient with your friend. Now, I understand that you feel you have your own issues, and they're always being trumped by her playing the “widow card.” Teenager struggling? At least you're not a widow. Sick in bed? At least you're not a widow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I can see how that could become tiresome after a while. She's taking away your God-given right to complain – and that's what separates us from the animals! But here's the thing: You have plenty of other people to complain to, right? Take a moment to try to imagine how she feels. Don't you think she might feel as though her problems do indeed dwarf/trump yours right now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be blunt, I'm getting kind of a Real Housewives of Vancouver/drama queen-type vibe here. I mean, posting a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> message about the people you feel are contributing to your anxiety? Isn't that a bit like trying to solve your hornet problem by poking the hive with a pointy stick?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could the real problem be two drama queens vying for attention in an enclosure that contains enough air for only one?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You need to settle down. Be there for her. In all seriousness, if I were widowed, I would lean a lot on my friends – in a way I know would try their patience. But I also know they would be patient and tolerant of me. You should be that kind of friend too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Being a widow is a tricky combination of looking back, reflecting on, and nursing the wounds from the past – and finding a way to move forward into the future. You need to help her both look back and move forward, a process as difficult metaphorically as it is in real life. She will have good days and bad. Encourage her on the good ones, be compassionate on the bad ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My other piece of advice is to take her advice and count your blessings. You and your husband are lucky to have one another. In the midst of all the problems life throws at you, remember to be grateful for that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, down the line, and sorry to be blunt again, maybe you and your friend could both get over yourselves a bit. It's true that death puts your other problems in perspective – which is why my ultimate sympathy in this tale of woe-is-me, no-woe-is-me is with the dude in the coffin. In the midst of all the back-and-forth contention for attention, he seems to have been forgotten.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If he could speak, I could imagine him saying, emitting a puff of dust: “What about me? I'm the one with the biggest problem.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What am I supposed to do now?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carl Honoré has written himself into an ironic pickle.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The author of the 2004's international bestseller, In Praise of Slow, which was published just as the world was beginning to worry about how speed-addicted it had become, has found his “furrow to plough” in the slow movement. The success of his first book allowed him to leave his job at The National Post, where he wrote about Europe from London, in order to consult and give talks on the dangers of thinking that fast is always better. His new book, The Slow Fix, discusses how we can think better, work better and have better relationships, if we get off the quick-fix merry-go-round and adopt slower, truer approaches – all of which he details. If the first book was a clarion call, this one is more of a how-to. Slow fixes include admitting mistakes in order to learn from them, collaboration, focusing on details (yes, sweating the small stuff), patience, thinking long term and humility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has become an expert, in other words, someone whom others seek out for short-cut – dare I say quick? – answers to their problems. How does he reconcile that position with his message?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I feel that I'm quite a humble guy,” he says, slightly taken aback, his explanation a little less smoothly delivered that his exquisite sentences on the merits of slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have chafed against [the expert role],” he continues. “I never wanted to be a public figure. I feel that I always have to dampen down people's expectations. They expect me to be an oracle, wave a magic wand, sprinkle some slow, sparkly dust on them, to make everything all right. But I don't have all the answers, and in a sense, that's the kind of tension in this iteration of my life at this stage … There's a hunger for tablets of stone set against the fact that I'm not a tablets-of-stone kind of guy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You could have fooled me. In the iteration of self he presents at a Toronto café, everything about him is chiselled: his sentences, his demeanour, his fitted, blue, three-piece suit. Of course, that's part of his message, held over from his first book: Just because you believe in slow, that doesn't mean you're a slacker or dim-witted. Despite his efforts to make it otherwise, the word is still burdened with its pejorative meanings, he acknowledges. “It helps that I'm a pretty fast person,” says the 45-year-old father of two teenagers. “My metronome is set pretty high.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His stoney expression cracks a smile, and he laughs. Honoré has a house-of-mirrors sort of personality. If he projects a professional, business-like demeanour that's not to say he isn't an easy-going guy with a healthy sense of humour. Intentionally or not, he challenges the popular idea that we should rely on our first – fast – impression of someone, a skill celebrated in Malcolm Gladwell's Blink, a book that, arguably, fed the speed addiction. Taken slowly, and given a bit of time to unfold, Honoré's personality is a quirky mix of intentions and interests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raised in Vancouver, St. John's and Edmonton, he studied at Edinburgh University in Scotland, and then set out to make a difference with his writing. “I guess I went into journalism to save the world,” he says with the sort of meek self-regard only an adult can have for his younger self. “I always felt through writing that I wanted to rotate the world slightly.” Early in his career, he worked with street children in Brazil, later reporting on poverty issues when he covered South America as a foreign correspondent. In the short biography he supplied to his publisher for his book tour, he wrote that he once won a contest for the “ugliest transvestite” during Carnival in Brazil. He wore fake eyelashes, stilettos and a plastic tiara through the throng. “I guess I wanted to break [that impression] that slow means being po-faced and a killjoy. I'm not any of those things,” he explains when asked why he included that personal anecdote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the global guru on the Slow Movement, he has resisted the temptation to set up a think tank, even though some have suggested it. After his second book, Under Pressure, which examined modern child-rearing, he teamed up with Britain's Eton College to initiate a slow approach to education. He is often approached by large multinational companies to consult on how to adopt slow practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is taking his success in a stride that suits his pace. “I could be working 300 hours a week. I just say no. The power of slow is the power of no. I can't go to every party I get invited to. I can't do every work thing.” He does yoga – part of his slow fix for a bad back. He has learned a lot about his own needs for fast and slow aspects of life after writing his first book. “There's a very clear before and after,” he explain. “I used to always feel rushed. Now I don't.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His greatest lesson in slow was writing his new book. He travelled around the world for the research, looking for the themes that connected his observations about what slow fixes entailed. “The essence of the creative process is always in the journey … I spent a lot of time just sitting with the story. It takes a long time and a willingness to drift, to let things happen, to listen. That goes against the grain. We want to know in advance.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's only now on his whirlwind book tour that he exercises his skill at uttering the quick, perfect sound bite.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirty years ago, an estimated 50 corporations controlled most of the media outlets in the United States. According to the disquieting documentary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shadows of Liberty, that number is now down to five – limiting discussion and threatening democracy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the eve of its Friday opening at Toronto's Bloor Hot Docs Cinema, its Quebec-born, London-based director, Jean-Philippe Tremblay, spoke with us by phone, warning of the “self-censorship” that media consolidation brings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your film suggests media organizations keep the truth from people to protect their corporate interests. In fact, a voiceover at the beginning promises: “These are stories you will not be told on radio, on television, in newspapers.” So, where did you hear them?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I started doing research in 2007, 2008, the <span class="companylink">U.S. Federal Communications Commission</span> (FCC) was holding hearings [into media concentration]. Speaking to people there, journalists and citizens and politicians, who are part of the cast of this film, like Robert McChesney, Amy Goodman, I started hearing these stories. They could be more well known, but they haven't been spoken about in the mainstream media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seems many have, though. For example, when you tell the story in the film about how NBC's To Catch a Predator apparently drove a man to suicide, you interview the journalist Luke Dittrich. He had written about the case for Esquire magazine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, these stories have been written about in independent media –</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Esquire is owned by <span class="companylink">Hearst Corp</span>., which is hardly “independent media.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, if I can finish my sentence – and even some of the mainstream media, absolutely. But I guess what the film also says – because this is a very complex thing to understand about the media – is, even though some stories are reported about, they're reported in a way where there's no echo chamber. The important thing is that these important issues are taken up and spoken about and repeated in different media – not just one magazine, but that they're actually reported in different mediums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seems to me you're mainly talking about TV companies: Two of the big five companies you mention – <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> and <span class="companylink">NewsCorp</span> – have a few print outlets, but are mainly in the business of broadcasting. And <span class="companylink">Disney</span>/ABC, <span class="companylink">Comcast</span>/NBC-Universal and CBS don't control significant newspaper or magazine holdings. Nor does <span class="companylink">Viacom</span>, another large company which split from CBS a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No, they don't. But part of what the film does is it kind of presents how the mainstream media operates. There's an understanding in the mainstream media that they're not going to let independent media come in and produce a major scoop – it's basically a group of organizations that act together as a cartel and they control the media together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are you suggesting the heads of these companies get together and say, “Hey, there are some really explosive stories, but for the sake of keeping the populace numb, we're not going to print them”?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think what happens in this new media monopoly is that it's a very sophisticated type of propaganda, and they've been in business for so long that there's also been some kind of a self-censorship. There's a kind of knowledge within the mainstream media that you're not going to write about certain kinds of stories that go after power or corporations they're working for, because that's just not done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York Times has published deep investigations into what they call the iEconomy, about labour conditions at factories where Apple products are put together; they've looked at <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span>'s bribery of Mexican officials. Last year the Associated Press won a Pulitzer Prize for its investigation into the <span class="companylink">NYPD</span>'s clandestine spying program that monitored Muslims. These are all stories that speak truth to power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is some very good journalism out there in the mainstream, but that's not 100 per cent of the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's look at who owns the media, look at some of their business interests, and you may see that maybe actually news is not at the head of their agenda. Their No. 1 priority is profit, and that's why we're questioning the model of the mainstream media and why we should look toward independent media that's getting very, very good these days, and we have to support it, especially on the Internet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking of the Internet, it seems to me the film largely ignores a lot of the alternative media that's cropped up on the Internet in the past few years, which provides a growing balance to the large media you criticize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't think I ignored the opportunities of the Internet. First of all, the film clearly explains media history in the U.S.: how it came about, how it came to be monopolized by five major corporations. The reason we think the history of the media is so important to present is because we're at such a crucial time now with the Internet, we're at the infancy of the Internet. It was the same thing with radio, television, when broadcast was introduced to the population: They thought, this is going to be a learning tool, it's going to be a democratic tool – and look, it's turned into an entertainment box. And we don't want the same thing to happen to the Internet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vast majority of people seem to prefer entertainment over education. Do you believe members of the public hold some responsibility for the choices they make?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think what we have to understand is that there's so much effort, so much media, so much publicity that's put toward these stupefying shows – whether it's To Catch a Predator or these so-called entertainment programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think if you ask people anywhere in the U.S. and Canada, anywhere in the world, what they would like to read, or what they would like to see on television, and you give them a choice and explain to them: This is what you get if you watch To Catch a Predator, or this is what you get if you watch a debate about an FCC hearing, I'd bet you most people would actually choose to watch a debate that concerns their family, their pocketbook and their communities.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Bryan Murray showed up all in black.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Black shirt, black pants, black shoes, black mood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How could he not be in a black mood, as general manager in a shrunken season that has already turned into an annus horribilis for his <span class="companylink">Ottawa Senators</span>?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hearts and hopes were broken only the evening before in Pittsburgh, when the skate of notorious NHL bad guy Matt Cooke came down hard on the back of Erik Karlsson's left foot, slicing into the Achilles tendon and ending what had begun as a magnificent season for the league's top defenceman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Murray came to Scotiabank Place to announce that surgery had been performed Thursday morning in Ottawa. The tendon had been 70-per-cent severed, but surgery had gone well and a full recovery is expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, as Murray said of the young star: “His year is finished at this time.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year the now 22-year-old Swede had been the surprise of the league, emerging as an offensive force rarely seen as he scored 78 points and captured the Norris Trophy as the NHL's top defenceman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, with a team-leading six goals, Karlsson had been talked about for the past week or so as perhaps the NHL's best player – a debate now rendered moot until at least next season, assuming the promised “100-per-cent recovery” comes about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Losing such a player would rattle any team, but for the Senators it is devastating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They had already lost their top stay-at-home defenceman when Jared Cowen blew out his knee while playing in the minors during the lockout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They then lost top forward and key playmaker Jason Spezza when, five games into the season, he was forced to quit and undergo back surgery for a herniated disc. Top-six forwards Peter Regin and Milan Michalek are out with injuries. Guillaume Latendresse, the big forward signed over the summer by Murray, is out with an injury. And top prospects with the minor-league Binghamton Senators, Mark Stone and Mike Hoffman, are both injured.That's eight players, several of them critical to any success the team might have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I got fired in Washington when we had seven players out,” Murray said, referring to his dismissal as the Capitals' coach during the 1989-90 season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Spezza went down, Murray said the “back end” would have to contribute, and the defence, led by Karlsson, has done just that. Now, however, the only answer is a tongue-in-cheek “We just won't allow any goals” and pray the depleted team can score a few “by committee.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What this means to fans is not hopeful. Without their top playmaker and their top player, Senators coach Paul MacLean will be forced to resort to what all NHL coaches turn to when they have little more than good goaltending: a shut-down, trapping style of play that suffocates opposition and puts viewers to sleep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If goaltender Craig Anderson – NHL player of the month in January and widely considered the top goaltender in the league at the moment – takes a turn for the worse or, gulp, suffers his own injury, it could get even uglier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does Murray still think his team, which squeaked into the playoffs last year, can make it to postseason play?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I wouldn't be here if I didn't believe that,” he said. But, of course, what else can he say?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Murray also guarded his mouth when discussing the injury and the NHL's decision not to do anything to Cooke. Cooke's rap sheet is filled with convictions for head shots and knee take-outs, though he supposedly reformed last year and stayed clear of the disciplinary office of NHL vice-president Brendan Shanahan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I feel terrible about it,” Cooke told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, “I'm not trying to do that, obviously.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The league obviously agreed. Murray spoke with Shanahan in the morning to get the league view that it was nothing more than “a hockey play gone bad.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Murray did not agree. “I don't see that,” he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it was purely accidental, as many will argue, it was a fluke in another way as well. Had the play been blown down, as it should have been, after the puck flew up and bounced off the netting, there would have been no crush along the boards, no attempt by Cooke to pin Karlsson in an inconsequential play and, of course, no slicing of the Achilles tendon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Murray denied that he was outraged that Cooke had been excused on the incident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We get no benefit of a player being suspended,” he said with a shrug. “I'm outraged that we lost Erik Karlsson, that's all.”</p>

It's welcome, because the United States has the economic clout to shift thinking on a critical global issue. But it's also worrisome, because the U.S. may not use the same muscle on its other major trading partner and the world's biggest polluter, China, and may lack the political will to clean up its own house first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ambassador, David Jacobson, did not explicitly say that the Keystone XL pipeline would not be approved by the White House unless Ottawa announces new limits on greenhouse gas emissions, or does more to protect waterways in the oil sands. But the implicit threat was there.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many, environmentalists in Canada especially, this is a happy development. Ottawa, under Prime Minister Stephen Harper, has become a climate-change outlier, lagging far behind other wealthy nations in the efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions. But it remains galling that the U.S. would implicitly threaten Canada with a severe economic sanction if it doesn't show support for President Barack Obama's agenda. Failing to approve the Keystone pipeline would do real damage to Canada's economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will the White House use similar threats against China, the world's single biggest producer of greenhouse gases? China produces nearly 20 times the greenhouse gas emissions that Canada does.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what of the United States itself, the world's second largest producer of greenhouse gases? Mr. Obama made no mention of coal in his State of the Union address. The U.S. relies on coal for as much as 35 per cent of its energy, in spite of coal being a major contributor to greenhouse gases. Coal, however, is a political hot button in the U.S. and part of a domestic energy boom that also includes shale gas and oil extraction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Far easier, then, for the President to target Canada's oil sands than the coal of West Virginia or the shale gas of Texas. It feels as if Canada has been singled out as a convenient example of Mr. Obama's new determination on climate change. But the potential damage to Canada is out of proportion with a message that verges on double-talk.</p>

Not your average proposal …” It was so unexpected that @shannmulligan “didn't know how to bring up the card.” She tweeted, “We made a nice dinner together for the first half hour after he got home,” before she finally told him she'd opened it, and said yes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When @tessanorton was single and working on a cultural studies MA, her professor took her and her fellow graduate students on what she described in a tweet as a “vulgarity-themed walking tour of London.” She wrote that that Valentine's was “entirely romanceless but super” and says it was the “best in its way, yet wouldn't trade the four normal romantic dinners I've had since then to do it again.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mittelstand. It's a German word for a mid-sized business.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany has lots of them, firms manufacturing products that get exported all over the world. These firms create domestic jobs, generate big exports, anchor communities. They are the spine of the German economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These companies exist in Canada, too, but there are fewer of them, even relative to the size of the economies of Canada and Germany. Their number in Canada is shrinking. Their disappearance is part of the ongoing drama of manufacturing across the Canadian economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2000, Canada had the world's ninth-biggest manufacturing economy; in 2010, it was ranked 15th. Manufacturing tends to produce high-paying jobs, innovation and even some research. Hollow out manufacturing and the economy suffers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hollowing has been pronounced in recent years in the mid-sized business sector. An intriguing report from the <span class="companylink">Business Development Bank of Canada</span> (BDC) tried to figure out how mid-sized business – defined as firms with 100 to 499 employees – were doing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 2006 to 2010, the BDC found, “the number of Canadian mid-sized firms decreased by 17 per cent (from 9,370 to 7,814).” Manufacturing suffered the biggest losses: From 2001 to 2010, more than half of the mid-sized manufacturing firms disappeared (the number falling from 2,807 to 1,381).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe they disappeared because they got bigger? No such luck. Only 1.4 per cent grew to become firms with more than 500 employees, whereas 14 per cent went from mid-sized to having fewer than 100 employees. Not surprisingly, Ontario suffered the most from the downdraft of mid-sized manufacturing firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is all this happening? The BDC offers three plausible reasons: the parity of the Canadian dollar with the U.S. greenback, competition from China (and other places) and the brutal recession of 2008-2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other reasons could be added: spotty innovation and research, inadequate access to financing for growth, an uneven record of searching for foreign (read: non-U.S.) markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all mid-sized firms disappeared or shrank. While many manufacturing ones did, the number of mid-sized retail firms increased, as did the number of firms in accommodation and food services and some dealing in business services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing accounts for 13 per cent of Canada's economic output, so that sector alone can hardly be blamed for the dispiriting trade deficit Canada has experienced since the end of 2008. In 2012, Canada enjoyed a big trade surplus with the United States but a deficit with the rest of the world. Remove $58-billion in energy exports from the calculation and our merchandise deficit would look awful. Canada remains, overall, a hewer of wood and drawer of water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports have been tumbling in to the Conservative government about how to stimulate innovation and research and how to use government purchasing to help Canadian firms develop. The latest, from a committee chaired by Tom Jenkins of Canadian software company Open Text, suggests that the government identify six industrial sectors with relevance to the defence industry and steer contracts to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This made-in-Canada approach is appealing in theory. It could work just as the committee suggests. It could also follow an old, ingrained Canadian tradition whereby defence contracts are awarded to satisfy regional political imperatives. Buying foreign is sometimes cheaper and better, although buying foreign is always more politically charged. Buying domestic as a matter of course can sometimes mean higher prices and long delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Harper government has just established a venture capital fund. It has changed the tax incentive regime for innovation. Governments will offer various kinds of subsidies to locate plants here and there. A dictionary of government support programs and tax expenditures exists to help businesses, including manufacturing firms. And no one should forget the subsidies and bailouts lavished on the auto and aerospace industries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing industries can produce at a second's notice a shopping list of other policies they want from government. Remember, though, that governments have been trying to help for a long time, at some political risk, by introducing such measures as the Goods and Services Tax and in some provinces blending the GST with the provincial sales tax to make the HST.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All these measures don't seem to have arrested the decline of mid-sized manufacturing enterprises.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now we know what the ‘M' stands for. We learned this in Skyfall, the crowd-pleasing James Bond movie released last fall and just arriving on DVD and Blu-ray.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Bond is not James Bond because he's James Bond. He's James Bond because he's an only child who lost his parents as a boy and lived life ever since trying to please his lost mommy. If Judi Dench's M had learned this before being holed up at the Bond family estate in Scotland – where she was taken by Daniel Craig's Bond for protection from a different prodigal surrogate son – things might have turned out differently. She might have realized she's got a little boy lost for a super-agent and promptly issued him a nanny.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do we really need to know how fundamentally lonely and unhappy James Bond is? Isn't that kind of like learning Batman is Batman because he's really an orphan with lurching bat-phobia, or Luke Skywalker is Luke Skywalker because Darth Vader's really his dad?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But wait a sec, we loved that stuff too, so the question is why? What appeals to us about learning there's something basically squishy and sweet under the hard crust of our pop heroes' make-my-day surface? If we learn to love these guys (and, increasingly, girls too) because they're tough, why do we also want to know they go home at night, lie on their big lonely beds – sometimes following a spiritually empty toss or two with an anonymous hottie – and really wish they were just like us?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's it, of course. It's the ultimate in vicariously satisfying pop cultural payback fantasy: Deep down, what James Bond really wants is the reverse of what we've always wanted – which is to be just like him. Truly, what can be a more flattering idea to leave the movie theatre with than James Bond wishing he, too, could be heading home in a mildly dented SUV to walk the dog in the rain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skyfall fell at a fascinating moment in the history of the pop spy hero, when real-world espionage operations were at once never more real yet never less romantic or glamourous. If we'd learned anything since the end of the Cold War and the rise of fundamentalist terrorism, it's that secret state ops are everywhere and more entrenched than ever. Which, among other things, suggests that John le Carré (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy), and not Bond-creator Ian Fleming, was the true fictional prophet as far as spy storytelling went. It really is a dull and nasty bureaucratic business, best practised by those who know how to bury their emotions even more deeply than their cover. By the middle of the first decade of this century, it was far easier (if markedly less fun) to imagine le Carré's sublimely bland George Smiley thriving at the spook game than James Bond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the fact is we need the fun. So our movie spies have to meet us somewhere in between the big screen and the small stuff of real living, and that's precisely where Skyfall, and a number of other contemporary pop spy sagas, fall. Skyfall was a big, testosterone-primed junk-food fantasy with feelings. It might give us Bond with all the fury, fun and fashion we pay for, but it also gives us a Bond who's sorely deprived of breastfeeding. (There you go, doc: another conspicuous fixation accounted for.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider what other so-called “secret” agents are up to – and there's a lot of them, especially if you include movies about the activities of shadowy state organizations like the <span class="companylink">CIA</span>. Spy movies appear to be re-claiming a popular generic currency not seen since the Cold War peak of the mid-1960s. If the new enemies of the state were stateless entities cloaked in secrecy, survival depended on response in kind: a phantom war fought out in the open. We were compelled to accept that everything once hidden was now hidden in plain sight. Or, as Ralph Fiennes' M-ascendant puts it in Skyfall, “There aren't any shadows left.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which leaves us not only with a world more nakedly embroiled in the business of treachery, espionage, deception and sinister euphemising (“enhanced interrogation techniques”), but even more aware of the little hearts whose beating drives the big machine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so the spies are crying. We've got Bond mournfully crouched in a reverse Piéta at the close of Skyfall; spy mom Naomi Watts is coldly outed as a <span class="companylink">CIA</span> op in Fair Game; Jeremy Renner runs not only for his life but for his defiled humanity in The Bourne Legacy; Ben Affleck's “exfiltrator” is restored to bedtime-story daddyhood at the end of Argo; and even Maya (Jessica Chastain) – perhaps the most monomaniacally single-tracked and severely unattached of all contemporary movie secret state operators – in the final shot of Zero Dark Thirty sits alone in a huge military transport aircraft, strapped like luggage to a wall, a tear staining her perfect porcelain cheek.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She may have almost single-handedly rid the world of Osama bin Laden, its most wanted bad guy, but in the end there's still something missing, something deep and fundamental unfulfilled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One is left wondering if that plane won't be dropping her at mom and dad's.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will Canada's negotiations with Europe be left behind unless Ottawa makes some dramatic concessions in its own negotiations with the EU, as some suggest? It's doubtful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barack Obama does not seem serious about free trade. There is little to indicate that he has a real interest in concluding trade deals, let alone with the EU.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal announced with the EU is the first of Mr. Obama's presidency. During this time, the Office of the United States Trade Representative has been focused on the enforcement of existing agreements, not the negotiation of new deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if we assume the President is sincere in his desire to conclude a deal with the EU, provisions that will ensure U.S. states open their public procurement markets to European firms – the No. 1 priority for the EU in the current Canada-EU Comprehensive and Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) – will be required. European negotiators are likely to demand concessions in automotive and agricultural subsidies and trade that will be difficult for the President to swallow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should the President make these hard decisions, will Congress approve such a deal – especially given that the President does not have fast-track negotiating authority (the ability to send trade agreements to Congress for approval or rejection without amendments or filibustering)?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highly unlikely. A <span class="companylink">U.S. Congress</span> that is unable to negotiate a lifting of the debt ceiling seems unlikely to agree on the most wide-reaching bilateral free-trade agreement in history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Europeans must surely be aware of this, but they are also keenly aware that the scale of their relationship with the United States demands an updated architecture that will allow the two to set the terms of trade in light of the failure of the WTO process and the rise of China. They are right to want to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The EU will be in a far stronger negotiating position with the Americans with the CETA in hand. They will have a template for many of the things that they intend to ask for in their negotiations with the United States, and U.S. exporters will complain that they are at a competitive disadvantage to their Canadian counterparts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A U.S.-EU agreement will be good for Canada, as it can help clean up the outstanding rules of origin that are used to determine whether a product qualifies for export status in a free-trade agreement – notably for autos, textiles and food products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These goods are produced in the highly integrated NAFTA marketplace, making it difficult to assign a level of Canadian content required to meet the rules of origin thresholds demanded of the Europeans in the CETA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a U.S.-EU free-trade agreement in place, the EU could be pressured to accept the rules of origin for these same goods with a NAFTA designation. Canada will be in a strong position to negotiate given that the EU would then have free-trade agreements with all three members of NAFTA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the good news is that the deal that so many said would never be announced has been announced and, when completed, will be positive for Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bad news is that we should expect to wait a long time for it to be signed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe is currently dealing with what is arguably one of the most embarrassing food safety incidents in history. The discovery of horsemeat in burgers – the first one was found in Ireland in early January through DNA testing – has turned into a full-blown, industry-wide investigation. Officials have revealed that lasagna labelled as beef from one big retailer of frozen foods, Findus, actually contained horsemeat; in some cases, the meat content was 100-per-cent horse.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fraud investigators have been attempting to track down the origin of the meat. Government officials have been meeting with food retailers and have assured consumers that there is nothing inherently unsafe about eating horsemeat. Yet the malaise brought about by the scandal persists. Consumers are annoyed, and rightly so. Canadians should take note: Such an incident could happen in our country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many food businesses in Canada have traceability systems. But most of these systems are not interconnected, which makes data sharing between supply chain partners inefficient. Tracing food products and ingredients, both upstream and downstream, is almost impossible. Under our current traceability regime, it is possible to sell a food product with unidentified ingredients. It would be difficult for food retailers to know they were doing so unless they tested every single product they receive from suppliers. The costs would be prohibitive and passed on to consumers. This is not a desirable scenario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technology for a highly functional food traceability system exists, but the business case to support it has yet to be made. Survey after survey presents evidence that Canadians expect food safety but are unwilling to pay for it. Furthermore, Canada is a vast, sparsely populated country, which makes logistics complicated. Food traceability systems rely on sound logistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some wonder whether the European horsemeat scandal was overblown. After all, horsemeat is a delicacy in many countries. It is high in iron. It is also tender, which is why it is a preferred meat for rare steaks or tartare. But the labelling of horsemeat as beef has breached one of the great gastronomic taboos of Britain, a country that prides itself on its love of certain animals, particularly horses. It can be argued that the same goes for English Canada. From a food safety standpoint, substances contained in horsemeat could be harmful to humans. Even worse, the implications for food products marked kosher or halal could be devastating. Traceability is essential for food systems in an increasingly fragmented marketplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the United Kingdom was hit with its mad cow disease crisis in 1996, Canada did not appreciate how complex the situation was until we were hit with our own crisis in 2003. Billions of dollars later, we got it. The powers of food safety can never be underestimated, and food traceability can help us better manage risks across supply chains. We should not miss another opportunity to learn from the mistakes of our friends across the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we are to enhance our food traceability systems, we need to do it right. Economics should trump politics. We also need to do it for the right reasons. The food industry needs to play a larger role in being accountable, both to itself and to consumers. Governments do not have the resources to offset consumer fears. More sustainable solutions, driven by the industry, are required in food safety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many industry CEOs around the world acknowledge that the one thing that can destroy their companies literally overnight is a food safety incident of some sort. We have already experienced a few crises. We should try to avoid another.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some worrisome new research this week found that Canadians over 65 increased their debt levels by 15 per cent last year, even as all other age groups finally put the brakes on borrowing. While seniors still remain the least indebted group on average, there is growing evidence that, as baby boomers move into retirement, they are bringing with them very different savings and spending habits from those of the generation before them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the spending side, new Ipsos Reid data analyzed by <span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion Bank</span> shows overall Canadian household debt grew last year at its slowest pace since 2003. Quite a lot of non-mortgage debt – such as credit cards and lines of credit – was repaid last year, which is good news because it tends to be more expensive and more risky than mortgage debt. The worry, however, was that those over 65 saw their debt grow 15 per cent, or about $6,000 per household; “Canadians are entering retirement more indebted than ever,” said the TD chief economist Craig Alexander.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These data dovetail with new savings research released this week by Statistics Canada, which reported that just 24 per cent of tax filers in 2011 made a contribution to a Registered Retirement Savings Plan, continuing a long decline in RRSP participation from 29 per cent a decade ago. While some of the decline may be due to a savings shift into new Tax Free Savings Accounts, the downward trend in RRSP participation rates began well before the introduction of TFSAs in 2009 and continued during stronger economic times in the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trends suggest that many today are destined to have less comfortable retirements than the generation that came before them. And while some of the blame for that outcome goes to forces outside individual control – including a decline in workplace pension plans and higher housing costs that reduce scope for saving – baby boomers heading closer to retirement need to realize that some of them are saving less and borrowing more because they choose lifestyles they cannot truly afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxpayers who are not going to make a RRSP contribution this year should stop to ponder whether they really cannot afford to save. If they have simply chosen not to save, they must be realistic and recognize the kind of retirement they will have to face.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to Oscar season, the old “it's just a movie” dodge doesn't apply. Part of the Academy Awards ritual is that best-picture contenders, enjoying their six weeks in the media limelight, are scrutinized not only for what they include but what they leave out on issues of racism, historical accuracy and political ideology.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the boutique studios like Miramax and DreamWorks were flexing their muscles in the late nineties, there was a rash of Oscar smear campaigns, designed to plant doubts about such Oscar favourites as A Beautiful Mind (when casting your vote, consider – was A Beautiful Mind's John Nash an anti-Semite?), Saving Private Ryan and The Pianist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, the negativity began to reflect badly on the Oscars and in 2004, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences outlawed negative campaigns. In practice, the rule has just made the campaigns more stealthy. In 2009, stories popped up about Slumdog Millionaire's impoverished child stars; in 2011, headlines appeared about The King's Speech hero, George VI, and his alleged Nazi-sympathizing past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, only the ecumenical fable Life of Pi, based on Yann Martel's novel, has completely escaped political censure, although most of the others have got off lightly. Les Misérables, a story now well-distanced from its rousing 19th-century radicalism, has failed to spark the ready rage of Tea Partiers or Fox News pundits. Even Austrian director Michael Haneke's Amour, dealing with disability and death, has been largely exempt from controversy, in contrast to the outrage foisted on Million Dollar Baby in 2005. And although a few critics have accused this year's Silver Linings Playbook of treating mental illness as a cute quirk, many more have praised it for highlighting the issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quentin Tarantino's slave revenge fantasy, Django Unchained, is supposed to be controversial for its cartoon violence and use of the N-word but, in reality, the film has drawn little enemy fire, beyond Spike Lee's tweet that he wouldn't see a film that disrespected black history. By now, Tarantino's knowing political incorrectness seems to have earned him a free pass, especially since his movie is not a serious best-picture contender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beasts of the Southern Wild, a fable of resistance from the perspective of a child, hasn't been quite as lucky, despite rave reviews and endorsements from Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">African-American poet-activist bell hooks has denounced it as racist fantasy which celebrates the “pornography of violence.” But this low-budget, no-star, first-time feature is already such an outlier success that no criticism can really hurt it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps most of this year's critical oxygen has been burned off in the firestorm around Zero Dark Thirty, Kathryn Bigelow's thriller about the hunt for Osama bin Laden. But accounts of an anti-Bigelow “smear campaign” are absurd. In the midst of the fierce ongoing debate about the morality and legality of the United States's anti-terrorism tactics, no studio publicist needed to push the film's detractors, including New Yorker writer Jane Mayer or documentarian Alex Gibney, to challenge Bigelow's portrayal of the <span class="companylink">CIA</span>'s practices. Doubters were unlikely to be mollified by Bigelow's flag-waving response in the L.A. Times – that the film was a portrait of “ordinary Americans who fought bravely even as they sometimes [her italics] crossed moral lines, who laboured greatly and intently, who gave all of themselves in both victory and defeat, in life and in death, for the defence of this nation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oscar-season criticisms may have derailed Zero Dark Thirty's Oscar chances but they've only slightly tarnished Lincoln's halo, along with screenwriter Tony Kushner's claim that the film was “inordinately accurate.” The complaints have ranged from trivial (Daniel Day-Lewis's pierced ears) to sins of omission and distortion, played out in The New York Times. African-American studies historian Kate Masur struck a chord in an opinion piece when she said the movie “perpetuates the notion that African-Americans have offered little of substance to their own liberation.” Pulitzer Prize-winning historian and Lincoln scholar Eric Foner, in a letter to the Times, said the film “grossly exaggerates the possibility that by January, 1865, the war might have ended with slavery still intact.” In an interview on CNN, Foner added this useful advice: “I recommend that people see it – and then read a book about Lincoln.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Argo, currently considered the best-picture favourite, has its issues. Most people know the film contrived the depiction of the suspenseful escape from the Tehran airport in 1980. Some critics, including the CBC's Jian Ghomeshi in a Globe and Mail article, have called the film racist for its portrayal of Iranians, while others have faulted it for failing to cast a Latino actor, instead of Affleck, as CIA agent Tony Mendez.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet overall, Argo is enjoying an unusual amount of dramatic licence. Iran is still regarded as the No. 1 choice for the next U.S. invasion, and Mendez, who has a movie-tie-in book, hasn't complained about the casting. As for Argo's original postscript, which mocked the honours heaped on Canadian diplomat Ken Taylor, Affleck fixed that, while turning an espionage coup that used to be called “the Canadian Caper” into an excuse for American patriotism. As Canadians, we're used to this and diplomatically adroit enough to let some things slide.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ballem: Thank you all for being here. As you all know, when I was hired to do this job in 2008 I promised all of you, and especially you, Mr. Mayor, that within the first six years of our mandate you wouldn't be able to tell this place from Portland. Today, I'd like to update you on our progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm pleased to say that this week alone we have made some major strides toward our goal with the approval of “food cart clusters” or, as Councillor Deal likes to refer to them, “cluster-trucks,” and with an unbelievably complicated policy report on arts and culture events in small spaces. Does anyone even understand that thing? Show of hands? Anyone? I didn't think so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both of those items build on the good work we have done to date, but we need to do more and we need to do it faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is why today I'd like to tell you about the third and final phase of The Portland Plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We already have greenways and bike lanes, car share programs, and Farmers Markets all over the city. We have a young, hip, urban counterculture, and a growing craft-beer industry. And goodness knows we have the mary jane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we need to take this to the next level. This is, needless to say, confidential. So far we've managed to move ahead with the plan without anyone really noticing. I'm hoping to keep it that way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So here we go. No. 1: Start offering incentives for more dog-friendly businesses like doggie delis, dog-walking services and doggie spas, and increase the number of dog parks. We know how people love their dogs in this city. Let's make Vancouver even more dog-crazy than Portland. Councillor Stevenson, sorry guy, this one is yours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. 2: Offer some tax relief for independent bookstores, secondhand clothing stores and pottery studios. The amount of the rebate will depend on where they set up shop. As well, let's amend the zoning to make sure there is nothing stopping anybody who wants to open a brewery from getting started. Councillor Tang, I'm giving this one to you. It's time we get your face out there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. 3: Buy some product placement for the city on a popular TV show. If they're drinking <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> coffee on Homeland, and talking about Oregon wines on Hawaii Five-O, how hard can it be to get Lena Dunham to mention Wreck Beach in an episode of Girls? Councillor Ball, you take that one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. 4: Laneway houses, garage houses. I know we've been doing well there, but what we've got so far looks pretty neat and tidy and architectural. Let's see if we can't encourage some real off-the-grid hippy stuff when it comes to design. Like hire a couple of boatbuilders or something to do some demo projects. Think vertical gardens and geothermal heat and lots of curved wood. Yes, Councillor Reimer, I'm looking at you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. 5: Reduce the speed limits in residential areas and adjust the timing of the traffic lights so people can't just drive anywhere. I'll talk to engineering about that one. Oh, and get rid of the viaducts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. 6: Let's pack those food trucks into every vacant parking space along every business strip in the city. I'm talking about Broadway, Main Street, Dunbar, 4th Avenue, Commercial. Yeah I know, restaurant owners will complain. Tough. These things are PR gold. Every time we announce two more are opening up it's a major new event in this city. Councillor Deal, needless to say…</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are in the home stretch here. My commitment to you is that I will not rest until we can give the people of this city a bike-centric vegan food cart festival with a child-friendly craft beer garden and all-ages dance tent that this city can be truly proud of.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question We are travelling to Singapore in late March. Do you have any advice?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From landmark museums to handsome colonial architecture and from clamorous neighbourhoods to action-packed theme parks, city-state Singapore is one of Asia's most accessible destinations for English speakers. It's also home to a top-table hawker food scene, so make sure you pack those pants with the elasticized waist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since I've only visited once – quick tip: don't bother with the $30 Singapore Slings at the Raffles Hotel – I tapped some local experts for recommendations on where to go (and what to eat).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Travel blogger Rosemarie John (travelandbeyond.org) has three must-see suggestions. “The <span class="companylink">Asian Civilisations Museum</span> is great if you're interested in the region's history, from Singapore's ancestral cultures to artifacts spanning the entire Asian continent,” she says, adding that the 1837-built St. Andrews Cathedral – based on a 13th-century English abbey – is also perfect for architecture fans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(I'd also include Gardens by the Bay, a spectacular botanical attraction of waterfront plant pavilions, climate-controlled glasshouses and “supertrees,” a clutch of man-made, tree-shaped towers covered in flowers that perform a dazzling nighttime light show.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The giant new Marine Life Park S.E.A Aquarium completes her top three. Opened in November 2012, it's part of Resorts World Sentosa, a popular monorail-accessed pleasure isle of casinos, a Universal Studios theme park and soft-eco activities such as beach Segway tours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alternatively, John suggests Pulau Ubin island, a 15-minute “bumboat” ride from Changi Point Ferry Terminal. Ideal for nature walks and bike rides, you can hire wheels at the dock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John also suggests Chinatown for self-directed walking tours. “Apart from the vivid colours and fanciful trinkets, it's home to Singapore's oldest Hindu temple – the Sri Mariamman Temple – plus the Jamae Mosque and the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple.” The rainbow-hued Sri Mariamman is well-worth charging your camera batteries for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with Little India, Chinatown is perfect for budget shopping, while Orchard Road's 22 malls will sate your designer retail impulses. In common with most Singapore hotspots, all three are accessible by the handy Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system – reloadable Ez-Link passes are available from all stations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all that exploring leaves you week with hunger, food blogger Catherine Ling (www.camemberu.com[http://www.camemberu.com]) suggests filling up at Singapore's hawker centres – food courts crammed with often unfamiliar but ever-tempting dishes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Be open to trying all kinds of food,” she says. “This is a melting pot of many cultures, and the resulting cuisine can be fairly different, even if the original dish started in another country. And don't be afraid to ask locals about food: eating is our passion, our number one pastime and probably the national sport.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ling recommends three centres for first-timers. “Old Airport Road Food Centre has everything from freshly made cheong fun [steamed rice rolls] to barbecued seafood. It's famous for Hokkien mee, wanton mee, and char kway teow – wok-fried rice noodles. Brave first timers can also try kway chap, or braised pig innards with rice sheet noodles.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The old-school Maxwell Food Centre is recommended for classics such as chicken rice, fish congee, prawn fritters and deep-fried sweet potato dumplings, while Tekka Market is “a hub of Indian, Muslim and Chinese stalls with excellent nasi briyani, murtabak, Masala tea, Chinese duck rice and Teochew glutinous rice cakes.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Navigating the markets can be initially intimidating, but after a couple of orders you'll be flying. “Most hawkers understand basic English,” Ling says. “But don't be put off of they appear brusque. All they expect is for you to tell them your order, quantity and whether it's tar pao [takeaway] or ‘eating here.' ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While hawker nosh will fill your belly, sometimes a romantic restaurant dinner is required. Ling's top picks are Chinese seafood – including local favourite chili crab – at the Majestic Bay Seafood Restaurant at Gardens by the Bay; French fusion dishes at the view-tastic Sky on 57 atop the 57-storey Marina Bay Sands hotel (there's also a ticketed viewing platform here if you want to enjoy the vistas without splurging on dinner or a hotel stay); and exquisite nouvelle cuisine at Andre.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once, when on vacation in Rome, I found myself scavenging for baby food in a grocery store. There were rows of familiar bottles – mush of spinach, chicken, pasta – and then an entire section of tiny jars featuring a picture of a beautiful palomino horse. Pureed horsemeat baby food. I felt my stomach heave, and the baby did not eat cavallo that night – or any night afterward.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why the squeamishness? On that trip, I ate the flesh of pigs – both wild and domestic – lambs, cows and fish. At other times, I've eaten kangaroo, crocodile and guinea pig. (Should you ever find yourself contemplating a roasted guinea pig, consider eating your own foot instead – it would be tastier.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I love horses. I rode when I was younger and have spent far too much of my adult life at racetracks. But I quite like pigs, too, yet nothing will come between me and a BLT. Why not horse? It's lean, healthy and by most accounts quite delicious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Britain is in the grip of a full-blown horsemeat panic. Some of the prepared meals and burgers sold in its grocery stores have been fraudulently labelled as beef and are in fact horsemeat. It's a complicated deception involving nefarious meat traders and clueless processing plants, all hinging on supermarket chains' demand for ever-cheaper food (almost all the bogus meat was in “value meals”). Horse meat has also been found in school and hospital meals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disgust and black humour, a particularly British cocktail, immediately followed the outbreak of the scandal. “All who ate horseburger are in stable condition” was one of the jokes galloping around <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>. Traces of a horse painkiller known to be harmful to humans have been found in some of the meat. British Prime Minister David Cameron has promised to prosecute the fraudulent horse traders. “If there has been criminal activity, there should be the full intervention of the law,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wave of revulsion that followed the deception is in one way understandable – nobody wants to have the mane pulled over their eyes – but, in another, baffling. Being a vegetarian is a completely worthy moral choice, but if you've gone the way of the flesh, why value one meat and shun another?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is completely irrational,” says Pierre Desrochers, who teaches food-policy courses at the University of Toronto, when I phone to ask him about the origins of culinary taboos. Prof. Desrochers grew up eating horse in Quebec, and it was quite nice. “What's the difference between a horse and a goat?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the differences, of course, is that no one ever rode a goat into battle. The sanctity of the horse is ingrained in some cultures, Prof. Desrochers says, because of its magnificence and nobility and usefulness. Vikings, not known for their picky appetites, refused to eat horses. And starving Gauls, besieged by Julius Caesar, let theirs escape rather than slaughtering them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The descendants of the Gauls threw off that prejudice, and by the mid-19th century, horse was popular in France, the soup made of its bones considered un bouillon supérieur to beef broth. It's been suggested that one of the reasons the British are so repulsed by horse is that it's such a very French thing to eat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The British diner, historically, has not been among the world's most adventurous. “He wants none of your foreign kickshaws, frogs, and snails in fricassees, or sea slug, or bird's nest soup, or horse flesh steak,” wrote Peter Lund Simmonds in The Curiosities of Food, published in 1859, one of the earliest surveys of international carnivorism (young porcupine is quite delicious, apparently, as is camel tongue, properly prepared). Even then, the British were horrified by the prospect of serving Black Beauty in pies. English Canada has traditionally shared that loathing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interestingly, the recent scandal is probably not the first time the British have probably been duped into eating horse. As Mr. Simmonds wrote more than 150 years ago, “There is very little doubt that horse-flesh, besides its application for ‘cats' meat,' enters, even now, largely into surreptitious use in certain quarters in this country as food for bipeds.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Culture is fluid, and taboos change over time. One man's horse or cow or embryonic duck egg delicacy is another man's invitation to vomit. The horsemeat scandal erupted just as the Catholic world was preparing for Lent and the carnivals that accompany it (from carne vale – “farewell to the flesh”). Maybe it's a cosmic hint about admiring our animal friends – and not eating them. Or, more likely, it's an earthly hint that something's out of whack when the cash-strapped have to resort to mystery meat to make ends meet.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aristocracy might be our theme for the weekend, which is dominated by the end of this season of Downton Abbey and by Beyoncé Knowles. Lady Mary – or the most famous and fabulously successful singer of our time? What's our poison? And is it really aristocracy coming our way, or the fabulous allure of banality?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life Is But A Dream (Saturday, HBO Canada, 9 p.m.) is an astonishing documentary, especially if you come at it merely curious about Beyoncé – not a fan, not a devotee of the music, but mildly interested in this very famous person. It's astonishing because it's very much a concoction of our age: simultaneously revealing and bleakly contrived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Made (of course) under Beyoncé's auspices, the show deals a lot with her decision a couple years back to stop having her father, Matthew Knowles, manage her. Talking in a curious language – a mixture of therapy talk and music-biz executive-speak – she goes on and on about needing her father's approval since childhood, and how that helped and then restricted her. There are odd scenes, early on, of her father coming and going in her professional life, usually while the singer is talking about what seem very private mental conflicts. At times, it's downright creepy to witness this adult woman's musings about her dad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is her work ethic, which seems mind-boggling: the obsession with the music, the choreography, and the construction of her oeuvre; the analysis of how her audience perceives her; and her lament that occasional hit songs strike a deep chord with people, while carefully crafted albums don't command respect. It is a bewildering experience to hear her talk so passionately about music that is, most of the time, phenomenally banal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Beyoncé is known to be fairly private, the material about her relationship with Jay-Z, her pregnancy and her devotion to daughter Blue Ivy will make the program fascinating to some people. But to the casual observer of pop music, what is taken away is the relentless work, and the devotion to commercial success – and, perhaps, the uneasy feeling that the viewer is being used as part of an elaborate strategy to open up new markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downton Abbey (Sunday, PBS, 9 p.m. on Masterpiece Classic) reaches the end of its third season, one that had a lot more action than did the second. The series is now beyond reviewing: It has a status that makes criticism redundant; it's more a matter of fans savouring this and that character or scene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been so much packed into a short batch of episodes. So many twists, so many upswings of emotion. But at this season's heart, one could say, has been the relationship between Matthew and Mary. While other events have unfolded, the core of the series has been the pair of them, deeply in love with each other, staring deeply into each other's eyes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things change as this season ends, but Lady Mary remains the one constant, the source of allure: the tension between her and her parents, the need for her growth. In a way, this all connects to the Beyoncé story. Father. Support of a loving partner. Wealth. But there is a difference, of course, Lady Mary being so restricted in her actions by her gender and status and era.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two types of aristocratic ladies with overlapping problems. Two periods in time. The differences illustrate much about Downton – and maybe something about Beyoncé, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also airing this weekend</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2012 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony (Saturday, HBO Canada, 6:45 p.m.) airs just before the Beyoncé special and might have some music more to the taste of people bewildered by Knowles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's about last year's induction of the Beastie Boys, Donovan, Guns N' Roses, Laura Nyro, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Small Faces/the Faces, the Blue Caps, the Comets, the Crickets and the Famous Flames.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Republic of Doyle (Sunday, CBC, 9 p.m.) has taken a wise turn this season, putting emphasis on the storyline of Sgt. Leslie Bennett (Krystin Pellerin) and the dilemmas and issues that arise when she goes undercover. This week's episode has some interesting action for the Doyle clan, on the trail of an international art thief. And singer Alan Doyle, who provides the “Oh, yeah” music, makes a guest appearance.</p>

It sells digital products and services to schools, universities, big companies and governments – anyone engaged in the learning business. Its software is helping to change the way education is managed and delivered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This technology will modernize the classroom the way the computer modernized the typewriter,” says D2L's founder, John Baker, a 36-year-old entrepreneur who was trained as a systems engineer at the University of Waterloo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">D2L's technology allows instructors to treat everyone as an individual by understanding how they're doing and providing targeted help. If Susie is having trouble with fractions or not relating to her classmates, it will flag the problem. School systems are using its predictive analytics to identify at-risk students, and to boost performance, retention and graduation rates. Its software is also turning the classroom on its head. One of the hottest ideas in education is the “flipped class,” which involves moving lecture content offline so that students can read it on their computers or smart phones on their own time, and spend class time in discussion and group work. There are also lots of nifty apps. The Assignment Grader app allows a teacher to leave those stacks of paper at school and grade assignments on her mobile device, using written comments, as well as video or audio feedback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The learning industry – which has barely changed in the past 100 years – is ripe for transformation. And it's huge. “There are 100 million learners in North America alone,” Mr. Baker estimates. Several statewide college systems are now using D2L's technology, and the next big opportunity is K-12. The company has doubled in size since a year ago, and now employs 600 (mostly young) people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the idea of working for someone else doesn't appeal to barista girl, she's in luck. Thanks to the IT revolution, starting your own business is easier than ever, as American thinker Walter Russell Mead has pointed out: All you need is a computer and an Internet connection. You can provide math tutoring to kids, music instruction, even long-distance psychological counselling. You don't even have to be in the same country as your clients. You can find cheap marketing information to identify your potential customers, and you can reach them via social media. You can buy inexpensive accounting and billing software. If you have employees, you can even get HR advice online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The IT revolution is wiping out entire industries, like bookstores and travel agents. But it is also creating virtually unlimited opportunities for new service businesses. Do you hate package tours? Try Trufflepig, a custom travel agency based in Toronto that was founded by three friends with tons of travel experience. The company can custom plan a child-friendly trip to Paris for you or line up a traditional Samburu warrior to introduce you to Africa. Trufflepig now has a loyal clientele, plus a dozen employees who live in several different countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today people are happy to pay for services that used to be available only to the rich. Food preparation is a great example. Only wealthy people can afford private chefs. But almost anyone can afford a pre-cooked dinner from <span class="companylink">Loblaws</span>. If you don't want to pick up your dinner, there are a dozen ways to make dinner come to you. There are even services for people who like cooking but don't have time to shop. The latest twist, according to The New York Times, is the dinner kit. Just click and order your Maple-Glazed Salmon online, and a box will show up at your doorstep with fresh ingredients that are labelled and premeasured down to the last cilantro sprig. Recipe included. Just do what it says, and serve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entrepreneurs who can sense changes in what people want and need are always going to do well. In 2000, a couple of smart people figured out that there was a market opportunity in young urbanites who don't own a car but need one from time to time. So they started <span class="companylink">Zipcar</span>, which lets you rent a car online for a few hours at a decent price, without the hassle of a standard car rental. I know a ton of people who use <span class="companylink">Zipcar</span>. Avis bought the company last month for $500-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is scarcely the first time that a great disruption has made people gloomy about the future. As Prof. Mead notes, the 1890s were much worse. A revolution in agriculture was driving people off the land, and nobody could imagine how they or their children would make a living. People thought that when the farming jobs disappeared the economy would be finished. They were wrong then. And they're probably just as wrong now.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, what would it take to persuade you to have another baby? A big tax break? A monthly stipend? Free child care? A big house?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I wouldn't do that again for all the money in the world” is a perfectly reasonable answer. But be prepared: At some point, your government is going to pitch you on a larger family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have entered the age of the fertility panic. Country after country is discovering that smaller families are causing the population to shrink, which means more old people, and therefore higher government expenses and lower tax revenues. And many of those countries are then jumping to the wrong conclusion: that they should persuade people to have more kids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest victim is the United States, which until recently was proud of its big, corn-fed families, but discovered last year that the economic crisis and constricted immigration have pushed its average family size down to 1.9 children, below the 2.1 needed for population stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has led a number of American voices to propose what European countries have been doing for more than a decade and what Quebec has tried since the 1980s: attempting to create larger families through policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This theme has been seized upon most dramatically by the conservative author Jonathan Last, whose book What to Expect When No One's Expecting created alarming headlines across America this week. He is not satisfied to warn of rising pension and health-care costs. “Declining populations have always followed or been followed by Very Bad Things. Disease. War. Economic stagnation or collapse. And these grim tidings from history may be in our future,” his first chapter warns. (He follows this by reassuring us that unlike the population-growth scaremongers of the 1970s, “I'm not selling doom.”)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apocalypse notwithstanding, population shrinkage is indeed a difficult policy challenge. Canada, whose average family size is 1.59 children, would be confronting it if we did not take in some 300,000 immigrants per year (which is only a temporary fix, because immigrant fertility rates fall to the national average within a couple generations). Even so, projections made by the Library of Parliament show that Canada's aging population will force its public-pension costs to quadruple over the next 23 years, and health-care costs to rise from 7 per cent to as much as 12 per cent of provincial budgets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This leads countries to believe that the solution is to pay for more children – and to discover how fruitless this can be. Germany spends 200 billion euros a year, equivalent to two-thirds of its federal budget, on a web of benefits meant to encourage people to have babies. But Der Spiegel magazine has just published an internal government report, accurately billed as “an indictment of 60 years of German family policy,” which shows that a decade of this spending kept millions of women out of the labour force without raising Germany's average family size above 1.39 children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec, which has given as much as $8,000 to women for having extra children, has had similarly dire results. The only place to have pulled it off is France, and then only barely – it raised its fertility rate from just shy of 2 children per family to 2.1. What did it entail? Most famously, in 2005, France started giving $1,000 a month for a year to any mother willing to stay at home and have a third child.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That helped somewhat. It was enough money, as several French parents told me, to add an extra bedroom. But what really worked was the less glittery part of the policy: heavily subsidized daycare for all children under the age of 3, and free all-day schooling from the child's third birthday. Those policies allowed French women to have three children without completely destroying their careers and returning to the 19th century, and helped immigrants enter the labour force, creating tax revenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem in the United States is that the people who are freaking out about fertility are those who tend to oppose immigration, working mothers and state spending. Mr. Last, the American author, squares this ideological circle with proposals that include raising university tuition fees to as much as $100,000 a year as a deterrent (because “higher education dampens fertility in all sorts of ways”), building highways so people can live in big suburban houses, and encouraging more religion, because the faithful are fecund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is all a tortured way of evading the real issue: economic health, which not only makes population shrinkage more affordable, but causes people to have more babies. Working women and higher education aren't obstacles to solving the fertility problem – they're major parts of the solution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday, February 20, 2013</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Saturday column incorrectly said that projections made by the Library of Parliament show that over the next 23 years, health care costs would rise from 7 per cent to as much as 12 per cent of provincial budgets. In fact, that percentage of health care costs should have been attributed to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and not to provincial budgets.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a government-inspired, eight-month sojourn, politicians returned to the B.C. capital this week for a final round of jousting before a general election.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Normally after an absence of that length, MLAs of opposing stripes are itching to noisily proclaim their ideological distaste for one another. The fact that we're in the run-up to an election should have made the atmosphere even more fraught. And while it got noisy at times, it wasn't nearly as feisty and malicious as one might have expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of that has to do with the more respectful tone that NDP Leader Adrian Dix is trying to establish in the legislative chamber. A couple of times during Question Period, he could be seen urging his MLAs not to respond to shots being fired by Liberals across the floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was one moment when Mr. Dix showed remarkable restraint himself. It happened when colleague and former leadership challenger Mike Farnworth rose to query Premier Christy Clark on the taxpayer-funded and highly partisan advertising campaign the government has commenced. Mr. Farnworth is one of the NDP's best Question Period performers, one whose voice can thunder with indignation when calling out the government. After he asked a question to loud applause from his colleagues, a scrappy Ms. Clark yelled out from across the aisle: “That's why you would have been a better leader, Mike.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such a spiteful remark might have prompted another opposition leader to seek revenge, to look for the first opportunity to put the Premier in her place. Given Ms. Clark's leadership challenges, goodness knows Mr. Dix had plenty of material with which to work had he so desired. But he bit his tongue. (There were, however, several NDP MLAs incensed by Ms. Clark's jab and the small-mindedness and lack of professionalism they felt it showed).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's difficult not to admire Mr. Dix's efforts to establish a new kind of civility in Victoria, even if you believe it's ultimately pointless. Fact is, from time to time, even members of his own caucus fail to live up to the higher standard of decorum to which he aspires. When you're being tongue-lashed by a competitor, a person's natural instinct is to respond. Mr. Dix believes that some sparring is inevitable and even healthy. He just wants it to be respectful – leave the personal and mean-spirited stuff to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dix is trying to take this approach to all areas of his political life, which has some in his party concerned. Specifically, there is worry about the NDP Leader's pledge to run a clean election campaign with no attack ads. He believes the public is sick of this kind of politics. Polling surveys indicate the same. And yet, sadly, negative advertising has a successful track record in politics, which is why the Liberals, with the help of proxies such as the organization British Columbians for Christy Clark (BC4CC), plan to launch one of the most negative, nasty ad wars the province has ever seen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, it's already begun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BC4CC has started airing spots that focus, in part, on Mr. Dix's “memo to file” imbroglio of well more than a decade ago. This is the document that Mr. Dix, in a moment of misguided loyalty, created and backdated in a bid to help out then NDP premier Glen Clark, the man to whom he was serving as chief of staff at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The communiqué was designed to build a wall between Mr. Clark and the growing scandal arising from the government approval of a casino licence for a friend of the premier's. The whole affair eventually cost both Mr. Clark and Mr. Dix their jobs. Mr. Dix has said on numerous occasions that while the content of the memo was true, his decision to make it look like it had been written months earlier was a mistake for which he apologizes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, it doesn't appear the assault on Mr. Dix's character has had much of an impact. The Liberals are still anywhere from 10 to 18 points back of the NDP depending on the poll. So Mr. Dix's serious-minded, stay-positive approach seems unassailable at the moment. But what happens if the polls begin to tighten? Will Mr. Dix's high road seem as attractive if the lower one on which the Liberals are travelling is paying dividends?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is when Mr. Dix's leadership will be tested. To change course at that point would signal defeat, be a sign that he realizes he can't win with his more affirmative messaging. A major course reversal in the middle of an election campaign would be disastrous. Mr. Dix knows that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he's just as aware that if he wins with his more constructive brand of politics, it could open up a whole new world of possibilities for his party and government. To him, that's a gamble worth taking.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was something familiar I couldn't place about Barack Obama's State of the Union Address, something almost nostalgic. I listened to it like a tune I used to know but had nearly forgotten.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. President was describing a country where higher taxes pay for better public services. A country I might once have called “Canada.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the ideas Mr. Obama put forward are left of where we are now politically in Canada. How much of it he will achieve is yet to be seen, but the vision he laid out for the United States was more Canadian than Canada is today. He might as well have been delivering it in French and English, and then French again, while sewing a Canadian flag on his backpack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were moments in which Mr. Obama was so Canadian-not-American that it was almost as if he wasn't talking about religion in public but was instead singing the McGarrigle sisters: “For the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to combat climate change. Yes, it's true that no single event makes a trend. But the fact is, the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15. Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, and floods – all are now more frequent and intense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We can choose to believe that superstorm Sandy and the most severe drought in decades and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence. Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science – and act before it's too late,” he said in the context of discussing the need to regulate carbon emissions, any mention of which is currently treated as tantamount to an act of treason in this country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the most striking part of Mr. Obama's address was his plan to make quality preschool available to all four-year-olds – because, he explained, studies show that the benefits of that kind of early care reverberate throughout a child's entire education, yet even middle-class parents often cannot afford the cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Every dollar we invest in high-quality early education can save more than seven dollars later on – by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, even reducing violent crime,” he said, as Canadian as a butter tart at a July 1 block party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Essentially he was laying out a plan reminiscent of a not-dissimilar vision for an extended educational system once organized here in Canada – the one Stephen Harper crushed when he cancelled the federal-provincial daycare agreements developed by Paul Martin's Liberals. Now, the country closest to us is cribbing it, plus much of our identity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been a while coming, but the State of the Union Address sealed it; America's now officially the Single White Female of nations. And, America being America, I can't help thinking they're going to turn out to be so much better at being Canada than us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there's ever a Being-Canada Olympics, America will win the bronze medal and then be so extraordinarily jubilant about the win that it will be bumped up to the gold. Because of course that's how the Being-Canada Olympics will work. The Americans will figure that out quickly and train their children to be excessively grateful for their bronze-medal wins from a very young age, thus winning them all the golds. Soon they'll rename the gold the Personal Best Medal, so that no one's feelings get hurt, because they know how to compete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're doomed to fail at our own nationality. Americans will start waiting for other people to applaud before they applaud. They will not get irrationally indignant about alleged affronts to their constitution or their flag, but only about art they think they could have painted. They'll finally stop saying “soda.” And yet, because I'm clinging to what vestiges of my Canadian identity the usurpers from the south have left me, I'll just politely accept that Americans make better Canadians than us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh yes, I think we all should: It's only through our sheer bloody-minded politeness about Americans being better Canadians than us that we'll ultimately win being Canadian back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This will make America unhappy. Confronted by our niceness, the once triumphant Canadian-Americans will put down the Jane Urquhart novels they are dutifully reading or stop mumbling their way through the French portion of the national anthem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They'll look at us sadly. And what we must do then is to look straight back at them and all say “sorry” repeatedly, thus securing our position as the true Canadians for all time.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Palestinians may not have a sovereign state to call their own, but they can certainly lay claim to a rich, distinctive, suddenly influential culinary tradition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not familiar with the Palestinian kitchen? You will be soon enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its green freekeh grains, brightly herbed meats and rosewater-perfumed sweets belong to the “new” Middle Eastern cuisine that keeps topping all the trend lists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps you've heard of Jerusalem: A Cookbook. Written by two renowned London-based chefs who grew up in Jerusalem – Yotam Ottolenghi in the Jewish west, Sami Tamimi on the Arab east side – this bestselling foodie bible has been widely hailed (from the New Yorker to chowhound.com) as the hottest cookbook of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you don't own the book, or are having trouble stocking your pantry with pomegranate molasses, za'atar, tamarind water and other essential yet still elusive ingredients for this next big food fad, you can get a taste for it at Tamam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's nothing remotely fashionable about this small mom-and-pop restaurant on the shabby fringes of Hastings-Sunrise. The walls are sponge-painted orange. An open, cafeteria-style kitchen struts down the middle of the room, fronted by a roll-top salad bar. Discarded pieces of equipment are shoved into corners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners Sobhi Zobaidi (an auteur filmmaker and university lecturer) and his wife, Tamam (a former theatre actress) inherited the whole ugly kit and caboodle from the previous owner and plan to renovate this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their customers – an eclectic assortment of peace activists, cash-strapped students and intrepid foodies (the blogs are going wild over this place) – don't seem to mind the rag-tag ambience. They've come to explore the exotic flavours of this little-known cuisine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what makes it so new and exciting? How does Palestinian food differ from Lebanese, Turkish, Moroccan or even, say, Jewish cuisine? As the authors of Jerusalem point out in their introduction, there are more commonalities than differences. The Jews and Arabs in their Holy Land hometown all eat hummus – although the origin of that hummus is hotly contested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the dishes do look familiar, but usually contain some sort of twist. Mutabal, a baked eggplant dip sprinkled with ground sour-berry sumac, is similar to baba ghanouj, but not so finely ground. Mashed by hand, it's chunkier, heavier and harder to scoop with a thin wedge of whole-wheat pita.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warak, much like dolmas, are rolled grape leaves. But these are stuffed with minced beef instead of rice and vegetables. Packed with parsley and bow-tied with a sweetly stewed tomato, they're little gift bags of garden goodness for the mouth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fried halloumi bears no resemblance to the Greeks' flaming saganaki. It doesn't look like any fried halloumi that I've ever seen. The tangy cheese is oven-melted to golden, papery thin crisps and strewn over chopped tomato and cucumber salad. Cabbage rolls baked in saffron are light and delicate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Keep eating,” Mr. Zobaidi urges. “This food won't take your energy and make you want to take a nap. It gives you energy. When you go back to your office, you're going to feel more alert.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raised in a West Bank refugee camp and educated in New York, the effervescent filmmaker-turned-restaurateur is a consummate host who greets everyone with an infectiously sunny smile. While Tamam cooks behind her makeshift counter, and their daughter amuses herself in the kids' play area, Mr. Zobaidi presides over the dining room taking orders and clearing plates. Well, sometimes. The colourful platters strewn with hot-pink threads of tangy red cabbage often pile up as he lingers tableside, extolling the health benefits of his homeland's traditional fare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tamam's food is all cooked with olive oil, not butter. They don't offer any fried foods. The vegetables are fresh, never frozen. The main dishes – roast lamb, chicken or fish – are served with healthy grains. Some days it's freekeh, a smoky roasted green whole-grain superfood that's being touted as the next quinoa. Other days, it's mujadarah, a homey mash of lentils, rice and caramelized onions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's no wonder Palestinian cuisine is the next new thing. It's healthy, homey, fresh, boldly flavoured and stupendously delicious.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vast majority of Canadians – 85 per cent – now live in provinces governed by women. This is a remarkable transition from even a decade ago. Women are playing increasingly prominent roles not just in government but in law, medicine and academia in Canada, the U.S. and Western Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathleen Wynne, the 59-year-old Premier of Ontario, is the latest leader to join the club of six female premiers. Their ranks include Nunavut Premier Eva Aariak, a 58-year-old grandmother, and B.C. Premier Christy Clark, 47, who recently observed that being a single mother is an asset in her job because it keeps her connected to everyday life. These leaders all prove that a high-impact career and motherhood can indeed be a winning combination.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everywhere, it seems, change is in the air, with one glaring exception: corporate Canada. The pace of change when it comes to gender parity on corporate boards has been glacial. Women account for just 14.4 per cent of all 3,992 board seats at Canada's 500 largest organizations, including publicly traded companies, Crown corporations and Canadian subsidiaries of large multinationals. That percentage has budged only a few points upwards over the last 10 years. Forty-one per cent of companies still have no women at all on their boards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Champions of equality have made arguments about why it behooves corporations to add women to their ranks. A diverse board improves governance and stewardship. Women are more innovative and have an in-bred sense of skepticism. Companies with more female directors are more profitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conventional wisdom has been, Don't worry, the cream will rise to the top. But this has not happened in the corporate world as it has in politics. The sector has not self-corrected. The research, the measuring, the data, the arguments have failed to bring about change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across Europe, the trend has been to set targets or quotas for the inclusion of more women in the public and private sectors. This has happened in Norway, Spain, France, Italy, Iceland and even Malaysia, which passed a law in 2011 requiring corporations to have 30 per cent of women in “decision-making” roles by 2016. In Britain, a government committee issued a report two years ago calling on the largest public companies in the FTSE 100 index to strive for a target of 25 per cent women by 2015. It has had a real impact: between 2011 and 2012, the proportion of women grew to 15.6 per cent from 12.5 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec legislated gender balance on the boards of its Crown corporations in 2006, and recently achieved it. Some influential voices say it is time for the rest of Canada to consider taking action, and at least setting soft internal targets or goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guylaine Saucier, a former director of the Bank of Canada, says her experience in France, where she has helped to recruit talented, competent women for boards, has made her realize the value of intentionally casting the net wider: “I would suspect we have as many good women in Canada as in France, we just have to look for them. Canada has a good governance culture. But there is the danger that we rest on our laurels. I hope we go on leading and innovating.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrice Merrin, chairman of <span class="companylink">CML Healthcare Inc</span>., believes that setting a concrete goal is the only way companies will achieve reform: “Trying to make intellectual arguments for getting women on boards is a time-waster. The wealth that resides in public markets is so important and we want the best possible governance. I don't think that deriving people from a very small, closed pool is the best way.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's Crown corporations, as well as the banking and telecommunications sectors, are already much more representative, in part because they are governed by the federal Employment Equity Act, which encourages preferential hiring for women, the disabled, aboriginals and visible minorities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion Bank</span>, women occupy one-third of executive and board positions. Colleen Johnston, TD's CFO, believes such diversity has helped the bank become more “powerful, flexible and sustainable.” Having senior leaders advocate for greater inclusion has helped drive the change, as well as ensuring all departments include diversity in their business strategies. One-third of executives at the <span class="companylink">Bank of Montreal</span> and the <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span> are also women, while women occupy one quarter of executive roles at the CIBC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Manulife Financial</span> has also made strides. The insurance giant was an early signatory to the Catalyst Accord, a program that asks companies to aim for at least one-quarter of their corporate directors to be women by 2017. Manulife has now exceeded this goal. “You don't find excellence just among men. You adapt your search process to also find excellent women leaders and that is what we have done,” said Gail Cook-Bennett, board chair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bringing greater rigour and transparency to appointments helps break down institutional barriers. Men are often backed by influential sponsors early in their careers who later call on them to sit on boards. A 2012 longitudinal Catalyst study tracked 1,660 MBA graduates from 26 business school in Canada, the U.S., Europe and Asia. It found that men were given more “game-changing” roles, with higher budgets and larger teams of employees, than their female counterparts, even when their level of ambition and education were the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is time to stop analysing the barriers. It is time to emulate the corporations where change has been achieved. A decade from now, if voluntary efforts have not worked, we should not be startled if the public demands more stringent action, perhaps even quotas. Canadian companies, so often considered a source of innovation and leadership, need to take a cue from voters and place trust in the vision and capacity of the entire educated work force. It makes business sense.</p>
