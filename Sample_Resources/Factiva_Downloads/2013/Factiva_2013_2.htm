<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chantards are at it again, doing it for the lulz. If you don't know what those things are, then you are probably not in favour of them.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The anonymous people who post shocking images and racist jokes on the Internet image board known as /b/, which is a part of the Web community known as 4chan, contain among them a few who enjoy malicious pranks, such as publishing Sarah Palin's private e-mails or the intimate pictures of someone else's girlfriend, and those unscrupulous few are known as chantards. If you ask them why they do these things, they say, “for the lulz,” which basically means “for the pleasure of causing pain.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wags at /b/ created quite a successfully nasty Internet meme that crested in popularity, then died, on Monday afternoon. Several media outlets picked up on it before it was revealed to be a prank: You may have seen the reports circulating that teenage Justin Bieber fans were cutting themselves with razor blades and tweeting the gory pictures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea was that they were trying to convince their singing idol to give up marijuana, following the publication of some snapshots of him apparently smoking a joint. About a half a dozen gruesome pictures of arms and razor blades were posted, along with pretty convincing teenage user names and photos and earnest messages for the Bieb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The whole thing was pretty convincing, actually – it's exactly the kind of incident one can imagine happening in an age of hysterical celebrity-following, conservative anti-drug propaganda and the adolescent fixation with self-harm. All those things seemed to combine into one powerfully sad reflection of contemporary mores. But it was actually nastier than that: It was an attempt by some Internet trolls to get young women to cut themselves for real.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We still don't know if it worked or not. We don't know for sure if all the images posted were part of the hoax or if anybody eager for an excuse to publicly cut jumped on the bandwagon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same thing happened with an earlier stunt pulled by 4channers: They were the ones who started a rumour, last October, that Bieber had cancer and that fans were shaving their heads out of solidarity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tweets fooled a few media outlets for a few days. There too, most of the posted images of shaved heads were part of the prank, but who knows who else fell for it and played along?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the most troubling things about the prank is that a lot of people are trying to take credit for it. There is another message board, called 9gag, usually full of mildly amusing photos and cartoons, where users are claiming responsibility for inventing the #cutforbieber hashtag. This is a bit like all the self-styled terrorist groups who claim responsibility for every bomb. These guys take great pride in causing harm</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are they all guys? One can only guess. Guessing is not hard, given the relentless stream of porn pictures that are posted on /b/. One famous screen-grab from the image board shows a few answers to the question, “/b/, how do you get your women?” The first answer was, “Right mouse click &gt; save image.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many apologists for /b/. They argue that because no registration is required, it offers true anonymity, which allows for whistle-blowing and other forms of activism without recrimination. Attacks on Scientology, for example, under the name Anonymous, have been associated with 4chan. Users were also involved in shutting down a white supremacist's website with denial-of-service attacks. If anyone tries to remove any image from the Internet, you can be sure that 4channers will distribute it as widely as they can. The users of /b/ in particular like to think of themselves as crusaders for Internet freedom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But why would a crusader for Internet freedom hate Justin Bieber so? Because all unattractive men do. They hate Justin Bieber because teenage girls love him. It must be terribly frustrating: The more you call the guy a “faggot,” the more girls he seems to get.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Make no mistake: The “Cut For Bieber” prank is simple misogyny. It is not directed at Justin Bieber; its target is teenage girls who don't like the sort of guy who spends his day uploading porn pics and racist jokes on anonymous websites.</p>

Ms. Spence and her supporters need to concede that, in their historic and legitimate grievances with the federal government, they are in effect making demands of the people of Canada. Transparency will only enhance their cause.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since reserves like Attawapiskat are effectively the property of native bands, the local police were probably technically within their rights to expel a television crew that flew into the remote community on Tuesday. But reserves aren't exempt from the Charter of Freedoms, and this isn't just about the rights of the media. It appears that some Attawapiskat residents wanted to tell their story and were looking forward to meeting with the reporter. Their right to express themselves wasn't respected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The instructions to expel the reporter and her crew came from the Chief and the council, according to the acting chief. It is asking a lot of Canadians to trust the legitimacy of a band chief who dismisses the importance of proper accounting practices and won't let her people talk to reporters. You can't lament Third World conditions and then act like a Third World despot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, Ms. Spence does not represent the broader native communities, and she is not officially part of Idle No More. But, at present, she is the most public face of a surging movement to settle long-outstanding issues, one that has resulted in Prime Minister Stephen Harper agreeing to meet with national first nations leaders on Friday. When he does so, it will be as the representative of the taxpayers of Canada, and they will want some questions answered.</p>

The Jan. 10 ceremony is not just a technicality, but a political obligation spelled out in the constitution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if the National Assembly and ultimately the courts have approved Mr. Chavez's absence, Venezuelans deserve better.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Normally a constant presence in print, broadcast and social media, Mr. Chavez, 58, has not spoken publicly since his fourth surgery for cancer on Dec. 11 in Havana. He has not clarified what kind of cancer he has, or what his prognosis is. Medical updates reveal only that he is recovering from a “respiratory insufficiency” following a severe lung infection. Such is the mystery surrounding the illness that there are rumours circulating that Mr. Chavez has already expired, and that his immediate supporters are attempting to suppress this information. No independent medical assessment has been undertaken. Only his family and his political allies, Vice-President Nicolas Maduro and National Assembly President Diosdado Cabello, have had access to him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The regrettable handling of the crisis reflects the degree to which Mr. Chavez has corroded national institutions in Venezuela, eroding judicial and legislative independence during his 14 years in office. There are no meaningful checks and balances left on his authority. It is no surprise that the Supreme Court, stacked with Chavez supporters, ruled that under the constitution Mr. Chavez can be sworn in at a later date, and even in another country. Government leaders are, implausibly, maintaining that Mr. Chavez is fulfilling his duties as head of state, even as he convalesces in Cuba. The Presidents of Uruguay and Bolivia are set to arrive on Thursday in Caracas to join a Chavez rally outside the presidential palace. Even Fidel Castro oversaw a more orderly transition, ceding control of the Cuban government to his brother, Raul, following his own bout of ill health in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts speculate that Mr. Chavez is too weak to give clear direction. “His allies may be stalling for time,” suggests Max Cameron, a <span class="companylink">University of British Columbia</span> political scientist. The opposition has rightly challenged the court's constitutional interpret-</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ation, and is warning of the possibility of a military uprising. They should keep up the pressure. The only way to resolve the political impasse in this country, which has the world's largest proven oil reserves, is either for Mr. Chavez to resume his duties or, if he is unable to do so, for an election to be called and a fit leader to take over, the sooner the better.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British Columbia had a banner year for mining investment in 2012. But the $463-million poured into the ground represents just a handful of successful projects. Most junior mining companies were running up against skeptical investors who have watched one too many projects fall apart because of the endless battle over ownership of the land and the resources below ground.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mining industry doesn't need to follow the Idle No More movement to know it has a problem. For decades, conflict with first nations over mining resources has been blamed for curtailing the industry's growth. When mining executives meet this month for their annual conference in Vancouver, they'll do so in an aboriginal-themed pavilion, part of a growing recognition that successful ventures will hinge on the co-operation of affected first nations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Dec. 27 court ruling offers a new reason to try to build a better relationship. The decision directs the Yukon government to consult with first nations before allowing prospectors to stake a mining claim. In B.C.,where most of the Crown land is still subject to aboriginal land claims, the ruling can't be ignored.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 16-page unanimous decision of the Yukon Court of Appeal – penned by three B.C. Appeal Court judges – gives the government there one year to introduce a consultation mechanism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The honour of the Crown demands that it take into account Aboriginal claims before divesting itself of control over land,“ the decision states. “What is required is that consultations be meaningful, and that the system allow for accommodation to take place, where required, before claimed Aboriginal title or rights are adversely affected.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both B.C. and the Yukon freely hand out stakes for mining claims on Crown land – in British Columbia, you can even register a claim online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To grow the industry, the province is looking at cutting red tape for some exploration and mining activities. That direction could simply exacerbate conflict, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both the industry and first nations are looking to the provincial government to craft a framework that would allow more development to move ahead without blockades and litigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are looking for leadership,” said Gavin Dirom, president of the Association for Mineral Exploration B.C., in an interview. “We're looking for more direction, more guidance, particularly in accommodation and consultation. That would be a government-to-government discussion and we encourage them to sit down and have some fruitful and meaningful dialogue.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry is also waiting to see whether the Yukon government will appeal the court ruling, or amend its laws as directed. “There are implications that need to be taken seriously,” said Mr. Dirom, “not just for our industry, but any resource development on the land base here in British Columbia and across the country.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His association hasn't been idle. The coming Mineral Exploration Roundup conference will have the largest-ever contingent of aboriginal representation. One of the guest speakers is Dave Porter, CEO of the B.C. First Nations Energy and Mining Council, who predicts the Yukon ruling will have far-reaching consequences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're going to see a ripple effect in B.C.,” Mr. Porter said in an interview. “The fallout is going to be a chill with respect to mining investments and I anticipate as a result of this decision in the Yukon, it will result in litigation renewed in British Columbia with respect to the free-entry system.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Porter says there are many B.C. aboriginal communities prepared to move ahead with mining projects – provided they are included in the planning and profit-sharing. In two cases, the province has signed off on revenue-sharing agreements, but there is no clear framework.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would require a broader conversation, one that Mines Minister Rich Coleman needs to take part in.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that David Nonis has been pushed into the Toronto Maple Leafs general manager's chair, there are a number of things he needs to do.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most important involves upgrades to the lineup, especially in goal, but luckily for Nonis there is not much he can do there until the NHL's 740 players finish their ratification vote by the weekend on a new collective agreement. That gives Nonis, 46, a couple of days to figure out how to handle his new bosses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, more than anything, will be crucial to his long-term survival. Nonis did receive a quick, hard lesson in this when Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd. chairman Larry Tanenbaum and president Tom Anselmi told him his good friend Brian Burke was fired and he was the replacement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was lesson No. 1: Tanenbaum and Anselmi are more functionaries than overlords. The ones who call the shots are the ones with four of the six seats on the MLSE board, <span class="companylink">BCE Inc</span>., chairman George Cope and <span class="companylink">Rogers Communications Inc</span>., chairman Nadir Mohamed and their two sidekicks. It was Cope who led the charge on Burke, according to those who should know, although Burke's abrasive and loud public style was not a hill, to use the current NHL vernacular, that Mohamed seemed interested in dying on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by firing Burke days before a new season started and months after they actually took charge of MLSE and months after the entire NHL sat idle in a lockout, Cope and Mohamed showed the world they can match any previous Leaf owner in buffoonery. This is why Send In The Clowns is the MLSE corporate anthem. It is why the Maple Leafs get no respect in NHL governors' meetings even though they make more money than anyone else in the league.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonis, then, needs to make sure he fits the corporate image demanded by Cope and his pals. This is not a big problem for him, as Nonis is the opposite of Burke in both disposition and philosophy. He is a quiet, conservative fellow who operates by consensus-building among the Leafs' large stable of executives, not a my-way-or-the-highway guy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, he will have to be aware his new bosses may dress well and use all the proper corporate buzzwords but they are just as capable of slapstick as crazy old Harold Ballard ever was. He also needs to be aware the Rogers and BCE factions are capable of turning on each other even though they pledged to always vote their four shares as a block and he could end up being collateral damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to the job itself, Nonis is not in any difficulty. He's done it before and done it well, serving as the <span class="companylink">Vancouver Canucks</span> GM from 2004 to 2008 after Burke was fired from that job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Burke's right-hand-man with the Leafs, Nonis had a big say in the team's current roster. At least the Cope-Mohamed sideshow doesn't mean the Leafs have to start all over again with a new GM and a new program on the eve of the season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first roster job will be to pry goaltender Roberto Luongo away from the Canucks. As the fellow who made the trade that brought Luongo, 33, to the Canucks from the <span class="companylink">Florida Panthers</span> in 2006, Nonis has more enthusiasm for a deal than Burke did. It doesn't mean a trade will get done for sure but it does mean it won't be for a lack of trying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonis also acknowledged he needs to get more size and skill at centre and elsewhere among the forwards. Burke was never able to land the big No. 1 centre the Leafs need to make everyone forget his biggest mistake, the Phil Kessel trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is intriguing here is that the <span class="companylink">Anaheim Ducks</span>' dynamic duo, centre Ryan Getzlaf and winger Corey Perry, will be unrestricted free agents this summer. They were a big part of the 2007 Stanley Cup winner Burke put together when he was running that team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no doubt if Burke had survived until the summer he would have made a big play for Getzlaf and Perry. Don't be surprised if Nonis does the same, as the Ducks are not the richest team in the league. In any event, there will be no shortage of encouragement from the media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking of media encouragement, do not look for Nonis to listen to certain parties who would like to Kessel shipped quickly out of town. Nonis is not likely to part with a 30-goal scorer just to erase memories of a bad trade.</p>

Based on components like lip curve and eye crinkling, the smile's quality is analyzed by OKAO Vision technology and measured out of 100. Then the computer weighs in: “Just a bit more!” or “Smile like you're happy!” The worker corrects her smile, and the day begins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OMRON, the Japanese company behind “smile degree estimation,” released a tablet version last year, as well as announcing a new technology that can measure seven different facial expressions: happiness, surprise, neutrality, fear, disgust, anger and sadness (bosses likely prefer the first three). Smiling at work is hardly a new directive, and the employees reportedly didn't mind, so why does this futuristic present seem so chilling?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was a forced-smiling worker for years, waitressing and temping and grinning, often atop a strain of fury. I'd leave my temp office with a new assignment and a reminder: “Don't forget to smile! You're a [insert name of agency here] girl!” It wasn't the smiling that irked but the condescension.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when calling “Hubba hubba!” isn't socially acceptable any more, “Smile, honey!” is still on the streets. One young woman blogger on Feministing writes about being bothered for her serious countenance: “Since when has demanding an unhappy person smile ever made them suddenly stop being unhappy?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The smile has always carried a freight of signals, social and emotional. If technology is imposing a new set of expectations on workers about how they look, then more than ever it seems we can't take the smile at face value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in my 20s, I recall being startled occasionally by a smile policeman. I always wanted to shout: “I can't help my Norwegian mean face!” (Now that I'm older, no one cares how grumpy I am – evidence that “Smile!” is bound to conventional beauty expectations.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your expression as you walk to <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> is no one's business, but smiling in the working world may matter. A recent academic paper published in The Fibreculture Journal by Mark Gawne, a PhD student at the University of Sydney, examined the use of OMRON scanners (they are mostly in the service and hospitality industries, including at a truck stop, to measure drivers' alertness). Gawne notes that smile scanning forces a new kind of labour on the labourer: “It compels the worker's body to perform affect.” On one hand, the machines are no different than my finger-wagging temp agency manager, but erasing human interaction from the smile edict feels fairly Big Brother – computers, not bosses or employees, become workplace agents of regulation and control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, all work is performance, a suppression of certain emotions (and an amplification of others) in service of making a living – sociologists call this “emotional labour.” Smiling is requisite emotional labour in many jobs, but it's a complicated signal: Smiling is as much about social cues as it is emotion – politicians know this intimately. Last fall, a Chinese official was widely condemned when a photo went viral showing him smiling at the site of an accident that killed 36 people. Joe Biden's smirking and chuckling is the most remembered aspect of the vice-presidential debates, interpreted as either arrogance or wisdom. Recently, NDP MP Olivia Chow revealed that a rare nerve disorder has given her a lopsided smile. People will “just have to imagine that I am smiling,” she said, indirectly acknowledging that an unsmiling politician is suspect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Failing to smile may have a detrimental effect, at least in service. A study published in The Journal of Applied Psychology detailed 117 interactions between staff and customers at a Seoul mall. Workers' smiles were mirrored by customers, and interestingly, both groups reported feeling more positive – smiling caused a good-mood loop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet, smile software still seems creepy. Perhaps it's because I'm a woman, worried that those “Smile, honey!” guys are going to expect us to carry self-scanning tablets in our purses. Studies show that women, often the bearers of the emotional weight of relationships, smile more than men. One explanation is that women have less power, and smiling is a form of appeasement, like the forced smiles of the below-stairs staff in Downton Abbey. The “Smile!” dictate crams women into a false dichotomy – the age-old angel/whore split. If you don't smile, you're a bitch, like Victoria Beckham. And if you smile too much, you might come off as disingenuous, overplaying your feminine hand and sucking up to power, like Katie Couric.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Putting aside the strange sexual politics of a grin, smile scanners in the workplace symbolize an erosion of trust. Their existence implies that workers aren't smart enough to regulate their own smiles in the interest of their bosses and themselves. But a little honesty in our expressions is what separates us from beauty queens and robots.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are in the midst of a Jazz Age revival. Downton Abbey's third season, set amid the social upheaval of the 1920s, debuted on Sunday to record ratings. This summer, Baz Luhrmann's much-anticipated Great Gatsby will look to mine the decade's glamorous fashions as successfully as last year's Oscar winner, The Artist. Even violent crime is being reworked by the nostalgia machine: On Boardwalk Empire, Al Capone reads as a toothless throwback compared to the shadowy masterminds of Homeland. Gucci, meanwhile, has launched a flapper-inspired line, while bars ride the retro wave, replacing bartenders with “mixologists” brewing cocktails fit for a young Hemingway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why does 2013 wish it were 1923?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's natural that, during a financial slump, we'd want to revisit a past boom time for a bit of relief. Shifting our gaze to the 1920s helps us avoid looking at an economy straight out of the 1930s. And the Jazz Age strikes a nerve right now because we love how the people of that era, at least in our collectively imagined version of it, seemed to relish their relative prosperity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Twenties, as we now remember them, can't be anything but “freewheeling” or “roaring.” The drinks flowed without end, and people danced all night to wild jazz. Every conversationalist was as witty as Dorothy Parker and all the women looked chic and dangerous with their bobbed hair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Easily forgotten in the standard Roaring Twenties narrative is the bittersweet sense of loss and renewal that fuelled this fast life. The global sigh of relief coupled with more than a little survivor's guilt. Coming through the trauma of war imbued people with a need for togetherness, while the fragility of life was further underscored by a global flu pandemic that would, by some estimates, claim more victims than the war itself. Behind the cocktails and the costume parties, people were grasping for connection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Gerald Murphy, one of the shining lights of the expat coterie in Europe that Gertrude Stein dubbed the Lost Generation, later recalled: “There was such affection between everybody. You loved your friends and wanted to see them every day, and usually you did see them every day. It was like a great fair, and everybody was so young.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, communing with a decade when people seemed to have truly savoured their fun and their relationships helps us feel comfortable with measuring our own success in terms of fullness of experience. We can't spend like it was 1993 or 1953, but we can party like it's 1923. A strong drink, a daring haircut, a night spent dancing with friends – these small pleasures are within our reach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With traditional markers of success becoming less and less attainable (perhaps even less desirable), we might as well enjoy ourselves. The title of Calvin Tomkins's memoir of Gerald and Sara Murphy says it all: Living Well is the Best Revenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We, too, are grasping for connection. Rather than money, we amass friendships, romances and memories. We hone our little crafts, pour our energies into art and love, and turn our lifestyles into performances. Status is no longer measured in goods acquired but in richness of time lived, with one's levels of fun documented and monitored online. As with the so-called Lost Generation, we aren't so much conspicuous consumers as conspicuous adventurers, striving to create our own Golden Age.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm in my early 50s, divorced and living alone. Two years ago, I started dating a politician. I told him I wouldn't see him if he were married, that I didn't want a “discreet relationship.” He said he was living with his long-standing common-law partner, but there was no love there. He described their relationship as strictly “daily routine and friendship.” I believed him and trusted him fully. We were happy and in love, travelled together a lot and went to many political functions together. Six months ago he proposed, saying everything would work out, and I said yes. But I started getting suspicious, because we only planned trips for dates his partner was out of town. And whenever his family got together, for dinner or holidays, she was always there. I felt left out, betrayed, and humiliated. He kept giving me excuses to postpone our being together: a death in the family, election, etc. Finally, I gave him an ultimatum: Move out by December. He e-mailed me that his heart is aching and he wants to have dinner with me for a serious talk. I refused. I knew what he'd say: more lies. My family and I feel he is a man of low character, a dishonest man with no integrity. What should I do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pursuant to my New Year's Resolution 143-a (“Be kinder and less curmudgeonly”), I'm going to resist the temptation to use the word “naïveté” or express disbelief that anyone could be so, hmm … let's say “suffused with refreshingly childlike innocence” that they'd actually be surprised they were lied to – by a politician.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It'd be like kicking a fluffy, friendly little puppy when it's confused and lost and the snow's started to fall, and Nuevo Dave-o 2013's not like that, folks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, please allow me to make a couple of general points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first seems obvious, but I'm never-endingly amazed at how many women fall afoul of it: If you let a man have his cake and eat it too, there's a good chance you'll wind up with a pie in the face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ladies, I have no hard statistics to back this up (impossible to obtain, because the whole matter is ipso facto enshrouded with lies, like the summit of Kilimanjaro is with clouds), but from what I've observed, if you're “dating” a sweet-talking married – or, whatever, common-law – man, and you're wondering how it will all play out, take a long look in the mirror and imagine the face you see there with hot tears rolling down its cheeks, because most of the time that's how it ends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's like we say in poker: “If you don't know who the sucker is at the table, it's probably you.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though, true, it's not always the case … and I suppose philandering married men who stay with their wives secretly bless those who don't – because it keeps the hope alive in their mistresses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(I hasten to add that not all men are this way, ladies. Canis mendacious obesus – common name “big fat liars” – is merely a subspecies of Homo sapiens, though it's true there seem to be enough of them that they're giving the whole breed a bad name.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And of course these doggy dudes stuff you full of lies, like a piñata. It's (their) second nature. But don't listen to their sugary speeches. Ignore their words. Actions speak louder than. When they speak, all you should hear is: Rrruff! Rowf! Arf! Even if they rear up on their hind legs, a bunch of flowers in one forepaw and a diamond ring in another, don't be fooled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remember also: Just because something's true doesn't mean it isn't also a lie. Sure, maybe this guy's relationship with his common-law partner has become humdrum and routine. So? A mensch ends one relationship before beginning another. Everyone knows that. I'm far from perfect but I knew this even at age 19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next point is a little subtler, I think. You hear a lot of people complain bitterly about their exes in the same manner you do about your – uh, whatever this guy is to you (“boyfriend”?), and take no responsibility for whatever happened or went wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But listen: If it's true that he's “a man of low character, a dishonest man with no integrity,” then what does that make you? At the very least, a poor judge of character. And almost willfully blinkered and complicit in your own deception. I mean, Nuevo Dave-o 2013's trying to be a nice guy, but come on: He “proposed” to you while in a long-standing common-law relationship with another woman and all you do is throw your bonnet in the air and say “Yes, yes, a thousand times yes!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And where were your friends and your family, so full of comments now? Why weren't they red-flagging this from the beginning, when you could have used a little tough love and wise counsel? I got a sense from your question that deep down you know what you need to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bottom line: Dump the chump, and move on. The good news is: You only wasted two years on Mr. Forked Tongue, not decades. I know it's hard to find someone in your 50s (my mother had to do it, after her divorce), but from what I've observed, it gets even harder later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Henceforward, unless you enjoy pain, suffering and heartache, do yourself a favour and only “date,” and become engaged to, men who are single, and live alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What am I supposed to do now?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– Pauline Kael, reviewing Last Tango in Paris in The New Yorker</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing dampens a movie's legacy quite like controversy, and few movies crested a wave of controversy as tidal as Last Tango in Paris, which had its theatrical opening in New York 40 years ago this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After months of transatlantic static about the movie's allegedly explicit sexual content, featuring the 48-year-old Marlon Brando (freshly rejuvenated by The Godfather) and a 20-year-old unknown named Maria Schneider, Last Tango had its pantingly anticipated premiere on the closing night of the New York Film Festival in October, 1972.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Yorker's faultlessly heat-seeking movie critic Pauline Kael was there, and after she saw the film, she talked her boss and editor, William Shawn, into running a review months before the movie's actual opening. According to Brian Kellow's recent biography of Kael, the properly cautious Shawn was initially reluctant, but Kael persuaded him this was more than just a movie. It was history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shawn gave in and Kael went to work on what would become one of the most famous movie reviews ever published. Here's how it started:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Bernardo Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris was presented for the first time on the closing night of the New York Film Festival, October 14, 1972: That date should become a landmark in movie history comparable to May 29, 1913 – the night Le Sacre du Printemps was first performed – in music history.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The review, which ran for 3,500 words over several pages, had the desired effect. Everyone was talking about Last Tango in Paris: There was a photo spread of Brando and Schneider at carnal play – her naked, him not so much – in Playboy magazine, both Time and Newsweek ran cover stories on the film and, in an unprecedented marketing ploy, United Artists ran Kael's entire review in a two-page ad in The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span>. By the time January rolled around, with the movie finally scheduled to meet the public in that city (it would open a month later in the rest of the United States and Canada), you were more likely to find someone who admitted to supporting Richard Nixon than who hadn't heard of Last Tango.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I had to use fake ID to see it when it opened in St. Catharines, Ont., but nothing was going to stop me. I was a 15-year-old die-hard Brando fanatic and movie nerd, and if it was good enough for Playboy, it was bad enough for me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Tango knocked me sideways on that first viewing, though I probably couldn't tell you why – as much, I suspect, to do with the nudity (hers), dirty talk (his), butter scene (both) and a searingly raw Brando performance as anything else. But that was enough: I've probably seen the movie a dozen times since, and each time with a stronger conviction of just how chained to its historical moment it is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Tango doesn't date well at all, but that's why it remains so compelling. As a glimpse of what transgression looked like in January, 1973 – not only to Pauline Kael but to so many people around the world – the movie is as valuable a time capsule as a garage-sale stack of Playboys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In case you don't know, and by now there are probably millions who don't, Last Tango was directed by the Italian enfant terrible Bernardo Bertolucci. An international movie-world sensation largely because of his previous film The Conformist – featuring Jean-Louis Trintignant and Dominique Sanda, whom the director had imagined for Tango – Bertolucci was inspired to make the movie by an erotic fantasy he had of a sexual tryst with a complete stranger in an apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike Bertolucci's previous films, which had been tightly scripted and executed, Last Tango was a largely spontaneous affair, and only made more so when Bertolucci cast the legendary method icon Brando as the embittered, angry and self-loathing middle-aged widower Paul. Seeing just how averse the infamously prickly actor was to rehearsal and memorization, Bertolucci encouraged Brando to simply dig as deeply in his own history as he could go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And dig Brando did, further inside than he'd ever gone, and surfacing with more personal stuff – concerning his past, his family and intense insecurity – than anyone was prepared to see. Certainly not Bertolucci, who realized he was getting the performance from Brando that everyone had been waiting decades for, and certainly not Brando, who vowed after making the movie that he'd never put himself through that again. And he didn't: From there on he worked just for the money, gradually burying both the method and his beauty beneath 300-plus pounds of flesh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the sex? Good question. Possibly the least interesting thing about Last Tango today is what made it so shocking once upon a time, which says a lot about how quickly sexual controversy expires compared to any other form of outrage. Today's eye will spot the simulated nature of the various acts way more quickly than back then, when persistent rumours flew that they were really doing it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As if. But in a way, the diminished sexual outrage allows a much clearer view of Last Tango, which more than ever looks like a master class in unbridled method indulgence. It's Brando's movie and he knows it – so does Bertolucci – and if there's one thing the film did more than any other, and for better or worse, it was provide us with a glimpse of what the century's greatest movie actor would do if he could do exactly what he wanted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other thing that now seems clearer than ever is how sadly ill-served Maria Schneider – who died in 2011 at 58, after years of wishing she'd never made Last Tango – was by the movie and the frenzy it generated. For years, all one could absorb from the film was Brando, the sex, the dirty wordplay, the butter scene and Schneider's abundant natural assets. What time has done is magnified the power and bravery of her performance, to the point where you can watch the movie now and it almost becomes about her: a young woman trying to navigate her way through the various roles imposed on her by men, and in the end refusing them all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, that's probably the most “liberating” thing about this otherwise time-locked curio, although I'm pretty sure that's not what Pauline Kael was talking about. No one would have lined up around the block for that.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's accepted wisdom that no one won in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> lockout. That's the impression you'd get from commissioner Gary Bettman's grovelling media apologia on Wednesday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there was one player in the drama who came out ahead. Social media, the new voice in the field of <span class="companylink">NHL</span> opinion, emerged as a powerful voice by defying both the league and traditional media who have long brushed them off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As a journalistic tool, social media ruled the lockout,” said Puck Daddy blogger Greg Wyshynski. “The final night of the lockout was almost a <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>-exclusive event, with fans all over the world following the breaking news in real time. Countless stories were broken on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> first. Reporters camped out at the CBA talks tweeted information before they blogged it or reported it on TV.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anti-lockout sites found traction on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. NoHockeyLockout.com (“Giving the Fans a voice to save our sport!”), stopthelock2012.com and NHLexpertpicks.com are among a few sites that hammered the issue. The tone was anti-NHL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Player agent Allan Walsh of Octagon, a prodigious tweeter on behalf of the NHLPA during the lockout, called <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>'s performance the past four months “a game changer” in how hockey is covered. After the previous lockout, when the league and mainstream media dominated the flow of information, Walsh said, “the fans' anger had a seat at the table [because of social media this time]. The voice of players could be heard, discussing the issues with fans directly in an aggregate community. Look at one Youtube video, Together We Can, had 1,325,863 hits.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That attention brought varying degrees of success for those posting, Wyshynski said. “The [initial] support for the players because of this was massive, but it eventually gave way to ‘we blame both sides' from a lot of fans. Soon, the players were getting flamed on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> for innocuous comments; and in the cases of Derek Roy's car and Evander Kane's stacks of dollar bills in Vegas, some fans took issue with the alleged disconnect between players ‘crying poverty' yet flaunting riches.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also created backlash for those such as Walsh, who engaged in heated debates online. The Los Angeles-based agent is unfazed. “If I ever cared about what other people thought I wouldn't be true to myself. I'm just one little <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> feed, they can follow me or they can disagree or unfollow me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To many supporters <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>'s success was also a rebuke for mainstream media. Describing it as a “tool to keep journalists honest,” prolific hockey researcher and contributor Tyler Dellow (mc79hockey on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>) said in an e-mail, “the fact that there are a lot of smart and well-educated people on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> means that fans who were following the right people were able to learn a lot of interesting things from people who are outside the media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Internet provides people who wouldn't otherwise have a forum with one; in many cases, this is a terrible idea but in a few cases it's really good. If you knew who to follow on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, you got a lot of excellent information.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The emergence of social media's power and influence was a transformation the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> either ignored or ridiculed, to its peril. Deputy commissioner Bill Daly criticized the “uninformed ramblings” of <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, while the league made few if any attempts to get its message to its connected fan base beyond the “disappointed, very disappointed, very-very disappointed” meme. As a result, the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> and commissioner Bettman were pounded in the <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> community. Hence Bettman's abject apology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ironically, the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> could have found all the research it needed to gauge public opinion on its reckless gambit during the lockout. “The [fans'] interest, or lack thereof, is entirely measurable. It's silly for the media to speculate on what fan response will be, or conduct silly polls, when the data exists via social media.,” Jesse Hirsh, president of Metaviews.ca, said in an e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This go-round they could measure fan interest, they could measure that geographically, and they could project how much market or audience they're losing and thus how hard it will be to get it back to the numbers they need,” Hirsh said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heading into a pivotal weekend in the Ontario Liberal leadership race, it was about as strong a statement as a candidate could make.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a Thursday-morning press conference, Kathleen Wynne introduced John Wilkinson – a much-coveted former minister previously seen to be either neutral or leaning toward Sandra Pupatello – as her new campaign chair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, Glen Murray turned up to announce that he was abandoning his own candidacy to throw his support behind Ms. Wynne as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Murray is the very epitome of a downtown Liberal; Mr. Wilkinson is an unflashy former minister who serves as a flag-bearer for the Liberals' diminished rural ranks. Suffice it to say, they bring different things to the table. But together, they also offered the one thing Ms. Wynne's campaign team really wants: a sense of overpowering momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that seems an obvious aim for any leadership candidate, it's not. The sort of convention the Liberals will hold later this month, for which they will select delegates this weekend, has some history of “Anybody but …” movements. So front-runners are sometimes happy to keep their heads down and be as inoffensive as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wynne appears to have surmised that she has the opposite challenge. Very few Liberals dislike her; she's thoughtful, approachable, and displays less ego than most politicians at her level. But they do wonder if she's got what it takes to lead their party into a general election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next to Ms. Pupatello, a colourful personality whose main message is that she's a fighter who can go head-to-head with opposition leaders Tim Hudak and Andrea Horwath, the comparatively bookish Ms. Wynne can come off as unassuming. It's also impossible to spend much time in the company of Liberals without hearing questions about whether a relatively left-of-centre urbanite can compete enough outside Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting Mr. Wilkinson on board will help address that latter concern. And both endorsements were shows of strength that cut into Ms. Pupatello's central message that she's the one Liberals should want leading them into battle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, too, is much of the other muscle-flexing Ms. Wynne has been doing lately. At Thursday's event, her supporters handed out flyers listing the various ways she's ahead of the other five candidates – most Liberals seeking delegate spots on her behalf, most donors, most volunteers making phone calls, and so on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of these stats are more meaningful than others. But there's no denying that hers is the best-organized of the campaigns. And if she comes out of this weekend with the most elected delegates, as appears likely, even Ms. Pupatello's advantage among party elites automatically granted votes at the convention could start to erode.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through all this, Ms. Wynne is personally going out of her way to be as respectful to the other candidates and their supporters as possible. Her campaign will be counting on her usual niceness to counterbalance the more uncharacteristic swagger.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One halcyon day at the University of Winnipeg last October, we stood across from each other in a bond of fellowship: one presenting the other with a sacred Anishinaabe pipe. Elders had requested this ceremony as a way to build bridges between the indigenous and non-indigenous communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To answer the obvious first question, the pipe is loaded with tobacco. To answer the obvious second one, the pipe itself represents a communion with the spiritual realm, the gifting of it a great honour. The ceremony itself created another sort of communion as first nations leaders rubbed shoulders with Winnipeg's business elite.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Community members of all age, class and colour laughed, ate and celebrated together. There was a delegation that day from a Ghanaian university. This is the image of Canada we hope they hold on to: as one that's strengthened and enriched by the indigenous peoples of this land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Idle No More movement marches its way into our national consciousness, it has become too easy to forget that this country began with co-operation between indigenous and European peoples. The responses have divided many, making supporters of some “average Canadians” and drawing vehement and, occasionally, vitriolic opposition from others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While discussion always strengthens democracy, we ought not to get too caught up in the bickering to ignore the broader opportunity that Idle No More offers us: the chance to engage in nation-building, to make the country we love stronger. Canada's future is strongly tied to the well-being of its indigenous peoples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a “baby boom” happening in first nations, Inuit and Métis communities. This as we face a shortage of skilled labour in many parts of the country. Surely some of that future labour force should be found among first peoples. Remember that 2007 report from the Centre for the Study of Living Standards that shows if indigenous peoples were able to achieve the same level of education as non-indigenous Canadians by 2017, the country's GDP would increase by more than $160-billion?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government estimates there are natural resource projects worth $500-billion to be developed in the next decade. Our Constitution directs that we have a duty to consult the indigenous people in whose backyards those resources lie. Many in industry have already recognized that better relationships with indigenous people are cultivated at the negotiating table rather than in the courtroom or on the picket line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Canadians may fear that they'll be worse off or face a higher tax burden if indigenous people do better. But the nation's well-being is not a zero-sum game. Right now, there are thousands of young indigenous people who face much longer odds on the road to success than the average child. If we help them better fulfill their potential, they'll eventually contribute more to our society. As the first peoples do better, we'll all do better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a strong moral argument in favour of doing right by this country's first peoples as well. Idle No More has garnered international attention, in the form of solidarity protests and also from some serious media outlets. Do Canadians really want to stand in front of the world opposed to equal and equitable opportunities for first nations, Inuit and Métis children? Do we really want to say we're a country that dishonours its treaty commitments? We think not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indigenous people are standing up for themselves, but they're also standing up for the benefit of all Canadians. Their cultures call on them to be stewards and protectors of the land, and so they raise legitimate concerns about the future of our environment. This will benefit all of our descendants. Their internal dialogue, while sometimes full of rancour and discord, reminds us of the spirited nature of democracy. They're revitalizing cultures that still have reams of untapped wisdom and knowledge to share with the world. As indigenous peoples young and old, professional and working class, take to the streets and social media, we must ask ourselves one question: What are we doing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been a major shift in the past few weeks. The seeds of a new relationship are here, but we must work together to sow them. The pipe ceremony we shared last fall offers a glimpse at a way forward. In the words of a great Lakota leader, “it is not necessary for eagles to be crows.” At some time in the future, we can argue about which side are eagles and which side are crows. For now, let's celebrate each other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's work toward mutually beneficial solutions. Let's be divided no more.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Something wonderful is happening in Quebec cinema. A young generation of risk-taking filmmakers is coming of age, and the world is sitting up and taking notice. For the third year in a row, a Montreal director has made a movie nominated for a best foreign-language film at the Oscars. These three movies – Rebelle, Monsieur Lazhar and Incendies – are tough stuff. Acts of brutal violence are central to all three. Often movies premised on such violence repel, but these captivate and engage. Two of the films, Rebelle and Incendies, are set mostly far from Canada, which means big production and financing challenges. They are films of a very high order.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We can only hope the rest of Canada is sitting down to watch and enjoy Quebec movies, and that filmmakers in all parts of the country are drawing inspiration from the success of Kim Nguyen (Rebelle), Denis Villeneuve (Incendies) and Philippe Falardeau (Monsieur Lazhar).</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is Quebec cinema so successful? “More support to do riskier work, and hence develop stronger talent,” says Daniel Cross, the chairman of the Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema at Montreal's Concordia University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province, because of its linguistic uniqueness, has fostered a sense of the importance of culture. Filmmakers receive generous support from government agencies (Quebec makes 30 feature films a year), and aspiring talent can look to development programs such as Jeunes Créateurs. There's a star system unlike anything in the rest of Canada. There are mentors. There's confidence. And there's an audience with high expectations. “We know we're watching among the best-made movies in the world,” Prof. Cross says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not a slight against some strong filmmakers in the rest of Canada – including David Cronenberg, Atom Egoyan and Sarah Polley, all of whom have reaped nominations at the Oscars – to note that Quebec's film industry is especially vibrant. “A generation of filmmakers is at their peak right now,” says Luc Déry, the president of micro-scope inc., the Montreal production company that produced Monsieur Lazhar and Incendies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In their openness to the world and their technical and storytelling excellence, Quebec is creating films that deserve a wide audience.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two provincial health ministers have scrubbed the usual clichés and begun to tell their citizens an inconvenient truth.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's Fred Horne and Ontario's Deb Matthews, rather than blathering on about Canada's having the best health-care system in the world, now tell audiences that this country has an underperforming, expensive one by international standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This statement of fact, supported by international comparative studies, was political heresy until recently. Canadians were repeatedly told – and they loved being told – that Canada's health care was the best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, at least a few provincial leaders have dropped the clichés, which were never supported by hard evidence anyway. From this new starting point – truth – serious discussion can begin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Little progress, after all, could occur from clichés – why consider change if you have the best of something?)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Something else happened recently, too. Canadians no longer believe, according to the latest public opinion data from the Environics Institute, that more money is the answer to what ails the system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade ago, that seemed to be the answer. Roy Romanow's commission said so, based in part on what citizens told it and on public opinion surveys at the time. Governments apparently thought so, too, since they agreed to spend an additional $41-billion over the next decade – indexed at 6 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The public now seems to understand that all that money prevented things from getting worse but didn't make them discernibly better – at least not tens of billions of additional dollars better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So now, according to the Environics Institute, only 32 per cent of respondents think there's “not enough funding for the system,” as opposed to 55 per cent who blame “inefficient management of the system” for the problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Inefficient management” is an elastic phrase. Who's management? The provincial health ministry? Regional health authorities? Hospital and community care administrators? Family clinics? Care provision inside institutions? Maybe “inefficient management” means too much care in hospitals and not enough in communities with home care, nursing homes or long-term care? Or all of the above?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Inefficient management,” therefore, doesn't really tell us much, except that people seem to think it's more important than lots more money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians don't want to pay more in tax for health care. They reject this option, 56 per cent to 42 per cent, in the Environics Institute survey. A “small” user fee for seeing a doctor or visiting an emergency room? Rejected, but only by 51 per cent to 46 per cent. Cutting back on services covered by public health care? Absolutely not, by 72 per cent to 24 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What about private payment? The institute asked whether Canadians should have the right to buy private health care – here comes the condition – “if they do not receive timely access to services in the public system” – and here comes another condition – “even if this might weaken the principle of universal access to health care for all Canadians because some people might have quicker access to services.” Fifty-five per cent said yes, 43 per cent no. There's more openness there than we might have expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What about “giving Canadians the option to pay out of their own pockets for faster access to Canadian hospitals, or to specialized services such as MRIs and cancer care?” A split verdict: 49 per cent opposed, 48 per cent in favour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One poll can hardly be considered definitive. As you can see in the Environics Institute survey, the answers depend in part on the conditions attached to the questions. Nonetheless, it would appear Canadians don't want to pay more, but they don't want anything taken away from health care, either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But respondents did say they wanted a full-blown public drug plan to cover any medications that “a patient and their doctors agree are the most effective treatment.” Great, except respondents weren't asked how to pay for such a plan, and the majority don't want to pay additional taxes for health care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians' instincts are partly right: Heaps of more money won't make the system more efficient. We learned that lesson in the past decade. Where their instincts go awry, typically, is believing they can get more services without paying more for them.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2006, Canada has contributed $1-billion in aid to Haiti. Assessing the effectiveness of this aid is crucial, and it is no surprise that Julian Fantino, who became Minister of International Co-operation six months ago, would wish to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But publicly announcing Canada's decision not to send the country any more “blank cheques” is a strange way to assess accountability and transparency. “Are we going to take care of their problems forever?” he asked. “They also have to take charge of themselves.” His comments prompted Don Cherry to send out this tweet: “Are we nuts?”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This framing of the many challenges facing Haiti is clumsy at best. Even before the 2010 earthquake, the Caribbean nation of 10 million was struggling with a lack of housing, infrastructure and good governance. The 7.0-magnitude quake, the region's worst in 200 years, killed 300,000 people, left 1.5 million homeless and destroyed 42 public buildings. Since then, the country has been hit with a cholera outbreak, blamed on poor sanitation by <span class="companylink">United Nations</span> troops, as well as Hurricane Sandy. The recovery is expected to take more than 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fantino, a former Toronto police chief, clearly had unrealistic expectations about the state of reconstruction when he visited the poorest country in the Americas in November. He even complained about the poor garbage service. “It is a very difficult country to work in. There is government corruption, and physical and institutional limitations,” observes Carlo Dade, a fellow at the University of Ottawa. “But not giving aid is not an option.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Haitian government has appealed to Canada to work directly with the government, instead of channelling aid through <span class="companylink">the United Nations</span> and international non-governmental organizations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Haiti is not rich in natural resources and has little tourism to speak of, it does have a relatively low crime rate and a homogeneous society. Its potential lies in its people, and they are for the most part industrious and creative. Education is the key to progress, and Canada funds everything from school lunches to training for midwives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fantino is right to expect better leadership. However, the path to long-term success lies in better aid delivery, as well as a more robust private sector – not on threats to stop all funding.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lost this week, somewhere between the heartfelt and perhaps premature obituaries for the Waldorf Hotel, the corresponding and predictable stream of vitriol aimed at Vancouver condominium developers, and the last-minute ticket rush for the Gluten Free Expo, was the biggest news story of the week: Gary Bettman said he's sorry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After announcing that team owners had ratified a tentative deal, the NHL commissioner apologized to fans for the truncated hockey season.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I know that an explanation or an apology will not erase the hard feelings that have built up over the past few months, but I owe you an apology nevertheless,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even I felt a little pang of “finally” when Mr. Bettman acknowledged that, for real <span class="companylink">NHL</span> hockey fans, the three-month-long delay to the start of the season has been a hardship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will the league do anything to make it up to those fans? So far, Mr. Bettman hasn't said. I've heard demands for reduced ticket prices, free cable packages so fans can watch games they would otherwise have to pay for, and even free beer at Canucks games, which I have hunch might be a bad idea. I'm guessing that, right now, league executives are huddled in a room blue-skying some sort of no-cost “fan appreciation” option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Individual teams have offered free merchandise to people who attend the first few games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is more than one <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page devoted to revenge against the league. One of the most popular is called Just Drop It, which now has more than 23,000 followers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top of the page reads, “By clicking ‘like,' I pledge that for every game you take from me after December 21st, 2012, I will boycott you for the equivalent number of games after the lockout ends.” About half of the people who have clicked the pledge are fans of the <span class="companylink">Montreal Canadiens</span>, but plenty of Canucks fans have also given it the <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> thumbs-up. Will that mean empty arenas on opening night? I very much doubt it, especially here in Vancouver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hockey fans aren't like regular people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wording of the Just Drop It pledge tells me that. These are people who believe something has been stolen from them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, they'll get over it. They'll forgive or forget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rogers Arena will sell out for every game of the shortened season – just as it has, the Canucks claim, for every game since 2002. The waiting list for season tickets will grow and people will gladly pay the $150 non-refundable deposit for the privilege of getting into line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If history repeats itself, the Canucks will underperform or choke when the pressure is on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fans will forgive that too. This is hockey. They're our team. We are all Canucks. We'll get 'em next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may be clear by now that I don't much care for hockey. I never have. I'll pay attention during the playoffs, because, as a Vancouverite, if I don't, people assume I'm some sort of Taliban sympathizer, or worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even as a casual observer, I am at a loss to explain the unwavering devotion to a team that, in four decades of play, has failed to win a Stanley Cup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, night after night, year after year, the crowds come, filling the arena's 18,000-plus seats, overpaying for everything (relative to say, reality) and snapping up authentic, league-approved jerseys, t-shirts, and ball caps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, as the Waldorf Hotel eulogies hit fever pitch on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, and the skinny-jeans set was in full froth over anyone who dared question the business plan of the dedicated and creative staff who ran the place, Mike Klassen, a former NPA city council candidate and co-founder of the website City Caucus, posed the question: “When were you there last?” Whoa. Uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From there, the conversation became a tangled lament for all of the cool places that have closed in the city. The consensus was that evil condo developers are to blame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even free-standing autonomous outfits under no threat of eviction have been forced to close because they can't pay their bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the ones who are still in business but struggling, I suggest bolting your doors for three months. Just say you're negotiating. Offer a substandard product and charge more money for tickets. Mark up your draft beer by, say, a thousand per cent. Plaster advertising over every visible surface. Begin each show with strobe lights and U2's Where the Streets Have No Name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And sign that drummer to a 12-year, $64-million contract. He's totally worth it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">History shows the public will become slavishly devoted to you and forgive you, even on the nights that drummer fails to show up.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News that a joint expedition by the Discovery Channel, Japanese public broadcaster NHK and Japan's National Museum of Nature and Science successfully filmed a giant squid in its natural habitat for the first time hit the reclusive giant-squid community hard.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're at close to a million hits on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> in five days,” Duncan the Giant Squid said at a hastily called meeting of concerned squid citizens, a video of which, with accompanying notes, fell into my hands courtesy of an anonymous colossal-squid source. “We're hemorrhaging enigma.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Who let this happen?” said Clyde the Giant Squid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That idiot Lawrence the Giant Squid,” sighed Duncan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The pianist?” said Clyde.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“No, that punk who's missing two of his tentacles. He was out there cavorting in front of a mini-submarine.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Cavorting?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Yes, cavorting. This is a public-relations disaster. If we weren't so overexposed already, I'd say it was time for another squid corpse to wash up on the shores of Newfoundland – 330 pounds of idiot Lawrence.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He's got nice eyes. How big would you say his eyes are?” asked Clyde, opening his as wide as they could go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Gotta be 12 inches, but he's an idiot. Who gets that close to an expedition like that? Call me cynical,” said Duncan, “but I see any kind of Japanese oceanic-research vessel and I just assume it docks at a kitchen.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Maybe we should just go with this, embrace the exposure,” suggested Madeleine the Giant Squid, a successful sea-life-marketing consultant. “We could unite as a species, try rebranding – maybe go with the playful, dolphin-like angle. Act all intelligent and leap around for tourists near resort hotels. Squeak. Can either of you guys squeak?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“No. Besides, octopi have the highly intelligent, multi-armed, endearing invertebrate market cornered. What giant squids had was mystery. We were part legend. We were the Kraken,” said Duncan wearily “You take away our mysterious-deep-sea-creature angle and we're just a somewhat freaky-looking big animal. And even then we're always going to be smaller than most whales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We don't even have cute. Humans love things with big eyes, but not when one eye is bigger than their little heads. Let's face it, no one sees hundreds of subspherical suckers and melts inside.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And always the colossal squid threatening our mind share,” added Madeleine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I hate the colossal squid,” said Clyde. “How big would you say their eyes are?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Pretty big,” said Madeleine. “I gotta say, pretty big. You sure you can't squeak? Also, idea, guys: Let's start calling each other ‘squidizens.'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Give it up, Madeleine,” sighed Duncan. “Look at us. Listen to us. We're too unpleasant to ever be lovable and no one even knows much about our mating habits yet. Just wait till those hit Reddit.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Yikes!” said Madeleine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I know I'm not the only one here who makes a much better unconfirmed sighting than I do a dinner companion,” continued Duncan. “We've created a demand for our presence the only way we could, by almost never being present, by flirting with presence, and now we're a one-hour special on the Discovery Channel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Time was, bored on a Sunday, we'd just pop up in front of a ship and wave our tentacles about a bit. Keep them interested, scoot away. Sometimes we'd take bets on how long a ship would have had to have been at sea before some desperately lonely sailors would mistake a 43-foot cephalopod swishing its massive tentacles and batting its 10-inch eyes at them for a mermaid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Do that nowadays and boom! You're a GIF – a mystique-draining genre if ever there was one.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My tell-all memoir, Go Ask Architeuthis, is going to be ruined if people find out I mostly just swim around and eat smaller sea life,” sighed Clyde. “Seriously, someone needs to talk to Lawrence. Is it too much to ask that one be born, live and then die without causing the words ‘once noble' to be added before the name of your species?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was all set to become the Cormac McCarthy of the deep sea,” said Duncan. “I'm refusing all interviews. I have eight arms and two tentacles, and not one of those appendages is capable of typing quotation marks. It was the perfect gig for me. My publicist is going to hit the roof.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Your publicist is a shark,” said Madeleine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I know, but they're very hard workers. Hey, wait a second! Is that a colossal squid?”</p>

Twenty American children sitting in school have just been shredded like soldiers in foxholes by bullets from a military-style assault weapon. President Obama needs to do everything he can to rally Americans and their elected representatives behind a ban on these ridiculous killing machines. If the protection of small children from lethal gunfire is not sufficient cause for Mr. Obama to spend his leadership capital, what is?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vice-President Joseph Biden caught the moment well: “There is nothing that has pricked the consciousness of the American people . . . more than the image people have of little six-year-old kids riddled – not shot, but riddled, riddled – with bullet holes in their classroom.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no telling when another moment like this one will come along on gun control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No country should take half measures after its children are mowed down, as they were in Newtown, Conn., last month, when a homicidal 20-year-old nearly ran out of bodies to shoot before he ran out of bullets. Some bodies had 11 bullets in them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No country should wait to act – as the U.S. waited – after a movie-theatre massacre of young people in Colorado last summer, again featuring an assault weapon in a starring role. On an audiotape, 20 shots are heard in about 20 seconds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The right to bear arms does not imply the right to drive a tank down Main Street. Who needs such guns? People who wish to riddle others with bullets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Rifle Association says, “Our leaders do not believe that their legal choices of firearms should be dictated by a homicidal maniac in Connecticut.” This is a moment to challenge the NRA's hold on the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, Mr. Biden will present Mr. Obama with an agenda for new gun controls. There will be several important measures: background checks on (we hope) all gun buyers; an end (we trust) to the ludicrous restrictions on gun-related research by federal agencies; and lower limits on magazine capacity. Those are good, as far as they go. But Mr. Obama, who cried real tears in public over the children's deaths in Connecticut, now needs to speak forcefully for real change.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For lovers of Inuit art, this was a week of poignant change. The passing of Kenojuak Ashevak in the early hours of Tuesday, at the age of 85, marked the end of an era. She was one of the first of the Inuit artists, born and reared on the land, to enter into the experiment in art making at Cape Dorset, and one of the most talented. Her famous work The Enchanted Owl was replicated on postage stamps in 1970. In 1982, she was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. Two years ago, she played the role of visiting dignitary at the <span class="companylink">Art Gallery of Ontario</span>, when the exhibition Inuit Modern opened. Touring the display in her wheelchair in the company of her nephew Tim Pitsiulak (also a celebrated artist), she smiled as she took in the scope of the creativity unleashed in those early days. As was so often the case, her countenance that day was radiant with astonishment and a kind of elfin glee.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"> While she never expected such success, she enjoyed every bit of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her death led me to think about that encounter at the AGO, and my two subsequent visits to her home in Cape Dorset (a small, cozy space heated to a tropical clime), where she could be found lying on her stomach on a queen-size mattress in her living room, drawing and drawing, making the images that would then be turned into prints over at Kinngait Studios. Her absorption was obvious, as was her industriousness, and the assuredness with which she made a line taut with energy, purpose and vitality. It was this gift that first drew the attention of northern wanderer James Houston more than 50 years ago. Travelling in the Arctic for the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span>, he noticed the appliquéd bags and clothing that Kenojuak and other women in the community were making, recognizing in these objects an extraordinary liveliness of design. He had the idea to transfer that to paper, and Kenojuak, a visionary, turned out to be a natural.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thinking about all this, I made my way Tuesday afternoon through the Toronto traffic to Feheley Fine Arts, where Kenojuak's work has long been shown. I wanted to pay my respects and to share a midwinter whisky in the artist's honour with proprietor Pat Feheley. Together, we looked at her prints again, and rifled through catalogues, remembering. The special treat came, though, when we opened a box of treasures from back in the storage room, a group of objects (not for sale) owned by Seattle collector John Price, an avid acquirer of all things Kenojuak. Here were two early, gamey-smelling sealskin bags designed and stitched and beaded by Kenojuak in her young days, before her career with the white art world had begun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, you can see her rapturous grasp of the natural world, that predisposition toward symmetry in design, and that sense of graphic buoyancy that would never leave her. On the back of one of the bags, she had used contrasting sealskin to create cutout images of women going about their traditional work, and the various accoutrements of camp life, a life she had known at firsthand until middle age. These decorative arrangements, so deftly made, mark the start of something: a woman's handiwork, intended for the intimate pleasure of her family, that engendered a new tradition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenojuak's life was certainly a hard one: birthing seven children; adopting (more or less) seven more; being taken as a young mother against her will to a hospital in Quebec to be treated for tuberculosis for several years, forced to leave her children and husband behind. (Some of her children died in her absence.) It was a series of events that would have defeated all but the most resilient human spirits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet her line kept dancing. This joy is her great legacy, this and her passionate affirmation of the land we are honoured to share, where a cluster of berries, a scrap of lichen or a breathing hole discovered in the ice would once have meant the difference between sustenance and starvation. Her art became emblematic of our hardy modern nation, with ancient roots to be proud of. She helped us to know Canada better.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto in early 2013 finds itself facing a double crisis of governance. The first, of course, is at City Hall, where the mayor is threatened with removal for conflict of interest. The second is at the school board.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a quarter of a million students and nearly 600 schools, the Toronto District School Board is the biggest in Canada and the fourth biggest in North America. It spends about $3-billion a year, a third as much as City Hall. It is a mammoth with a task that is vital to the city's future, and it is in complete disarray.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its education director, Chris Spence, has just resigned in a plagiarism scandal. Its trustees are locked in a bitter power struggle with the provincial Education Ministry. Its teachers are in revolt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The botched handling of Friday's strike threat was sadly typical of the way things are going at the TDSB. Parents of elementary-school children went to bed on Thursday night believing their kids would have a day off. Authorities told them that school was cancelled. They woke up to find that schools were open after all. The labour board had ruled against the strike and the TDSB had flip-flopped. Families across the city scrambled to rearrange their lives, again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is the school board so dysfunctional? A decade ago, the provincial government divested the board of all authority and appointed a supervisor in its place when it failed to balance its budget. Last year, as the board again struggled with money problems, Queen's Park threatened to take over again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under pressure, the board let independent consultants scrutinize its operations. They found out-of-control absenteeism, overbudget building projects, underutilized schools and inefficient maintenance. The board, fearing a threat to its autonomy, bridled at the findings. It was even more offended when the province offered to send in a “special assistance team” to help trustees get it together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final straw for trustees came when the government imposed a renewed contract on skilled-trades workers, as it did for teachers. This week, TDSB chair Chris Bolton fired off an angry letter to Education Minister Laurel Broten that said the move had foreclosed the very reforms to labour practices that the province was demanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The board has a point when it argues that Queen's Park demands spending control from the board while imposing obligations like full-day kindergarten without supplying enough money to pay for them. Still, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that the board is in over its head.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turnout for electing school trustees is low, and some of them have been around for decades. Many seem to see their job as advocating for community interest groups rather than representing the common interest. The board consistently votes against measures, such as closing underused schools or selling off vacant school lands, that might help the system pay its bills but would anger constituents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The size and budget of the TDSB have grown by leaps since municipal amalgamation, leaving an immense, bureaucratic organization with weak leadership and entrenched, self-serving unions. The whole outfit, headquartered in its North York bunker, exudes the scent of rot. It cries out for reform and renewal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In big cities like New York or Chicago, the head of schools is a high-profile position filled by high-calibre individuals. The TDSB needs a chief executive with experience in the business world or the broader public sector at complex administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They have rightly paid the most attention to their education function,” says Ben Levin, a professor at the University of Toronto's Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, “but they are also a very large property management and transportation and human-resources operation and they have to make sure these are managed effectively and efficiently.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As embarrassing and painful as it is for the TDSB, Chris Spence's departure is a golden opportunity to bring better management to Toronto's troubled school system.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you weren't there, it's hard to explain – the all-consuming feeling of sitting by the radio, hour after hour, as the music of the 1960s poured in. Those staticky songs were like messages from a bigger life than the one you were living. Something was happening out there, to everyone at the exact same time, and you were part of it just by listening to it. It was the Bernoulli principle applied to art: Because all music flowed through a single channel, the AM band, that constraint accelerated the force and vibrancy of it. Every week saw the arrival of another immortal song.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the feeling that David Chase – the writer/director who created an immortal television hit of his own, The Sopranos – wanted to evoke with his feature-film directorial debut, Not Fade Away, which opened across Canada last week. Set to the soundtrack of the 1960s, it's the story of Douglas (John Magaro), a New Jersey high-schooler who first alienates and then frees himself from his narrow-minded parents (Molly Price and James Gandolfini, reunited with Chase after his phenomenal success as Tony Soprano) by forming a band, growing his hair and eventually moving across the continent to Los Angeles. It's a story Chase, now 67, knows well, because he lived it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his New Jersey bedrooms (first in Clifton, then in North Caldwell), Chase – he was born David DeCesare – would listen to those songs, stare at those album covers, dream those dreams. In high school, he and some friends formed a band. He started out playing drums, but his parents sold his kit. He played on cardboard boxes for a while, then switched to the bass. “The [strained] relationship between Douglas and his father is autobiographical,” Chase said during an interview in Toronto last month. He was wearing a nice jacket, his thin grey hair framed his slightly fox-like features and his voice (when he used it) was low and gruff. “Some of the stuff with the band, the [competitive] feelings engendered there, are autobiographical.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His band lasted three years before “fizzling out,” Chase says. “And I was a crappy bass player.” He attended the Tisch School of the Arts at <span class="companylink">New York University</span>, then moved to L.A., where he went to <span class="companylink">Stanford University</span>'s film school. “I realized that I could make a film for $1,000, but you can't do anything with that,” he says. “But if I could write a feature screenplay, I might actually sell that, and it would be like having a piece of property.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He changed his name, landed a job writing for the TV series Kolchak: The Night Stalker, then moved onto The Rockford Files (where he won the first of his seven Emmy Awards in 1978) and Northern Exposure before creating The Sopranos in 1999, the show that revolutionized cable and the way we watch television. He married his high-school girlfriend, Denise Kelly, and they had one child, Michele DeCesare, now 31, who played Meadow's friend Hunter on The Sopranos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As a kid, I was always full of yearning,” Chase says. “I was shy, and pretty fearful of things. Then as an adolescent, in order to learn not to be fearful, I became very rebellious and risk-taking. I put myself in positions that were not good – dangerous positions – as an attempt to get out of my shy self.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while it lasted, his band was “such fun,” Chase continues. “It was so great being part of this thing where you all spoke the same language. You liked the same things, and you could talk about them forever. Mostly you could just sit there and listen to that music, over and over again, and notice things about it, and point out little features of it. It was like an avocation, like it was work, but it was really great.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That burst of information occurred near the end of our 15-minute interview, and it was the most animated I'd see Chase. When I arrived, he was lying on a sofa with his eyes closed, miserable with a head cold. “Taciturn” would be a generous word for his conversation style, but I don't think it was some kind of dickish power trip; I think he is a genuinely reticent talker who saves it for the page. The first sound captured on my tape recorder is him yawning, and the bulk of our meeting consists of me positing ideas, and him agreeing or disagreeing with them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both his parents are dead, and he “absolutely” does not mind everyone knowing he had a difficult relationship with them that was never really reconciled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My father got sick like Gandolfini's character [in Not Fade Away],” Chase says. “He was in the hospital in New York, and I went home to see him. By that time he was proudly telling all his nurses that his son, the producer of The Rockford Files, was coming. But in my presence he didn't do that. He couldn't give me that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chase's mother was worse. “My father understood me a little bit,” he says. “I think he got a little bit of the idea of wanting to make a statement, or be in show business, do something creative. My mother never got it, at all. She just bitched about it all the time.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Chase wanted revenge, he got it creatively: Both Tony's mother in The Sopranos and Douglas's mother in Not Fade Away are terrifying creations: cold, complaining, unsatisfiable. “Selfish,” Chase says. “Selfish women.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Who don't want anyone else to be happy either. Who create an aura of misery,” I add.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You got it. You called it,” Chase says. “You called it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His defence was “to stay out of the house as much as I could, be out late at night, and not listen to her. Over time I lost respect for her.” It was also an impetus for his leaving home, and immersing himself in work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His monster success with The Sopranos let him make Not Fade Away the way he wanted, with a largely unknown cast and an unconventional, meandering structure. But in Hollywood, how long does the good will from a hit last? “I'm about to find out,” Chase replies dryly. “I'll let you know. I always thought that was part of the job, to make your movie different from every other movie. But apparently it isn't. It seems what's wanted is a very narrow band.” Still, Chase plans to stick to features or telefilms: “I would never do a weekly series again. I did it for so long. I've done it. If that's all there was, I would retire.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not Fade Away ends as Chase's real life began: Douglas is in L.A., “a place that's so different from where he's from, and he really doesn't have anything,” Chase says. “But he's got himself, and he's got music.” For Douglas's doppelganger, that was more than enough.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1969, the recently elected government of Pierre Trudeau published a white paper on Indian policy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consistent with Mr. Trudeau's belief in individual but not collective rights, and reflective of the frustration about the lack of progress on aboriginal matters, the white paper recommended scrapping the Indian Act (which was what Indians said they wanted); delivering services through the same programs as for other Canadians; abolishing the Indian affairs special programs; and transferring Indian lands to Indian people and away from ownership by reserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aboriginal leaders furiously denounced the white paper as a recipe for assimilation. They said it rejected their special standing in Canada as the original occupiers of the land. They insisted it diluted their relationship with the Crown that dated to the Royal Proclamation of 1763.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trudeau relented, not something he often did. Ever since, without much success, Indian leaders and governments have tried to develop a functional, “nation-to-nation” relationship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was always going to be a struggle. Not only did generations of mistrust corrode confidence, but it proved difficult to figure out how to give effect in fact, as opposed to rhetoric, to the “self-determination” of aboriginal nations that contained 612 bands (according to Statistics Canada's survey of 2006), on more than 2,600 reserves, many in remote areas with small land bases and populations that measured in the hundreds or few thousands of people – to say nothing of the fact that about half the Indian population had left the reserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Efforts to square this circle have rather predictably failed. Aboriginals, of course, place the entire blame on governments. The reality is, as one would expect, rather more complicated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1992, a major effort to start serious treaty negotiations began in British Columbia, where only a small amount of territory is covered by treaties. With great fanfare, governments and the B.C. aboriginal leadership launched the B.C. Treaty Commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two decades later, the results are depressingly modest. By provincial statistics, 60 Indian groups are negotiating, representing only about half the provincial total. The rest are not interested in participating. Only two groups have implemented treaties, three have completed final agreements, two more have advanced final agreements and one has an agreement in principle. (The Nisga'a Treaty preceded the post-1992 process.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year earlier, the federal government had created a royal commission. It took the better part of five years and went way over budget, but eventually produced five volumes. It tried to articulate a vision of a “nation-to-nation” relationship with an elaborate third order of government, an aboriginal parliament, regrouping (or aggregating) bands into larger units, new treaties, more land, a bigger share of resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there was too much castle-in-the-sky thinking (which is why former Saskatchewan premier Allan Blakeney quit the commission), too much dreamy talk of how to create economic wealth for aboriginals, and an analysis that rested far too much on the separateness of aboriginals rather than what they had in common with other Canadians. Few concrete changes occurred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime minister Brian Mulroney's government negotiated with the provinces and the aboriginal leadership a historic document – the Charlottetown Accord – that would have greatly expanded constitutional protections for aboriginal rights. The then-head of the <span class="companylink">Assembly of First Nations</span>, Ovide Mercredi, campaigned tirelessly for the accord. Alas for him, a majority of aboriginals voted against it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, as now, many aboriginals do not believe governments negotiate in good faith, and governments struggle to understand aboriginals' bottom lines. It is a recipe for slow progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been other false starts: the Kelowna Accord from the Paul Martin government that would have greatly increased federal monies for aboriginal education and housing was dropped by the Harper government. Aboriginals decry the Indian Act but efforts to change it largely go nowhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So yesterday, another meeting occurred, surrounded by controversy and fiery rhetoric, threats to bring the nation's economy to a halt, a meeting cobbled together quickly, with a shifting agenda and the likelihood of sustained progress almost nil, given past failures.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Threats by native leaders to escalate blockades that would disrupt commercial activity could soon force a showdown of a different sort in Canada: one involving police, the judiciary and the federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It hasn't just been aboriginal protesters who have recently been ignoring orders of the court – it's been law enforcement organizations as well. And their decision not to carry out rulings from the bench has prompted some judges to issue strong warnings about where this intransigence could ultimately lead.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest is Ontario Superior Court Judge David Brown. In December, the judge issued an injunction to end what was deemed an illegal native blockade of a rail line near Sarnia. Local police not only disregarded the order but instructed officers to not even attend the protest lines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, the judge had also granted an emergency injunction to end an Idle No More-related blockade of a CN main line between Toronto and Montreal. This time it was the Ontario Provincial Police that flouted the judge's directions because it deemed the situation created by 15 protesters to be too dangerous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, that blockade ended, but not because of any actions of the police.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the judge accepted that police agencies have to have some leeway about when and how they go about enforcing any ruling, “they cannot,” he said, “ignore judicial orders under the guise of contemplating how best to use their tactical discretion. Such an approach would have the practical effect of neutering court orders.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that instance he was speaking about the Sarnia blockade which stayed up until earlier this month when police, thanks to pressure brought to bear by yet another court order, finally enforced the injunction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the decisions of the OPP, the judge said: “That kind of passivity by the police leads me to doubt that a future exists in this province for the use of court injunctions in cases of public demonstrations.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judge Brown's frustration echoed that of B.C. Supreme Court Judge Mark McEwan last spring. In that case, Justice McEwan was so angry with the RCMP's unwillingness to administer his orders to end an aboriginal blockade in the northern part of the province he compared the situation to one of the most infamous native standoffs in recent memory – Caledonia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justice McEwan asked lawyers in the case if they understood how “demoralizing and undermining to the whole idea of the rule of law it is to have people carry on in a community flagrantly in violation of both the Criminal Code and a court law – a court order.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both these judges are right, of course. When the police decide to stuff court orders in their back pockets and do nothing about them, we have a problem. In fact, we have a problem when innocent third parties such as railway companies are forced to go to court to get relief from the patently illegal action of a small group of activists. Why does it take an injunction? Whatever happened to telling people to move or they'll be arrested? And since when did 15 people blocking a railway line present a situation that is “too dangerous” for police intervention?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Justice McEwan remarked: policing in Canada is in a dire condition if a court order to end an occupation can't be carried out because of a small group of protesters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As concerning as the police tactics themselves are, the manner in which they might be interpreted is equally alarming. It is a generally understood and accepted tenet of our criminal justice system that no one stands above the law. Any perception that one group is being allowed to creates broader concerns. As Judge Brown said: “Without Canadians sharing a public expectation of obeying the law, the rule of law will shatter.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Police doubtlessly believe that these protests, given enough time, will fizzle out on their own. They are also likely concerned about the optics of going in and removing protesters, especially if there is resistance and things get ugly. That's understandable. But generally, Canadians will always side with those trying to enforce our laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If native leaders initiate further blockades, especially ones that disrupt the commercial lifeblood of our country, the federal government will have to insist the RCMP and other police forces in Canada begin doing their job. Idle No More could take on a completely new meaning.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a lot of strange sights in Ufa, Russia – homemade plywood shovels digging out BMWs, handgun kiosks in the mall, runway fashion on unplowed streets – but the strangest of all might have been the appearance of Brian Burke, high in the corner stands behind the cheerleaders, leprechaun hats and thundersticks.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tie draped about his shoulders like a thin shawl, arms folded over chest, the then general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs sat like an old Politburo member proudly watching a May Day military march.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had reason to be proud. USA Hockey, of which he has been an integral force for years, was putting on a show. Gaining strength with every game, humiliating the Canadians 5-1 and then defeating favourite Sweden in the gold-medal game, Team USA had just won its second world junior championship in four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burke was pumped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was happy for the American youngsters and, he said, “excited” about the prospects of the NHL lockout ending and his Maple Leafs getting back to proving he knows what he is doing in Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's been a bunch of changes,” he said. “It will be Randy Carlyle's first season behind the bench. We've added James van Riemsdyk. We're going to work hard and make the playoffs.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He made it sound so good. He was one of the few senior hockey executives to make the arduous trip to Ufa to check out his team's prospects. He liked what he saw in young Morgan Rielly, the attacking defenceman of the Moose Jaw Warriors who played for Canada. He was delighted with the aggressive play of Tyler Biggs, the Oshawa Generals' forward who won gold with the Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Really, really excited,” Burke said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three days later, he was really, really crushed, stunned by being fired as Leafs GM before the puck could even drop on a season that might have been the measure of Brian Burke, had not his new bosses decided a pre-emptive strike was in order.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had been in charge of hockey's only $1-billion club for four years. The Maple Leafs had not made the playoffs in that time but were supposedly rebuilding from many more years of bad decisions and a Stanley Cup drought that dates to black-and-white television.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had been GM of the Hartford Whalers, <span class="companylink">Vancouver Canucks</span> and <span class="companylink">Anaheim Ducks</span>, with whom he had won a Cup in 2007. This, however, was his first firing – and friends say it was devastating and unexpected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New ownership had also let him go in Vancouver by simply refusing to renew his contract. New ownership is like that in hockey: Very successful men in other fields become owners and find, for perhaps the first time, they are recognized and quoted and, being successful in previous enterprises, instantly decide they are experts in their new one. It is a familiar story and often a harmful one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General managers in sport prefer to maintain control, to keep their own counsel. Perhaps the new owners of the team's parent company, Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd., didn't feel they were privy enough to Burke's master plan. Perhaps they didn't feel he respected them enough as hockey people. After all, they owned the team; they must know something.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't as if he was unaware of criticism. Running hockey in Toronto is more scrutinized than running the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was the trade that brought Phil Kessel and his goals to Toronto but gave the <span class="companylink">Boston Bruins</span> a brilliant future in the likes of, so far, top draft picks Tyler Seguin and Dougie Hamilton. There was the contract extension and subsequent firing of head coach and friend Ron Wilson. But there is also van Riemsdyk and perhaps Carlyle and the unknown promise of the various prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friends who have talked to Burke say that he was caught 100-per-cent off-guard. He told one that on his way to meeting his new bosses, he thought something had gone wrong with one of his staff – he had some crazy idea that someone had been arrested for drunk driving – and all the way back to the office he was going through his list of close employees, worrying about them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It never once occurred to him that it might involve him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fired, but hardly killed, the 57-year-old Burke accepted his fate, for the time being. He would serve as a senior adviser to new GM David Nonis, who is ironically a Burke creation from their Canucks days together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He would stay in Toronto, cheer for the Leafs – and he would meet with the puzzled and polarized Toronto media Saturday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was in his first press conference that he used his oft-quoted phrase calling for “pugnacity, testosterone, truculence and belligerence” in his team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He still believes in it, even if in some ways it cost him his job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it will likely bring him his next one.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question / It's easy to find pubs in London but I always get the feeling there are some hidden gems I'm missing. What are the locals' favourite locals?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you can't find a pub in London, you're probably still in your hotel room. But not all the city's estimated 7,000 boozers are worth raising a glass to: for every hearth-warmed tavern clinking with dimpled flagons, there are many more with surly service, dodgy dinners or guidebook-wielding tourists loudly planning their Tower of London visits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by following the thirsty locals to their favoured off-the-beaten-path haunts, you can bypass these so-so pubs. These are the kind of cozy, ale-infused joints that you'll want to stick around in all evening – unless it's karaoke night, in which case a bar crawl may be in order.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A good landlord treats the pub as an extension of his welcoming personality, and a good pub feels like a home from home – the greatest thing is atmosphere,” says London-based author and beer expert Pete Brown, whose latest tome – Shakespeare's Local: Six Centuries of History Seen Through One Extraordinary Pub – illuminates Southwark's medieval George Inn through the stories of those who've supped there, including the Bard himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brown, who also writes at petebrown.blogspot.ca, recommends the George to pub-loving visitors alongside other favourites such as the Southampton Arms in Kentish Town – “There's a sign outside saying ‘Beer, Cider, Meat' and that's what they do” – and the Salisbury on St Martin's Lane: “possibly the best preserved example of the beautiful gin palaces built in London in the late-Victorian era.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these are not his only faves. For pub crawlers who like to keep moving, he also suggests Soho's Coach and Horses, Euston Station's tiny Euston Tap and the smashing Lamb on Lamb Conduit Street. It still has “snob screens,” which Victorian drinkers would angle so they wouldn't have to look at their fellow imbibers at the bar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the most compact crawls, Brown suggests avoiding clamorous areas such as Oxford Street, where the pub quality is hit-and-miss, and sticking to the Clerkenwell and Southwark neighbourhoods. Both have been teeming with pubs for centuries – “I don't think I've ever found a bad one there,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a tavern enthusiast myself, I'd add a couple of my own to Brown's list of London hot spots: Clerkenwell's charming Jerusalem Tavern; Holborn's backstreet Ye Olde Mitre – look for the alleyway entrance on Hatton Garden; and Islington's Old Red Lion, which combines a traditional bar downstairs with an upstairs studio theatre (I saw an explosive production of The Revenger's Tragedy there recently).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beer aficionados should also hit one of the pubs in the Craft Beer Company mini-chain – the Leather Lane one is recommended – for some taste-bud-popping microbrews. If you're lucky, there will be a tipple or two from wildly popular new London beermakers such as Kernel Brewery and Camden Town Brewery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Booze and history still sup together in many London areas, of course. For a taste, head to Fuller's Griffin Brewery in West London. Beer has been made on this site for centuries and you can take a tour (book it at fullers.co.uk) that concludes with some generous samples – Chiswick Bitter is my favourite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Britain's national drink is cask ale, also known as real ale,” says Brown, with the gravitas of a man who has tried more than a few just to make sure. “It's not for everyone but there's a huge variety, so don't be put off if you don't like the first one you try. Don't be afraid to ask for a sample before you buy. If the pub refuses – I've never been refused – it's not worth drinking in.”</p>

The thinly sliced tempeh (soy protein) gives the sandwich a satisfying chewy texture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with its thick grilled rye bread drenched in tahini maple vinaigrette and gooey Swiss cheese oozing out the sides (vegans can substitute walnut cheese), it's probably not the lowest-calorie choice for vegetarians watching their waistlines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's okay by me. I'm sure many vegans don't mind indulging occasionally. Heirloom's got them covered with all sorts of sweets, rich nut creams and deep-fried treats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avocado frites (vegan and gluten-free) are a revelation. The peeled wedges are dredged in cornmeal flour and sweet paprika then flash fried to give the coating a light golden crisp without melting the buttery flesh. The textural contrast is awesome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're in the mood for something lighter, Heirloom offers many interesting salads, especially at lunch. Seema, a fair-weather vegan, loved her warm barley with frisee lettuce and soft-poached pairs. (I thought the Dijon vinaigrette could have been better balanced. When mixed with the pickled crimini mushrooms, it made for a puckering, acidic mouthful.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't inexpensive. Then again, South Granville is an expensive neighbourhood. The above salad was $16, or $20 with soup. I don't mind paying for premium ingredients, which Heirloom certainly does use. But I was a surprised when, at the end of the meal, the handheld debit machine prompted an automatic 18 per cent tip. That seems a bit bold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Heirloom opened in October, the menu was tapas-style, offering small plates for sharing. Ms. Morley has since added more substantial entrees to the dinner menu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Butter chickpea curry is one of the new dishes. The chickpeas were the perfect consistency – firm on the outside, creamy on the inside. Sundried apricot chutney had a marvelous meaty depth of flavour. But the tomato cashew cream could have used a few more shakes of the kitchen's house-made garam masala.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The curry paled next Cuban black bean chili, stewed thick and hearty with multidimensional pops of cocoa, espresso and toasted cumin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Desserts aren't the kitchen's greatest strength. Especially not the chocolate cake (moist and earthy) with its not-so-sweetly poached beets. More cane sugar, please.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the bar is a standout. The head bartender, a holistic nutritionist, mixes some highly inventive cocktails. She infuses vodka with cedar tips, adds hibiscus to tequila and shakes E3Live blue-green algae with Victoria Gin and honey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heirloom inherited a late-night licence from Primo and is open until 1 a.m. One side of the room is filled with high-top tables. It's a serious bar that gets fairly crowded in the evening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We want it to be the best vegetarian restaurant that you ever got drunk at,” Mr. Johl told a reporter from Scout magazine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if its customers don't all get smashed, Heirloom is certainly doing a fine job of shattering old stereotypes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three hundred and sixty-five years ago, a group of prominent Europeans gathered in the city of Munster and invented something that would change history: the modern nation.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Peace of Westphalia created a set of institutions that reshaped the world: national self-determination, exclusive sovereignty of governments over agreed-upon territory, fixed borders and the citizenship rights of people living within those borders. But this new invention failed to take into account groups of people who had lived in the same territory, often longer than the Europeans, but did not necessarily see themselves as members of the Westphalian nation: the indigenous tribal and nomadic peoples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That omission is behind some of the most painful political confrontations of our age. The Sami, Roma, Sinti, Pavee, Bedouin, Bushmen, Nenets, Innu, and the numerous native bands of North America have lived in a marginal, sometimes deadly relationship with the modern state from the outset. These groups often recognize themselves as “nations” – in Canada, the term “first nations” has been widely used, accurately, to describe non-Innu indigenous groups since the 1980s – but the nature of that nationhood has not been fully defined in a mutually agreeable way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This question is at the root of the new wave of activism, centred around the Idle No More protests. The uniting factor is a desire for a new relationship between Canada and the indigenous nations within its borders. While there's a lot of disagreement about what this means, there's near-unanimous consensus that the current, paternal, federally-run system does nobody any good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make such a relationship work, we will need to define what an indigenous nation really is, and how it works. This year is the 400th anniversary of the first attempt: the Two-Row Wampum Treaty of 1613, which predates the birth of the Westphalian state by half a century. Its distinct purple and white beads declared, visually, that the Iroquois nations and the European colonial government were parallel, equal, independent, and not to interfere with one another's paths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such treaties, including the Royal Proclamation of 1763, established that bands have some features of modern nations: control over their agreed-upon territory and its resources, de facto citizenship and the right to govern themselves. For 40 years, Canadian courts have recognized these treaties (and land claims yet to be settled) as legally binding; they became part of the Constitution in 1982.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means that there is no question indigenous peoples have a right to be self-determined nations. But what kind of nation? A full-fledged Westphalian state? An ethno-territorial nation like Scotland and Wales in Britain, or Quebec in Canada? Or some less concrete form of nation built on traditions?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One problem is that those treaties, while allowing independence, also all but guarantee dependence, because they obligate the Canadian state to provide compensation and services. One promising thing about this new protest movement is that it's aimed in part against band councils and their relationship with Ottawa, in hopes of putting independence in the foreground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That points to another pitfall. Whatever form it takes, an indigenous nation will generally be what is known as a rentier state: its degree of independence hinges on the extent to which it can extract natural-resource and property rents from its land, as well as grants from outside. So environmentalists who have joined this movement in hopes that sovereign native bands will be better ecological stewards than Ottawa may be disappointed: The most independent and successful post-Indian Act nations could well resemble other post-colonial states with natural resources. The Innu of Greenland, for example, have concluded that their independence from Denmark can best be achieved through aggressive deep-sea oil drilling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite these paradoxes, there is a workable path to autonomy. It was recognized by the 1983 Commons special committee on aboriginal self-government and the 1996 Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples: a new order of government, parallel to the provinces and Ottawa, run by indigenous peoples on land they legally own and control. After 400 years of ambiguity, this would allow these nations-within-nations to decide what they are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday, January 15, 2013</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A column published Saturday should have used the term “Inuit” – which refers to the indigenous peoples of northern North America and Greenland – rather than “Innu,” which describes a native band located in southeastern Quebec and Labrador.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key to ending the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> lockout slipped into place at 2 a.m. last last Sunday, when Phoenix Coyotes captain Shane Doan sat down with NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly and Bob Batterman, the league's outside counsel and chief labour strategist, in a board room at the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s headquarters in New York.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twelve and a half hours earlier, the owners and players resumed face-to-face negotiations under the encouragement of U.S. federal mediator Scot Beckenbaugh. But there was still almost no progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and the owners remained adamant the salary cap in the second year of a new collective agreement could not be more than $60-million (all currency U.S.).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This reflected the 50-50 split in league revenue the players and owners agreed to months earlier. But the players wanted a more gradual move to the lower salary cap and were holding out for $64.3-million, the same as the 2011-12 cap, after starting at $70-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other major issue for the owners was the variance in salary from year-to-year in multiyear contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of their war against the front-loaded contracts that lessened the effect of the salary cap, the owners wanted to limit the difference in annual compensation to no more than 35 per cent from one year to the next and one year's salary could not be any less than 50 per cent of the highest year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time Doan sat down with Daly and Batterman, the owners had grudgingly raised their offer to $62.5-million, less than $2-million away from the players.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a tiny gap to be sure but neither side was willing to budge. Also in the room were players George Parros and Ron Hainsey and four NHLPA staffers including special counsel Steve Fehr. Daly and Batterman were flanked by a couple more <span class="companylink">NHL</span> lawyers. It looked as if the negotiations would stall. But one hour later, after Doan explained why the players could not move from their number, his sincerity won over Daly and Batterman. It was the key breakthrough and the remaining major issues were worked through in a couple of hours. By 5 a.m., the players and owners had a tentative agreement on a new labour deal. The 113-day lockout was over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What follows is a timeline of the major events that led to the agreement, including how Doan was able to persuade the hard-nosed <span class="companylink">NHL</span> negotiators this was about more than money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday, Jan. 2, 6 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 30 members of the <span class="companylink">NHL Players' Association</span>'s executive committee took part in a conference call with NHLPA executive director Donald Fehr, his brother Steve and the non-playing members of the negotiating team. They were to decide if the union would use its disclaimer of interest, granted in a vote by the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s 740 players, against the owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This gave the NHLPA the right to notify the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> it intended to dissolve, which would clear the way for an anti-trust lawsuit against the owners in a bid to end the lockout. The deadline to use the disclaimer was midnight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The players reviewed the legal advice they were given about the disclaimer. Their lawyers said even if they did not use the disclaimer by midnight, and had to take another player vote to get another disclaimer to use several days later, it would not affect their chances in court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decision was made to use the disclaimer if it became apparent the owners were not moving in the negotiations. The call on using it was left solely up to Donald Fehr because talks were expected to go up to and past the deadline, leaving no time for consulting the 30-man executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday, Jan. 2, 8 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The full negotiating teams met at the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>'s head office. As was the practice in these negotiations, one side presented the other with a new proposal. This time it was the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>, which handed over a new summary and a new version of the 288-page offer it made late the previous week, the one that re-started the negotiations after they broke off Dec. 13.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in that summary and offer were some changes in the language concerning punishment for teams that failed to report hockey-related revenue (HRR). The changes would lead to a day of nasty exchanges through the media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beckenbaugh was also back in the talks at the invitation of both sides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday, Jan. 2, 11:30 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fehr made a quick consultation with the players taking part in the negotiations, Doan, Hainsey, Parros, Brad Boyes, Craig Adams, Chris Campoli, Mathieu Darche, Rick DiPietro, Andrew Ference, Martin St. Louis and Kevin Westgarth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They agreed negotiations, although slow, were moving enough to refrain from issuing the disclaimer to Bettman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the owners no longer faced the threat of an anti-trust suit, negotiations broke down. The owners would not budge from their demand of a $60-million salary cap in the second year and salary variance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one point, Bettman angered the players by talking about how teams would gladly unload players if they had to have a $64.3-million cap. By 12:30 a.m. Thursday both sides called it quits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donald Fehr and Bettman walked into the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> cafeteria that served as a makeshift media room. Fehr was the first to speak to the reporters and seemed dispirited while Bettman was a little upbeat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Usually, it was the other way around. Neither man told the reporters talks had broken off and Beckenbaugh was asked to come back and see if he could get things moving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday, Jan. 3, 10 a.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By this time, the players let it be known to reporters there was a problem with the HRR language. There was no longer any mention of sanctions for teams trying to evade reporting all of their HRR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accusations were made through favoured reporters by both sides, although no harsh words were exchanged face-to-face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the afternoon, Beckenbaugh sorted out the dispute and the original language was restored to the document. But it damaged the already woeful lack of trust between the sides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There would be no full negotiating sessions for the next two days, just smaller meetings between the mediator and various committees for each side. Beckenbaugh provided the only action, giving bored television camera operators something to shoot as he walked the four blocks back and forth from the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> offices to the union's hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saturday, Jan. 5, 1:30 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The painfully slow group meetings produced enough progress, if that is the right word, that Beckenbaugh decided they should resume meeting face-to-face. But there were still no sessions with the full negotiating teams from each side, with Bettman and Fehr in the room together, nor would there be for the rest of the 16-hour session that resulted in the agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunday, Jan. 6, 2 a.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time Doan sat down for the key meeting, the owners had increased their offer for a second-year salary cap to $62.5-million but swore they could go no further. The players were just as resolute at $64.3-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Doan went to work. He told Daly and Batterman it was not about the money. The players already knew that even at $64.3-million their contracts, signed when they received 57 per cent of HRR rather than 50, would be clipped by escrow payments in the cap system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather, it was about family. A difference of less than $2-million in a 2013-14 salary cap may not seem like much but $1.8-million multiplied by 30 teams was $54-million. In a league where the median salary is $1.4-million, which means 370 of 740 players earn that much or less, that $54-million remaining available for teams to spend means a lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would mean, Doan said, teams could re-sign more players. That means fewer families disrupted by moves to another city. If even two players per team could be saved, that would be 60 families left undisturbed. It was a huge issue for the players.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within an hour, Daly and Batterman were convinced. They agreed on behalf of the owners to a cap of $64.3-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since both sides already had a good idea where each stood on the other issues – salary variance, term limits on contracts, the length of a collective agreement and player pensions – over the next two hours they were settled. By 5:30 a.m., Fehr and Bettman appeared together before the media to announce an agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The players felt Doan did important work but they thought something else just as important was at work. There was a feeling Bettman was under increasing pressure from some owners, sponsors and the NBC television network to make sure the season was not lost. By the early hours of Jan. 6, the players thought, Bettman and the owners felt they were running out of time to get a deal to save a 48-game season, so they decided to move.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've been trying to decide which master satirist I'd like to resurrect to explore the madness of the gun-control debate. Kurt Vonnegut, maybe? Or Billy Wilder? I'm not sure either one of them would relish the challenge of this particular theatre of the absurd. “No one would believe it,” they'd sigh and escape back to their peaceful rests.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not sure I'm up to the task either, because this week has clearly been sponsored by Planet Crazy. Where even to begin? Perhaps with U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden's press conference on gun control, where he was talking about the bodies of six-year-old Sandy Hook students “riddled” with bullets, when CNN interrupted … to bring us news of another school shooting. We also had the National Rifle Association boasting that it's signed up 100,000 new members since Sandy Hook, which probably marks the first time in history that the slaughter of children has been used as a marketing tool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But wait: There's also the fact that Jan. 19, slightly more than a month after 26 teachers and pupils were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School, has been set aside as the first “Gun Appreciation Day.” Its motto: “Hands off our guns.” I think we have a winner, folks!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, in all of this, the thing that unsettled me most was discovering that Gabrielle Giffords still owns a Glock. The former Arizona congresswoman, who was shot in the head two years ago in Tucson during a failed assassination attempt that killed six other people, has made a stunning return to public life. I've just read Gabby, the memoir co-written with her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, and wanted to hear her speak about her gun-control views: Although a Democrat, she'd never been an advocate before. In fact, just a few months before she was shot, Ms. Giffords told NPR, “In my district and in my state, we have a very strong gun culture. I own a gun, members of my family own guns.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, when Diane Sawyer questioned her during an ABC interview this week, Ms. Giffords admitted she still has her Glock pistol. Her husband said he'd recently bought a gun at <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> (the same chain, incidentally, where Ms. Giffords' assailant, Jared Loughner, bought his ammunition). A Cornell-educated politician and a space-shuttle commander – one of them nearly killed by gun violence – and they both own guns. It seems absurd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's not, because their position as gun fans allows them to be a forceful and effective opposition to the NRA. They're not Brooklyn quinoa-eaters or wet-eyed Hollywood stars. “We're strong supporters of the Second Amendment,” Mr. Kelly said. Together, they've set up a political action committee called Americans for Responsible Solutions, which is essentially a gun control advocacy group for gun owners (it will lobby for stronger background checks and restrictions on ammunition sales). Mr. Kelly said he was particularly motivated by one statistic: 85 per cent of the children killed by guns in the world are American.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could this finally be a red-meat rival to the powerful gun lobby? The Christian Science Monitor wrote about Giffords, Kelly and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg as a gun-control “dream team” – tough, pragmatic, experienced, politically moderate, fiscally conservative. The kind of people fence-sitters might listen to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe it's the prospect of a powerful opposition (finally) taking shape that's caused so much hysteria among the pry-my-cold-dead-fingers-off-the-trigger brigade. Talk-show host and conspiracy enthusiast Alex Jones appeared in a showdown of spittle with Piers Morgan on CNN, vowing that the dastardly British and their muskets would never steal Americans' guns or freedom ever again. And a shooting instructor in Tennessee, James Yeager, seemed in danger of a stroke as he ranted in a <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> video about the possibility of President Barack Obama using an executive order to push gun control: “I'm not letting my country be ruled by a dictator. I'm not letting anybody take my guns. If it goes one inch further I'm going to start killing people.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voices from the fringe, perhaps. The real battle moves to the centre of power this week when Mr. Biden's task force presents its gun-control recommendations to President Obama. But the President's got intransigent Republicans to deal with on the economy already. Does he really have the willpower to shove a bill through Congress (where, The Wall Street Journal points out, more than half the members are given a top A grade from the NRA)? Maybe if there are enough powerful, deep-pocketed, arm-twisting allies behind him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moment is now, with the American public's mind still filled with thoughts of Sandy Hook, but is the moment enough? It took 12 years after James Brady was shot during the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan for the Brady handgun bill to become law. Let's hope Gabby Giffords won't have to wait as long.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ontario, the chaos has descended into farce. The elementary-school union ordered the teachers out of class on Friday to protest legislation that sent them back to work. Then a labour board ruling forced them back in. Parents are fed up; everyone is mad. Most people blame the unions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I hope my union leadership is happy now,” a teacher told me in an e-mail. “We've made ourselves look ridiculous. Is there anyone we have failed to alienate?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to the next decade. Wherever you live in Canada, whatever party your provincial government happens to belong to, strife in the schools is about to become a way of life. The public-sector pie is shrinking, and everybody on the public payroll will have to take a hit. That's why Ontario's education-friendly government cracked down on the teachers. If they're not reined in, everybody else will fight back, too. More than 1.1-million people in Ontario – civil servants, social workers, nurses, teachers, police, garbage collectors – are on the public payroll; their collective paycheque amounts to around $58-billion a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The case for public-sector unions is arguable at the best of times. Public employees are supposed to behave in the public interest. But the more entrenched and powerful their unions become, the more money they are able to extract in the form of raises, bankable sick days, job security, generous pensions, rigid work rules, and the like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unions' job is to act in the interest of members, which is inevitably contrary to the broader interests of the public. Politicians are happy to comply because the public purse is bottomless (until it's not).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teachers regard themselves, rightly, as professionals. But the standards and practices that govern most professionals don't apply to them. Their official work hours are precisely regulated. They have no meaningful performance reviews. They don't get merit pay. And virtually nobody gets fired for poor teaching. God help us if extracurricular activities become part of their union contracts, because then the coaching, the yearbook, the prom, the chess club, and all those other unquantifiable but crucial interactions with the kids will become just as regulated (and subject to union negotiation) as classroom time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teachers' unions are obsolete for other reasons, too. If children were widgets, and schools were the assembly line through which they pass from kindergarten through Grade 12, the union model might make sense. But kids aren't widgets and teachers aren't factory workers. Every kid is different, and the process of learning is nuanced and complex. The old industrial model of education, which was explicitly designed to produce a steady flow of reliable workers for the industrial age, is completely unsuited to the world we live in now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost every aspect of our lives has been transformed since grandma went to school. Yet the education industry is remarkably impervious to change. Kids still go to school at fixed times and sit through a series of fixed class periods where information is chopped up into “subjects.” As Salman Khan, the brilliant founder of the Khan Academy, observes, instructional practice has barely changed since the late 1800s. There are too many interests invested in the way things are. “Any effort at change is smothered under the vast weight of educational orthodoxy,” he writes in his new book, The One World Schoolhouse. The main aspects of the system are “inertia and resistance to new and threatening ideas.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One example of a new and threatening idea is that the standard classroom model – what Mr. Khan calls the one-pace-fits-all lecture – is a highly inefficient way to teach and learn. Teachers try to work around this, but they can't do much about it. They're pretty much forced to teach to the middle of the pack, which means slow and fast kids are shortchanged. The system is hardest on the slower kids, who are passed along the line before they master basic concepts. This explains why so many kids graduate from high school without the functional ability to read, write or do basic mathematics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Khan Academy was born when Mr. Khan (who was educated at MIT and Harvard) began posting short instructional videos on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>. Students can watch them at their own time and pace until they get the concept, and they can also take targeted self-assessment tests. His big idea is to flip the classroom model, so that independent learning replaces in-class lectures, and class time is used for creative work, problem-solving and personal coaching from the teacher. The videos are now used around the world, and even in a few schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other fields have been revolutionized by new technology and new ideas. Why can't education do the same? Why can't teachers be liberated to be far more effective than they are? The answer is obvious. Public education is a monopoly, which means it doesn't have to change. The dead weight of bureaucracy and tradition repel innovation. The teachers' unions aren't entirely to blame for this, of course – they're just part of a bigger problem. Their reason for being is to preserve the status quo. That's why you can expect more strife at the schools and very little talk about better ways to educate kids.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was two weeks ago in this space that I offered a New Year's wish for 2013: no more closings in Vancouver's arts sector.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, so much for that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Waldorf Hotel was – I guess still is, for a few days – a truly special place, alive with ideas and innovation and – you know what? – fun. There was a sense of whimsy to the place that was palpable, which emanated from the guys operating and programming the joint with such care and excitement. Daniel Fazio, one of the partners operating the hotel, and its director of brand and design, called it a sort of “Disneyland” during a tour he gave me in 2011, and that's exactly how it felt. If you're the kind of person who gets excited by art and ideas, you were like a kid in a candy store in that cultural playground, to mix artistic metaphors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upstairs is the tiny art gallery, an important little venue for emerging artists that made great use of a former guest room – even the washroom is an exhibition space. Downstairs, the Cabaret: an excellent music venue with an eclectic range of offerings. In between, that beloved Tiki bar. And always the coolest cultural programming throughout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I remember exactly where Mr. Fazio made the Disneyland comment. We were on our way to the parking lot, to visit a shipping container that was being turned into an art gallery by Dida Zende, a visiting artist from Berlin who reclaims old spaces and turns them into creative venues (he usually uses gas stations). Inside, fellow Waldorf operator, entertainment director (and musician) Thomas Anselmi was working on a video installation. For me, Vancouver never felt more world class than it did inside that tiny, dark shipping container.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside, the parking lot was busy; they were building a midway, complete with a Drop of Doom, for what was to be an artistic amusement-park installation experience, with classical carnival games re-imagined artists. Not exactly your average Halloween party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is just one example, a tiny slice of the smart, eclectic programming happening at the Waldorf. Insiders often referred to it as “the compound,” and that's how it felt: this hotel (where the guest rooms played second a fiddle to the art) was a sort of innovation laboratory, a breeding ground for ideas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is why the city – or a segment of it, anyway – is reacting the way it is. Petitions have been launched on change.org attracting thousands of signatures; activists Lindsay Brown and Sandy Garossino have started a “Vancouver Loves the Waldorf” group, calling the hotel “the heartbeat of our city” and “a unique cultural institution whose contribution to arts and entertainment in Vancouver is unprecedented and broad.” The venue as it is, run by this team, can never be replaced, they say in a news release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even city hall is reacting, possibly to the reactions, with a report coming to council Tuesday about protecting the Waldorf and discussing options for continuing an arts and culture venue, possibly at the hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People talk about the Waldorf being the centre of cultural life for East Vancouver. I think it goes beyond East Van: It's a cultural centre, period, attracting artists both established (Douglas Coupland, Michael Turner, Paul Wong) and emerging, who would create or show work there that was often offbeat and thrilling. This was not the arts institution you grew up on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For musicians, it has been a great place to play, but also to just hang out. And they did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm feeling pretty gutted,” wrote Vancouver-based musician and Waldorf regular (she's a fan of the Monday night Ice Cream Socials) Louise Burns in an e-mail this week from Los Angeles, where she's recording an album. “Watching Vancouver slowly commit cultural suicide is a difficult thing to do.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a profanity-laced tweet, Polaris-nominated musician Grimes, a Vancouver native, expressed similar displeasure, criticizing the city: “you've destroyed nearly every piece of culture that you had.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the many, many discussions (interviews, casual conversations, passionate e-mail exchanges) I engaged in last year over the closing of the Vancouver Playhouse Theatre Company, one of the comments that really gave me pause came from someone who works in theatre. Though devastated, he argued that models for cultural institutions evolve, and as awful as the Playhouse closing was, there was exciting theatre happening in the city that had grown out of it, and could fill that void.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've thought a lot about that argument this week. Because the Waldorf is exactly the kind of next-generation, grassroots, from-the-ground up alternative art scene that should be flourishing here. And it was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Waldorf was a place I loved to go – for performances, parties, interviews, whatever; a place I was proud to be able to walk to from my home; a place that made Vancouver better – even beyond the so-called cultural community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I can't think of a more appropriate word to describe how so many of us are feeling – or what's happening to the city – than the one Ms. Burns chose: gutted.</p>

This has overshadowed the practical conversations between the federal government and a part of the first-nations leadership, and also the actual progress on land-use agreements announced today.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Ian Brodie, a former chief of staff to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, sagely observed in a tweet, “I offer this as advice to anyone who thinks you accomplish more by not meeting the PM than by meeting him. You don't.” Chiefs from Quebec, British Columbia, Alberta and the Atlantic provinces, along with Shawn A-in-chut Atleo, the Chief of the AFN – not intimidated by a threat of a no-confidence motion – recognized this truth, while chiefs from Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories in effect denied themselves that valuable access. Indeed, some native protesters tried to obstruct their own leaders from entering the Langevin Block of the Parliament Buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Mr. Harper could, from the outset, have expressed the gracious side of his nature in making himself available for more than the initial half-hour, just as he unexpectedly stayed for the whole session last year, at the first Crown-First-Nations Gathering. Instead his presence for the full four or five hours was announced when it was about halfway through. It is not to diminish John Duncan, the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs, or Tony Clement, the President of the Treasury Board (always scheduled to be present throughout) to say that the early assurance of Mr. Harper's full participation would have added much authority to the discussions. Moreover, though any participation in these discussions by Governor-General David Johnston would have been a grave constitutional violation, his symbolic presence as a silent witness might have done no harm – and could have been a basis for subsequent, strictly private consultations between him and the Prime Minister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is welcome news that Mr. Harper wants a second meeting that includes Chief Spence. The petulant boycotters should now drop their obstructionism.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I tried to entertain myself, during the not-infrequent points in Wednesday night's Nelly Furtado concert that called for supplemental entertainment, by imagining the backstage, pre-show pep talk she might have received. “Yeah, I know we had to move the show from the larger Orpheum Theatre next door and haven't come close to selling out this smaller joint. I know that you played to a more-than-half-empty arena last night in Victoria and, yeah, I know that Victoria's your hometown. But you're Nelly Furtado!”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's unclear just how many people turned out for the show at Vancouver's Commodore Ballroom – concert promoter <span class="companylink">Live Nation</span> would not release attendance figures – but the venue has a capacity of just under 1,000, and there was enough room that even a latecomer could get near enough to the stage for a close-up view of those signature cheekbones and piercing eyes. The bars weren't busy, the T-shirt sellers looked lonely. Whoa, indeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I love an underdog, and I wanted to see Furtado grab the Ballroom and turn this maybe half-empty venue into one that was half-full. But from the instant she walked onstage in her sparkly tank top, dark fedora and signature hoops, and launched into the first nasally notes of The Spirit Indestructible, the title track of her new album, I had my doubts she could pull it off – or even cared to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furtado, who has sold millions of albums since her 2000 debut Whoa, Nelly!, still has the vocal chops and stage presence, but the show was uneven. It took a few numbers for her to hit her stride, but throughout, there were moments of disconnection or worse. There was a strange bit where the Grim Reaper, complete with bright-green feather boa, came onstage with a bucket full of bucket-list wishes left by audience members. Furtado read a few, and then launched into the song Bucket List. It was awkward, went on too long, didn't work. Her Be OK duet with opener Dylan Murray was anything but; he sang flat – although she held it together as the audience collectively cringed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Furtado brought it for a high-energy, fabulously thumping version of Turn off the Light, immediately followed by a lovely played-straight Like a Bird – though the Whoa, Nelly! one-two punch came surprisingly early in the set and any momentum it might have created came crashing to a halt when Furtado leaped straight into Steve Miller's Fly Like an Eagle (which was weird, but not nearly as weird as her cover of Madonna's Like a Prayer later in the evening). This gave members of the audience no chance to show their appreciation, which they desperately wanted to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other highlights were Forca, with Furtado on ukulele, and an emotional Try, which had the audience singing along, some even tearing up, feeling the pain of their youth once again. Big Hoops (Bigger the Better) had the place pumping and sounded far better live than on her new, not-very-well-reviewed album. Ditto for High Life – even though she had a false start and had to begin again. “I forgot the lyrics,” she told the audience, in a rare human confession (most of her banter consisted of lines like “Hey Vancouver!”). The screw-up was one of the best moments of the night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concert ended abruptly with Maneater, after which Furtado offered a quick goodbye and exited stage right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furtado can be better than this. So can this show, which has the potential to improve as it moves across the country. But how many people will be there to see it?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, I spent the first days of my son's life breastfeeding round the clock and watching Season 1 of HBO's Girls. I was delirious with exhaustion, but it was a magical and gratifying experience, one that I now evangelically recommend to all my female friends. The TV show, obviously, not the baby.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You'd think it would be fantastically irritating to watch drunk twentysomethings crazy-dance at warehouse parties while I was lactating on the sofa in a nightgown, but it wasn't. I identified emphatically with the girls on Girls, which returns for a second season Sunday night – the anxious one, the cool one, the perfect one, and the naked one. I was all of them. Even though, demographically speaking, I'm anything but.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm in my 30s, which is obvious since I'm middle-class and I have a baby (I know only one university-educated woman who reproduced young, and it startled me at the time). Still have a baby, in fact, because unlike boyfriends in your 20s, who also steal your heart and communicate their feelings in three-a.m. histrionics, babies tend to stick around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was more appropriately targeted, though in some ways discomfited, by that other newly released Judd Apatow joint, This is 40. Which is not to say I'm 40. (Did my voice just get really loud and squeaky there?) I am SO NOT 40. But the movie is funny. And I say that as someone who tried hard not to identify when the wife accuses her husband of hiding in the bathroom with his iPad, and then confronts him with a “Do better” list, because I don't go in for that kind of bourgeois crap. Except I totally do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My problem is that I want to be all the decades all the time. I want to crazy-dance at a warehouse party and then spring out of bed and bake spiced pumpkin loaf for breakfast. And I'm not alone. (Actually I'm never alone. That's how family life works: You spend the first 30 years of your life wondering if you'll always be alone and the next 30 wondering if you'll ever be alone.) The crazy-dancing/pumpkin loaf equation is what everyone I know secretly wants. We want to be young and on-the-cusp and mature and comfortably established all at the same time. Most of us are trying to do both – that's why the paunchy Dad on your street longboards to his preschool pickup. It's also why the barrista with the asymmetrical haircut is making her own artisanal cheese.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet, so much of our entertainment today, whether books, movies or TV shows, seems served up in tidy demographically specific packages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the triumph of the marketing people of course, with their viral branding and social-media buzzwhack. They are responsible for everything depressing about our culture, including (but not limited to) espresso martinis and reminders from LinkedIn. Their pernicious influence casts a creepy shadow over what Apatow, Girls's Lena Dunham – and other talented creative folk – are actually trying to do, which is make smart, funny stories about flawed people muddling through life, not sanitized cultural products for obedient decade-somethings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shadow extends to books. Take the two very good ones I happen to be reading at the moment. The first is F*ck! I'm in My Twenties, a graphic novel of cutely neurotic observations about being young and confused, by U.S. author Emma Koenig. You will not be surprised to learn that Koenig is in her 20s and has a TV-development deal based on her book, which was based on a blog, which was based on her life. Because everyone knows if you're 24 these days and don't have a development deal based on a book based on a blog based on your life, you're screwed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or at least you believe you are. Because self-doubt seems to be the big theme running through Koenig's book, which features lots of amusing Venn diagrams and rhetorical questions in cool fonts, such as: “Am I going through puberty all over again?”; “Is everyone else actually happier than me or are they just pretending?”; “Why is our relationship so complicated? We aren't even sleeping together!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other book is a comic novel called Mutton, by British author India Knight. It's about a fortysomething divorcée with three kids living in London and looking for love. The novel manages to pose, in bright, brusque, posh-accented tones, all the same questions as does Koenig's. Take this musing by the protagonist: “There comes a point where time starts feeling like looking through the wrong end of the telescope, and suddenly things that seemed far away are dramatically closer, and really – if I'm not going to be blissfully happy romantically speaking, I'd rather be happy domestically and pootle on, hope springing eternal. Basically I just want the lolz, even if landing the lolz is a form of midlife crisis in itself, which I suspect it might be.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apart from the dubious use of text slang, Knight is saying that getting older is confusing for everyone and that self-doubt exists at all ages – which is a serious bummer for those twentysomethings hoping for the sense of well-being and purpose to descend once the big development deal comes through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what I wonder, while vacillating between somewhere between twentysomethingness and forty-somethingness in the sticky chaos of my thirties, is: Why does every decade now have to be such an existential crisis in and of itself? Will Koenig be capping off her career with a quirky little volume called F*ck! I'm in My Nineties? Now there's a book that deserves a development deal. Lolz, as if.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adults and children will undoubtedly be in plentiful supply Sunday evening at Toronto's Ed Mirvish Theatre as the curtain goes up on the premiere of a new Canadian production of the Andrew Lloyd Webber/Tim Rice adaptation of The Wizard of Oz. For decades, nothing has spelled “fun for the whole family” more than L. Frank Baum's most famous creation. With the possible exception of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, published in 1865, no ostensible children's story of the last century and a half has so successfully insinuated itself into virtually every facet of the popular culture. Whether as autonomous creation or font of umpteen riffs and references, The Wizard of Oz is simply a fact of life and art.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It hasn't always been thus, however. For all its seeming unassailability as both pop-culture inspiration and self-sustaining classic, The Wizard of Oz has had a fraught, contentious history, especially the original 1900 novel (published as The Wonderful Wizard of Oz) and the 13 sequels Baum composed before his death at 62 in 1919. In the mid-1920s, for example, Detroit's library system removed Oz titles from its stacks and kept them out until the late 1950s. “This is not banning; this is selection” was the way the system's director defended the policy. Oz books, he argued, were poorly written, “old-fashioned,” burdened with “too much exaggeration,” and “negativism,” embraced “a cowardly approach to life” and lacked the quality of the tales of the Brother Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen. (When The Detroit Times discovered that Baum had been persona non grata for at least 30 years, it began a daily serialization of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz in its pages.) Thirty years later, Christian fundamentalists in Tennessee succeeded in getting legal sanction to pull their children from public-school classes in which the Baum novel – to their eyes a work of “godless supernaturalism” – was being taught.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no denying that Oz's universe of munchkins, witches (wicked and good), Yellow Brick Roads, Emerald Cities, endangered innocents (innocence) and anthropomorphic characters like the Cowardly Lion, is odd. But it's that very weirdness, its elusive and allusive ambiguity, its refusal to settle into one-size-fits-all didactic, that gives it the enduring vitality and porosity not found in, say, Tom Swift and His Photo Telephone or Horatio Alger's Luke Walton (the Chicago Newsboy), to cite some other children's texts from Baum's time. There's an Oz, it seems, to inform every era, technology and sensibility – be they those kids in the 1990s who synchronized the music of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon with the 1939 Judy Garland movie, or the epic transmogrifications of Baumian themes in the panoramas of Chicago artist Henry Darger (1892-1973), or the way Sean Connery's reading of The Wizard of Oz at the conclusion of the trippy sci-fi drama Zardoz (1974) serves as a decoder of sorts for the film's hallucinatory logic. Coming in March is Sam Raimi's movie Oz: The Great and Powerful, a prequel of sorts to the original 1900 yarn with James Franco as a small-time circus magician transported to the Land of Oz where he meets, among others, Glinda the Good Witch (Michelle Williams).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Writing in 1900, Baum claimed he conceived his “modernized fairy-tale … solely to please children of today.” Almost a century after his death, he's still succeeding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wizard of Oz continues at the Ed Mirvish Theatre, 244 Victoria St., Toronto. Tickets at mirvish.com.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's how it works – there are three TV models. There's network TV, which anyone can access and which relies on ads to make to money. There's basic cable (channels such as FX, which delivers Justified and Sons of Anarchy), to which you subscribe, but also has ads. And then there's premium cable (<span class="companylink">HBO</span>), which has no ads but requires customers to pay a more substantial fee to see its content.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now there's <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> , which has previously operated only as a library, allowing TV viewers access to movies and shows made by broadcasters and studios. This year, <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> is getting into the original-content business. It's producing dramas and comedies you can watch, at any time, without ads, as long as you're a paid-up <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> subscriber.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new importance of <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> is underlined by its presence this year at <span class="companylink">the Television Critics Association</span> press tour, where new network and cable shows are presented and promoted to critics. <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> took just a two-hour slot in a two-week tour, but got tons of attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're leading the next great wave of change in the medium of TV,” Ted Sarandos , <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> 's head of content, told the TV critics this week. “We're not trying to destroy it, but evolve it for the current generation and those to come.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What that means, in mundane TV terms, is that <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> will roll out its first batch of original series, movies and miniseries between February and May. It has made a new season of the old Fox series Arrested Development, a cult hit. It has a political drama, House of Cards, starring Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright , and directed by David Fincher. And its offerings also include the supernatural thriller series Hemlock Grove and a new Ricky Gervais vehicle called Derek.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the teasers and trailers available, all look slick. Mind you, it's impossible to tell if they are of any true quality. But <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> , with its deep pockets – money accrued from subscribers who want to see movies and old episodes of TV shows – says it knows what it is doing. It studies what subscribers pay to watch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's rather like the library getting into the book-publishing business because it can tell what people like to read. Great idea, but fraught because the public's taste is fickle and the public is so easily distracted.And the fact that some major talent has signed up for <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> projects is no guarantee of quality and major-impact product. Wave money around in Hollywood and everyone with an idea will come to you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those from the traditional TV industry point out that there is no measurement for success with the <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> content – no ratings. Nobody here can tell if something is a hit if there is no report-card data on who watched and when they watched. And what sort of viewer they are – age group, income and location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The day before the <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> newbies came here, FX president John Landgraf was dismissive about the <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> threat. He said that a ratings report “keeps you honest” because you can't fool anybody into thinking a show succeeds with viewers. The Nielsen numbers are real, he asserted, and <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> avoids the Nielsen ratings. <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> 's Sarandos wasn't impressed. “We're going to measure a show's success on multiple metrics,” he said. “But one of them will not be time-slot viewing. We'll measure viewership over the life of a licence and invest proportionately to the payback in terms of customer love of the show – the customer retention, new subscribers, brand halo. If people watch it at a certain time, it doesn't matter. It's not our business to attract people at certain times so I can sell them <span class="companylink">Ford</span> trucks. What John Landgraf is talking about is fine, but that's not our business.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thing is, both are correct. While <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> is the alluring, shiny new thing in the TV racket, it's no saviour of original, well-made drama and comedy; it's not a new dawn in television. As a business, it needs original content to keep its customer base. It has no access to premium, talked-About TV series or movies made by <span class="companylink">HBO</span> or Showtime. You can't see <span class="companylink">HBO</span>'s Girls on <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> , and if everybody is buzzing about Girls, <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> is losing out. <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> hopes desperately that you'll be talking about House of Cards and Hemlock Grove.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> is making many people in Hollywood very happy – show creators, actors and directors. “These guys at <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> are really experimental, fresh thinkers,” said Mitch Hurwitz, the creator of Arrested Development. “In an early meeting I had with Ted, they said they were going to put a <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> button on remote controls. And I said, ‘Why didn't NBC put a Peacock on remotes?' It's just because NBC predated the remote control. <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> comes in and looks at it all fresh. You've got to follow the audience, and we're just embracing it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's great, but a cult comedy being revived isn't a revolution. How many will watch? How will anyone know if it's worth making more of Arrested Development?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ratings issue rankled Sarandos, though. “I don't know why <span class="companylink">HBO</span>, Showtime – any of them – publish ratings,” he said. “It might be for internal reasons, or to manage the relationships with cable operators, but we don't have relationships with cable operators to manage. There's no business reason for us to publish ratings other than to create artificial pressure on a show to perform on a short time frame. We don't need to add that to the mix. There's enough pressure in creating television as it is.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">True and that's not the half of it. The online service <span class="companylink">Hulu</span> has original content. Amazon and <span class="companylink">Google</span> are getting into the game. No network or cable channel is unaware of the competition, and all are striving to make better shows to keep viewers. Traditional TV is not dead, dying or desperate. Cable challenged network TV, and now <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> challenges everybody. Until everybody sees the <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> content and either shrugs or cheers, there's nothing to be afraid of.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airing this weekend</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 70th Annual Golden Globe Awards (Sunday, NBC, <span class="companylink">CTV</span>, 8 p.m.) lacks Ricky Gervais but has Tina Fey and <span class="companylink">Parks and Recreation</span>'s Amy Poehler as co-hosts, which is no guarantee of fun. Expect lots of jokes about Les Misérables and Girls. Don't expect much bite in the handling of the giddy showbiz attendees, or the nominated movies and TV series. The red-carpet coverage starts on E! Canada at 6 p.m., and the official red carpet coverage is on NBC at 7 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Girls (Sunday, HBO Canada, 9 p.m.) is back, as the whole world knows. On the evidence of the first two episodes, this is a meaner, more melancholy group of characters. Aimless, worried and a little frightened of the adult world, they are harder to like, these young women. But still shockingly real.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Weekly Challenge is a column that tackles self-improvement seven days at a time.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I returned home from a 10-day trip to Florida last week feeling like a deep-fried salt lick. A steady diet of blender drinks, conch fritters and key lime pie had been sensational at the time, but I hardly wanted to launch my body, mind and liver into the New Year as a Jimmy Buffett song stereotype.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flying into Pearson airport, I tried to recall my last exchange with a vegetable that didn't come out of a salsa jar. Obviously, it was time for a nutritional about-face, but the whole idea of a cleanse has always struck me as a little hippie-dippie, never mind hypocritical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In my experience, these “detox” programs (the juice ones, the food ones, the ones that involve supplement pills) are almost always practised by women who claim to be interested in getting healthy when all they really want to do is get skinny. Not that there's anything wrong with trying to drop a few pounds (I had definitely put on a few over my holiday), but spare me the whole my-body-is-a-temple 'tude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe it's just my social circle, but I've observed more than one acquaintance smoking while supposedly detoxing. All of that said, I wondered whether I could even stick to one of these juice cleanses, which have become a booming business. My willpower surrounding food has always been pretty pathetic, and just the smell of V8 nauseates me. Getting my green on was not going to be easy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A surprising passion for chickpeas</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My three-day juice diet from Toronto delivery service Total Cleanse was dropped off on my doorstep in the middle of the night. The following morning I eyed the day's first “meal” – a 500-ml blend of kale, celery, cucumber, lettuce, apple, parsley and lemon – with suspicion. Then I glanced longingly at the coffee machine. Going without a java jolt on weekends or holidays is no problem, but on a workday that first cup of joe is my on switch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The green drink tasted like a juice bar smells, and while by no means undrinkable, it failed to offer the same kick-start to my day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later I met my friend Bridgitte for “lunch.” Normally I would have put this off until post-cleanse, but she was leaving Toronto the next day, which is why I ended up sitting in a restaurant, taking in the hypnotic eau de hamburger. Asking the waiter if I could have a glass for my green drink was awkward – in that moment, I was the kind of woman I can't stand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While I downed my liquid lunch, Bridgitte's appetizer arrived at the table. It was hummus and pita, something I would never order myself, but with a half-empty glass of juice before me, it looked like the most delicious thing I'd ever seen. I tried to ignore the smooth-talking devil on my shoulder telling me, “Go ahead – hummus is just blended chickpeas … which is basically juice … pretty sure it's a super food.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then I cheated. Not a lot, but enough to make me feel significant legume-induced guilt, which I later medicated with a glass of red wine. Strike two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the love of food</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The medical community is not entirely on board with the cleanse mania, mostly because our bodies are built to self-cleanse – that's what our livers and kidneys are for. Like the Atkins or Dukan diet, juicing is a trend that, from what I can deduce, has become popular for a few reasons: 1) Unlike many diets and nutrition plans, it involves zero prep time and/or culinary ability. You don't have to seek out strange ingredients at the health-food store, nor labour over a pot of stinky cabbage soup; 2) There is a sense of accomplishment from sticking to the plan, which I did manage to do for the next two days of my cleanse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, fine, I almost stuck to it. On the last night I ate two bites of my boyfriend's chicken curry. I wasn't hungry so much as desperately missing the fun of food.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am one of those people who spends much of the day fantasizing about dinner. I waste hours looking at food porn online, my favourite social event is a meal with friends and I love a grocery store the way Lindsay Lohan loves a tanning salon. Without meal planning or prep, my evening ritual was totally out of whack – I was in bed every night by 10, because what else was there to do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, I think I managed to counterbalance some of my holiday sins and lose a few of those pina colada pounds. I'm in no rush to go back to a juice-only existence, but I did find a recipe for a homemade green drink and plan to start my day with one as often as I can. That and a good, strong coffee.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My son, who was born in December, will be eligible to enter kindergarten next year. Should I hold him back a year?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no question that the almost one-year difference in maturity between those born in January and those born in December is significant. Although 12 months may not seem like much, for young children this represents a 20-per-cent difference in life experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elementary-school teachers I spoke to say that they can see a difference in reading, writing and level of social maturity when they compare kindergarten students born early in the year with those born in November and December. They also noted that this difference in abilities is generally no longer noticeable by the time the children get to about Grade 3. This makes intuitive sense, as the relative difference in age diminishes with each passing year. Educational research confirms that by Grade 4, age difference is not as important as factors such as the educational level and economic status of their parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Malcolm Gladwell offers a different opinion in his book Outliers: The Story of Success. Gladwell suggests that children who are older than their peers because of the timing of their birthday have a distinct long-term advantage. Outliers looks at athletes, and how the majority of elite Canadian junior-hockey players tend to be born in the first few months of the year. He claims this same effect may also apply to school performance, as children born later in the year tend to be under-represented at U.S. colleges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what's a parent to do? If your child has met developmental milestones, communicates easily, socializes readily and can follow simple instructions, then he or she is probably ready for kindergarten, even if that means being one of the youngest in the class. If your child has been slower to meet milestones, has difficulty expressing himself and struggles to make friends, then waiting a year may be in his best interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For families who wait, I encourage them to enroll their child in a full-time preschool or daycare program so they can develop their social and academic skills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many families, school entry may also be dictated by financial considerations or employment obligations. If this is the case, and you suspect your child might be at risk of having difficulties in kindergarten, don't hesitate to discuss your concerns with school officials. It is the responsibility of schools to be prepared for children at all levels of readiness.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public support for the Harper government in the weeks ahead will hinge on how well it handles the native protests that threaten to escalate this week.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus far, the Conservatives have gotten the big things right, by ignoring peaceful demonstrations and engaging with the responsible leadership in order to marginalize extremists. That is about what Canadians expect from their government at times like this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The militant tendency within the native movement is vowing a day of action Wednesday that could block roads, bridges and rail lines in Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and elsewhere. There are other protests planned for Jan. 28, when Parliament resumes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The opposition parties have already staked their ground: The native protests, they maintain, are rooted in centuries of injustice compounded by Conservative intransigence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is not a comedy of errors but it's a tragedy of errors that we find ourselves in this situation today,” Interim Liberal Leader Bob Rae maintained. Both the NDP and Liberals insist Mr. Harper must deal swiftly and substantively with native claims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But public expectations are low. Last summer, Nanos Research and the Institute for Research on Public Policy produced a study that rated major issues by two criteria: how important a policy challenge was to the public, and how confident the public was that government could meet the challenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First nations issues ranked at the very bottom in both public importance and in public confidence that government could make things better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Idle No More movement and Chief Theresa Spence's hunger strike may have increased the importance of native issues for most Canadians, it is unlikely they are any more confident that anything can be done. Mr. Nanos described that attitude as a sense of “public-policy futility.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course the Harper government is, like all governments, most interested in keeping its own supporters onside. The Conservative coalition consists, in part, of rural voters in Ontario and voters in the West apart from downtown Vancouver. These voters tend to be impatient with native demands for greater control over land and resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other part of the coalition consists of suburban immigrant voters in Ontario. Most of them come from places such as India, the Philippines and China, which also suffered colonial oppression. They are themselves the children of the dispossessed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While they may empathize with native Canadians, most immigrant Canadians are willing, even eager, to integrate into Canadian society. It would hardly be surprising in that case if they had only limited empathy for native claims to land and sovereignty, and little sense of collective responsibility for the poverty on many reserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remember: There are roughly 370,000 first nations living on reserves. About 250,000 immigrants, almost all from non-European societies, arrive in Canada every year. Time is not on the natives' side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harper also knows that he faces a divided opposition. Native leaders who are unhappy with National Chief Shawn Atleo's willingness to negotiate with the Harper government are challenging his leadership of the <span class="companylink">Assembly of First Nations</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Again, politically, this works to the Prime Minister's advantage. If Mr. Harper can demonstrate that he takes native demands seriously and that he can and will work with Mr. Atleo and the AFN, then there will be little public sympathy for the militants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wild card is anarchy. If the chiefs opposing Mr. Atleo and the Idle No More activists escalate their demonstrations to the point where there is risk of violence or serious economic disruption, then the federal government will have to be firm in enforcing the rule of law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that is exactly the moment at which events can spiral out of control: Oka; the Dudley George shooting. Then no one can predict what will happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short of that, if the Harper government stays the current course, then the Conservative coalition of support should hold and the government should emerge from this winter of native discontent in reasonable shape – politically, at least.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vincent van Gogh said: “We are not here for ourselves alone.” This man was no mere painter of sunflowers or starry nights. He was a true philosopher whose words still ring true more than a century later.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's an economic truth to his quote that's especially poignant for Alberta in 2013. Out west, we've had it pretty good. Unemployment is low, incomes are high, and the GDP is set to grow faster than almost anywhere. But what would van Gogh say? We are not here for ourselves alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta is experiencing some record-setting immigration. Job seekers from around the country and the world are choosing Alberta because of the excellent opportunities. We talk of “labour shortages” and insufficient “human resources” in phrases that regard immigrants like commodities rather than human beings. “Welcome to Alberta, you human resource. Take your place and get to work!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sadly, we focus on what immigrants can do for us (fill jobs) rather than on what we can do for them (provide beautiful communities and the chance to participate in building something amazing). It won't end well for Alberta if we keep that attitude. Migrant workers will treat Alberta like the national ATM: Get your cash and get out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Van Gogh's words also strike a chord when we think of Alberta's abundant resources. The worrying question used to be: What if we run out of oil? That's been answered. We will never, ever run out of oil. Now the more daunting question is: What if we can't transport our oil to the buyers? Or worse, what if they don't need our oil any more? Those questions should send shivers of terror down the spines of Albertans with children in schools or parents in hospitals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, the attitude in the energy patch has been: “We must build pipelines. The world needs our oil. Nothing can get in the way. This is not negotiable.” Oil and pipeline companies are running headlong into some unanticipated opposition from folks who don't see it the same way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What if resource producers changed their approach, aligning more with van Gogh's words reminding us that we are not here for ourselves alone? Could we consider our energy resources as a gift rather than something the world simply needs? (And at current low prices for Western Canadian oil, “gift” is not far from reality.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By considering our energy as something we offer to the rest of the world, we would willingly ensure that these gifts are in acceptable condition. That means being a world leader in environmental stewardship, rather than arrogantly comparing ourselves to Nigeria or Sudan and patting ourselves on the back because our human rights are better than theirs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You wouldn't give a cheap, second-hand wedding gift wrapped in a used garbage bag to a loved one and say: “Well, it's still better than the crappy toaster oven you got from your Uncle Jack.” Some of the most successful corporations in the world view their product or service as something offered to make their customers happy and their lives better, rather than something they're obligated to purchase. (Does anyone harbour fond feelings for the companies that printed and sold us our required reading textbooks in university? I didn't think so).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And successful companies honour their customers in the presentation. Apple doesn't sell its products in miserable packaging, nor does Louis Vuitton simply chuck its wares in an ugly plastic bag. They respect the buyer by ensuring the product is in immaculate condition. That's part of their success. A critic might respond, “We're selling barrels of oil, not smartphones or handbags!” Still, that's no reason to disregard the world's citizens, who are Alberta's customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta is in a unique situation. It's been blessed enormously in resources, wealth, natural beauty and smart people. We really can do anything if we set our minds to it, but not if we do it only for short-term financial gain. We can offer the world abundant jobs and great communities.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This spring will mark 10 years since the Ontario Court of Appeal allowed the first legal same-sex marriages in Canada. For most Canadians, same-sex marriage is a settled issue. The latest census data confirmed the growing diversity of Canadian families. That's why it's puzzling that the federal government has recently spent public money fighting the recognition of gay relationships in Canada.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The issue is how Canadian law and authorities should treat same-sex couples who have contracted a civil partnership in the United Kingdom. Unlike Canada, the U.K. doesn't have marriage for same-sex couples. Rather, in 2004, it introduced civil partnerships for gay and lesbian couples as a form of relationship recognition that is materially the same as marriage in everything but name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question reached an Ontario court after the relationship breakdown of two Canadian men joined by a U.K. civil partnership. Returned to Canada, one filed for divorce and sought spousal support. The other argued that they could not be divorced in Canada on the basis that they were not spouses under Canadian law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately, the judge held that the two men were married for the purposes of Canadian law. She said that to find otherwise would be to perpetuate discrimination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's baffling is that the federal government intervened to oppose recognizing the U.K. civil partnership in Canada. It argued that the men should return to the U.K. and launch proceedings there because their relationship effectively didn't exist in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, same-sex unions can raise complex legal issues. A country that doesn't allow same-sex relationships may refuse to recognize the status of couples joined elsewhere. So may a state within a federation. The patchwork of gay marriage laws in the U.S. has caused headache and heartache for many gay men and lesbians and their families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, not every form of relationship recognition is tantamount to marriage. It's fair to be cautious about imposing obligations to which the partners hadn't consented. But in this case, the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span>'s rightful path was straightforward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian law and policy recognize same-sex marriage. The <span class="companylink">U.K.'s Parliament</span> has defended civil partnership for same-sex couples as equal to marriage. Canadian courts recognize the marriage of a straight couple married in the U.K. There is no reason why Canadian law shouldn't recognize the union of a gay couple with a U.K. civil partnership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ontario government recognized that viewing the two men as spouses was appropriate. But the federal government supported the sole alternative. Since neither federal law nor Ontario law has a civil union or civil partnership, refusing to recognize the marriage would view the men as strangers one to the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's troubling that this case fits into a bigger picture of the federal government's ambivalence toward same-sex marriage. Last year, Ottawa's lawyers argued similarly that the marriages of foreign gay men and lesbians performed in Canada were invalid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to media pressure, the government changed its tune. It promised to legislate quickly to secure the status of such marriages. The justice minister introduced a bill nearly a year ago, but it still has yet to be debated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That Ottawa spent public dollars to oppose the recognition of this relationship is a reminder that “separate but equal” is never truly equal. More than that, it raises questions about this government's commitment to upholding the equality of gay and lesbian families in Canada, a key part of supporting families.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be terrible if a national U.S. study of suicidal behaviour among teenagers led to less treatment, rather than more, for mentally ill or troubled adolescents, in that country or in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than half of suicidal teens received treatment of various kinds (not only from psychologists but also from spiritual leaders and probation officers) before they first had suicidal thoughts, or made a plan to commit suicide, or actually attempted it, the study found. But this should not be understood as a failure of treatment generally. Far from it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We need to identify children and teens who are struggling with mental illness, and get them into appropriate treatment, fast. “Most adolescents with mental disorders like depression or anxiety don't receive the treatments that we know are effective in treating these problems (such as ‘cognitive behaviour therapy'),” the author, Harvard psychology professor Matthew Nock, said in an interview by e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roughly nine in 10 youths who have suicidal thoughts also have a mental illness – not only depression but disruptive behaviour disorders, eating disorders or substance abuse, the study found. And there is no reason to believe, at least in Canada, that high-quality treatment is available within a reasonable time period when emotional or behavioural problems appear. “As a field, we have a very long way to go to better predict and prevent suicidal behaviours,” Dr. Nock said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study, published by the Journal of the American Medical Association Psychiatry, shows how widespread suicidal thoughts and plans are among adolescents. Twelve per cent of U.S. teens have suicidal thoughts, 4 per cent make suicide plans, and 4.1 per cent make attempts (some do so impulsively, and some with plans don't try it at all).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the stigma around mental illness falls away, more families and young people will be encouraged to seek help. At the moment, in this country, that help is often not there for those who need it, and who lack the resources to pay for it privately. We still have, as Dr. Nock says, a very long way to go.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government ought to take a restrained view of the practical implications of the Federal Court of Canada's decision last Tuesday concerning the Métis and non-status Indians. It should not be hasty to conclude that the judgment necessarily requires action to confer massive new benefits, make large transfers of Crown land or create a whole new class of reserves. The plaintiffs themselves were not asking for access to specific programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government had argued that the court should not deal with the case because it was too theoretical. As it turns out, the decision is indeed quite theoretical. Mr. Justice Michael Phelan wisely declined to impose on the Crown in right on Canada a fiduciary duty or a duty to negotiate with the Métis and non-status Indians.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This case was about the division of legislative powers, between the federal Parliament and the provincial legislatures, in the Constitution Act, 1867 – specifically about the meaning of the word “Indian” in the federal power to make laws about “Indians, and Lands reserved for Indians.” Mr. Justice Phelan's survey of usage of that word before and after Confederation is persuasive; in the Constitution, “Indian” is not a narrow technical term. The definition in the Indian Act is another matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That need not mean that the federal Parliament has to start madly churning out new statutes about the Métis and non-status Indians. It is not, however, simply a neutral event. If the legislative power over aboriginals is a federal one, then the corresponding Crown prerogative – an executive power – is conferred on the federal government, which, Mr. Justice Phelan says, must accept the obligations of the Royal Proclamation of 1763 to protect all Canadian aboriginals, and their rights to land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upshot is that the provinces are essentially not on the hook for land claims. It is not obvious what the duties of the federal government to the Métis and non-status Indians will turn out to be; after all, the Proclamation is almost 250 years old – issued by King George III in somewhat different circumstances from today's – and not easy to apply. This decision is likely to be appealed at least once; then more specific lawsuits may well follow. If Mr. Justice Phelan's reasons do stand, the federal government must think about what its obligations may be, but not rush into any ambitious new programs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Darnell, the president of alternative entertainment at the Fox network, does not look like a network TV executive. The 50-year-old is short, wiry, wears his dark curly hair shoulder length and is usually outfitted in a suede jacket, jeans and sneakers. Often he wears a cowboy hat.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor does he look like a man responsible for the decline of network television, but to some he is exactly that. The man behind such bizarre reality shows as Who Wants To Marry A Multi-Millionaire?, When Animals Attack! and Temptation Island has been called “Fox's point man for perversity” by the New York Times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On this day he's merely the exec responsible for American Idol. This week, the Idol bandwagon starts rolling again (Wednesday, Fox, CTV, 8 p.m.) for its 12th season. The success of Idol begat other singing and dancing competition shows on TV. Everything from The X-Factor to The Voice has come, stayed and keeps on going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Me, I wonder if there is any possibility that American Idol is just over? That it might end, and all the prattle about the judges might cease? A lot of people would like that to happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Darnell finds this amusing. The man responsible for Joe Millionaire is bound to have a peculiar sense of humour, one supposes. He smiles and says, “Look, not in my wildest dreams could I ever have imagined that we'd have a show go 11 years, going into its 12th, and still be the No. 1 entertainment show on television. No. That's incredible. And that's with all of the challengers and everything else on TV.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, it is pointed out, the viewing numbers are going down. “We're still doing numbers that, even as they go down, are enviable,” he says. “I don't see us living without [American Idol] for many years to come.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier, I'd witnessed the whole Idol circus – judges, producers and execs – arrive together at <span class="companylink">the Television Critics Association</span> winter press gathering here to promote the new season. One reason why Idol, which seems so old fashioned these days, keeps getting viewers is the attention paid to its judges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big story surrounding the new Idol season is, in fact, the judges. Randy Jackson is still there, like a relic of ancient times, and he's joined now by Mariah Carey, rapper Nicki Minaj and country crooner Keith Urban. Since this season of Idol went into production, there have been numerous reports of “cat-fighting” between Carey and Minaj, and a report that Carey had ordered extra security after Minaj got nasty with her. Some verbal jousting between the two was even caught on tape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was suggested to the circus members that the fuss “feels like it's fake.” The high-dudgeon rejection of this theory was priceless to behold. Executive producer Nigel Lythgoe adopted the air of a man accused of falsifying legal documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Whatever feuds there have been – and this isn't just between Nicki and Mariah but Keith and Randy as well – are genuine,” Lythgoe declared. “Whenever you're in this sort of passionate situation, these things happen.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that point, Darnell interjected to say “it's authentic,” and added: “There is passion in this group. They disagree about the talent, and the ways to approach the talent.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right, the talent! Those hopefuls who line up for hours, belt out their best songs for the judges and, if chosen, struggle to make the final rounds and, with luck, achieve singing stardom. They were rather forgotten in all the promotional giddiness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carey talked a lot about herself and occasionally glanced at Minaj, who, in turn, looked bored. Darnell looked vaguely amused throughout, but he kept a straight face when Carey said: “This is a passionate panel. There are a lot of strong personalities.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Watching this unfold, I had the feeling it was all as fake as the reported “cat-fighting” and felt in my gut that, since Simon Cowell left Idol, the show has struggled to hold viewer attention. And I suspected that the fuss about the in-fighting and feuding was orchestrated to keep alive the media attention. I felt that Darnell, the maestro of attention-grabbing reality TV, was pulling off an elaborate charade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I asked him if it was a concoction to get attention. The leaked video. The ostentatious frostiness between Carey and Minaj. “Well, no,” he said. “Something was probably leaked to TMZ, but we did not encourage it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure thing then. On Joe Millionaire it turned out that “Joe” wasn't a millionaire. On Who Wants to Marry A Multi-Millionaire? it turned the guy was neither nice nor that rich, really. But both shows got massive attention. American Idol is now on the same level of fakery. Look at the people involved and pulling the strings. I'm just saying.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There will be no shelter for the <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span>, not with a head coach who made clear on Sunday that much of this week will involve looking for people “who can step out of their comfort zone.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that there's a great deal of that commodity in these parts, anyhow. Seven seasons out of the playoffs and with the polarizing shadow of Brian Burke hanging over the team on this first day of formal practices, despite the fact Burke and his family were in Foxboro watching the New England Patriots AFC playoff game, it is time once again to begin battle with those old ghosts … 1967, and all that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burke yielded his commanding role on the local sports stage Saturday at high noon at the Air Canada Centre, and only fed the notion that the board of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, Ltd. looks about as misfit as some of the teams he foisted on the paying public in his four years as general manager. It was one last stir of the pot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For head coach Randy Carlyle, who may want to photocopy sheets with the statement “this is the hand we're dealt,” further indication that he'll be flying by the seat of his pants for much of the season came at 9 p.m. Saturday, when it was revealed that new collective agreement does not allow physical testing and practising on the same day. Scratch that Sunday schedule, then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We'll pick a day here – when we get a day – and there will be some form of testing done on the ice,” Carlyle said. “Before it was done off ice – bikes, treadmills and what not – this time some tests will pertain to skating and exertion on the ice.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already miffed that rosters were not expanded beyond 23 players at least initially, Carlyle also said he wanted the Leafs to get some practice time at the Air Canada Centre before going to the Bell Centre in Montreal for Saturday's opener, reasoning that practising in an environment that replicates the heat and feel of an NHL arena would better acclimate his players than the Mastercard Centre for Hockey Excellence in a Toronto suburb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now the focus has shifted. At his news conference, Burke said he still believed in James Reimer (“I believe I'll be borne out on that one,” he said,) thanked his captain, Dion Phaneuf, and all that did was call into focus two of the players with the smallest comfort zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phaneuf now wears the ‘C' like some kind of scarlet letter. He was Burke's hand-picked captain, and it has not always been a cozy fit, has it? If you're Reimer and Phaneuf, you probably wished that Burke wouldn't have mentioned your name. Still, Phaneuf said Sunday that “I feel comfortable in this role.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burke sounded more like a politician resigning from a race on Saturday, stating unequivocally that he still wants to be a GM – you have all been warned – but that after being fired from his last two jobs after an ownership change he needs to do a better job of picking teams. He said that had the Leafs won more games, “I wouldn't be standing in front of you today,” and then gently fed into the perception created by his media allies that he was a man wronged by the new board of MLSE.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burke's news conference at the Air Canada Centre was a stringing together of “yeah, buts.” He was not given a satisfactory reason for the timing of the announcement, he said, while reacting strongly to suggestions he was fired because of off-ice personal issues or issues with new members of the board, amid continuing suggestions that he and George Cope, the chief executive officer of BCE Inc., who now sits on the board of MLSE, had severe stylistic differences. If personality was an issue, it was an issue because of his record, he said. In Burke's words: “You can be as obnoxious as you want if you are in first place.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burke was effusive in his praise of board chairman Larry Tanenbaum and Dale Lastman – holdovers from the board that hired him – while suggesting he had been misled about his role as a senior adviser. “I was informed Friday that the adviser's role was to the board and Tom (Anselmi, MLSE's chief operating officer) and not to hockey operations. That was not my understanding (on Wednesday.) My understanding is the board wants a little more distance, and that's fine. They're entitled to it. I asked Tom [Anselmi, on Saturday] morning, and he said we'll work through it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burke acknowledged that he needs to fit a fit for his “brand.” Join the club, then. Across the NHL, the process of determining round pegs and square holes has started in earnest.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you've vowed to lose weight this year, chances are you're off to a good start with two weeks of healthy eating and exercising under your belt, so to speak. And there's no reason to think you won't sail smoothly through the rest of the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, you're highly motivated and have started off strong with sensible goals and a realistic eating plan you can see yourself following long term.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, though, the stick-with-it part can become a struggle. As enthusiasm wanes and temptations pile up, it's easy to stray from your diet and, in due course, end up back at square one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this is the year, right? The year you're determined to make your weight goal a reality. And you can. The following strategies will help you stick to your eating plan and shed those unwanted pounds for good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plan ahead</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not being organized is a sure-fire way to sabotage your diet. If you come home from work, tired and hungry, to an empty fridge, chances are you'll order in, or graze your way through the evening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To stay on track during a busy week, plan your meals and snacks in advance. Batch cook on the weekend for easy lunches and dinners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avert hunger</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Letting yourself get overly hungry makes it all too easy to grab whatever food is nearby – and typically that's not an apple or carrot sticks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eat three well-balanced meals each day, starting with breakfast. Skipping breakfast or lunch – or eating too little early in the day – can trigger hunger and cravings later on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Include between-meal snacks to manage hunger and prevent bingeing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stay accountable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keep a food diary and list everything you eat and drink each day. Doing so will keep you committed and prevent mindless nibbling. If you prefer, use an app to keep your diet on track such as Calorie Counter, MyFitnessPal, Sparkpeople, Lose It! or MyNetDiary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people find it useful to report to a buddy on a similar mission – through e-mail, texting or by phone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weigh in weekly. Seeing progress on the scale motivates you to keep on going. Conversely, seeing an upward blip will force you to follow your plan more closely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reassess portion sizes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cutting portions is key to weight loss. And surprisingly, your appetite adjusts to smaller amounts of food.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since portion sizes can easily creep up over time, refresh your memory every so often by measuring your foods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Choose one vice</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Include one small treat to enjoy as you lose weight, be it a weekly dessert, a daily square of dark chocolate or French fries on Saturday. You don't need to deprive yourself in order to lose weight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forget ‘all-or-nothing'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you fall off plan – and you will, you're human – don't think it's a major setback. If you tell yourself it's okay to have slipped a little, you'll be amazed how easy it is to get back on track.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Author, journalist, Ojibway Wabasseemoong First Nation</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Court decision recognizing that Métis and non-status Indians in Canada are “Indians” under the Constitution Act had a lot of non-native Canadians scratching their heads. The question the ruling raised most was: What does it mean to be Indian in Canada today?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a heady question. It's one that will spark much debate and a likely appeal of that decision by the Harper government. The ruling could mean that Métis and non-status Indians are entitled to the same benefits as registered status Indians. Those benefits include some tax exemptions if living on a reserve, hunting and fishing rights, and some health and education benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's deeper than that. It goes way beyond a mere political grab bag of rights. It goes to the fundamental idea of Canada itself because, if the ruling stands, there will be 600,000 more Indians for the federal government to deal with. It means that the new “Indians” inherit the same struggles, frustrations and denials their status brothers and sisters have endured for some 140 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be Indian in Canada today means that one signatory to the nation-to-nation agreement that frames your life forgets that it's a treaty nation. Canada became that when it sought to bring the Indians into treaty. It entrenched itself historically when it signed those documents. Unfortunately, the years since have seen an ongoing denial of obligations and responsibilities under treaty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be Indian in Canada today is to see your children suffer. On reserves, in Métis communities and in the cities, aboriginal children go hungry, lack warm clothing and solid educational resources, die as infants at a rate two to four times the national average and endure immunization rates 20 times lower than the general population. They suffer because different orders of government dispute who's responsible to pay or provide for a service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be Indian in Canada today is to see youth languish in chronic unemployment and malaise, endure high rates of alcohol, drug and solvent abuse or die by suicide at a rate five to seven times higher than non-aboriginal youth. It is to see the future of your people fail to finish high school or get skills training; too often they become parents themselves at a frighteningly early age. This, despite Canada's being a signatory to <span class="companylink">the United Nations</span> Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be Indian in Canada today is to know that your women are likely to be victimized, murdered or go missing. It's to know that you may have to share a two-bedroom house with as many as 16 other people. It's the understanding that running water is a luxury or clean drinking water a rarity. It's the awareness that Canada has known about these grave issues for decades, but they still persist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be Indian in Canada today is to know that your people's part in the history of Canada isn't taught in schools. It's to know that, when we speak of our treaty rights, most of the country doesn't know what we speak of. It's to hear your spiritual connection to the land referred to as nothing but a “romanticized attachment” by educated journalists. It's to have your traditional role as a steward and protector of the land denounced summarily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the reality that greets Canada's new “Indians.” But there's more. To be Indian in Canada today is to stand in solidarity and equality with brothers and sisters across the country to say that we won't live this way any longer. It's to be part of a movement of people that says we won't idle any longer or wait for our chiefs to tell us when or where to move. It's to seek to enlighten our non-native neighbours to the truth of who we are, our history, rights and what we want.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be Indian in Canada today is to watch our youth and our women take to the forefront of this direct action and lead. It's to know that our future is secure so long as they continue to bring their energy and their vision to the attention of a nation that has never truly heard us before. It's to be galvanized. It's to be strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be Indian in Canada today is to learn from history so it's never repeated. It's to turn to our elders and wise ones for guidance in turbulent times. It's to be prayerful and gentle at the same time we are resolute and unwavering. It's to be a spiritual warrior in a quest for the greatest good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is what awaits the new “Indians.” I say welcome.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such a long time ago – and yet there is something about it that rings with familiarity today.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A man called Dennis Murphy says it was nothing more than a crazy notion that jumped into his head while on a flight to Los Angeles in 1970.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What about a new league? he wondered. One that could take on the NHL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He began talking up the crazy idea with others and they quickly came to the conclusion that the NHL could indeed be challenged. As Murphy told Ed Willes in The Rebel League: The Short and Unruly Life of the World Hockey Association, the Vancouver Province sportswriter's delightful 2004 book, “We felt their weakness was their arrogance and selfishness.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sound familiar?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The WHA was both a great success and a great failure, but it nonetheless changed the landscape of North American professional hockey forever – as much in Canada as in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, however, hockey is a global sport. And just as the WHA was entirely dismissed and ridiculed right up until Bobby Hull was handed that huge $1-million cheque in Winnipeg, so, too, has the Continental Hockey League (KHL) been considered nothing more than an annoying fly in a room where all entrances and exits are controlled by the NHL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The KHL came close to landing its very own Bobby Hull last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ilya Kovalchuk, who has had the misfortune to play in two markets – Atlanta and New Jersey – of limited hockey interest, is said to have given serious consideration to KHL overtures to bail on his <span class="companylink">New Jersey Devils</span> and stay with SKA St. Petersburg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Devils, he has now agreed to return to New Jersey for this truncated season of discontent, but before returning he and fellow Russian star Pavel Datsyuk insisted on sticking around for this past weekend's KHL all-star game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seems there is a certain amount of reluctance among Russian players to let go of something that has had more appeal to them than the NHL would care to consider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While hardly the star player Kovalchuk is, Nashville's Sergei Kostitsyn openly expressed his desire to stay on with Avangard Omsk. “I would be happy to stay until the end of the season if I could,” he said on the team's web site. “It's just turned out excellently for me here. The atmosphere's awesome, all the right conditions are there, the fans are unbelievable.” Other Russian players have apparently expressed similar views, praising their team, league and fans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most Western hockey fans think of the KHL as little more than an unhappy alternative for players locked out of the only league in which they could ever aspire to play. The North American small collective memory of “Russian hockey” runs from the dour, unsmiling robots and military oppression of '72 to the terrors of air travel today, starkly underlined by the tragic crash 16 months ago that wiped out the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The continuing shivers of that crash notwithstanding, it is important to know that Russia in 2013 is not the Soviet Union of 1981, which happened to be the only other time this sportswriter was there before the world junior championship decided earlier this month in Ufa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The memory from way back then is one of abject misery: unhappy people living in a darkened, dreary world where most spare time was spent lining up for goods often gone by the time you reached the counter of the precious few shops available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You could not call today's Russia “thoroughly modern.” You might, however, think of it as “overly modern.” The streets are overly lighted and overly filled with new cars – including BMWs, Lexus, Land Rovers. The shopping is sumptuous and flagrantly fashionable. The markets overflow with produce and flowers and variety. New, massive malls seem everywhere. Transportation on Aeroflot, the Russian airline that has previously been so damned, is the equal – comfortable Airbuses, good meals, friendly service new airports – of North American carriers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a country where there is ever-expanding disparity between the very rich and the very poor, it is grand indeed to be among the very rich – which is exactly where professional hockey players lie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rinks are modern, fans are fanatical and knowledgeable, as was shown each time the Russian juniors took to the ice in Ufa. If, as the criticism goes, some KHL rinks are half-filled, what then is the difference between that league and the NHL teams in Florida, Texas and elsewhere?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the quality of hockey, who can say? Where is that NHLer absolutely humiliating all opposition in the European leagues? Where, a prospective KHLer might well ask with a sigh of relief, are the NHL headhunters and enforcers? Being a star hockey player in your own country has its benefits, not the least being your own language and an absence of the sticky, rather racist NHL tags of “enigma” and “floater” and “non-team player.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for being branded greedy and slammed for a lack of respect for duly signed contracts, what is there to say about that at the end of this revolting and ridiculous NHL lockout?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps there remains a weakness in such arrogance and selfishness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It annoys some North American fans to think that Russians could stand among the game's greatest stars, but the facts are there for the checking. The current MVP of the NHL is Evgeni Malkin, the player voted most valuable by the players is Datsyuk. The most dynamic NHLer since the last lockout has been, undeniably, Alex Ovechkin. Ilya Kovalchuk is up there, too – if only he played in a market that noticed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They notice in Russia. And though it did not happen this year, the day is surely coming when a significant star decides to return home – or simply stay at home. And it may, just as Bobby Hull did more than 40 years ago, be the beginning of something the NHL will have to come to terms with – no matter how reluctant it might be to admit there might be real competition for the players it considers their very own.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of all the celebrity shindigs during awards season, the Golden Globe Awards is the one that is super-dumb and super-fun. Most awards events, lacking any importance outside of Hollywood and lacking the heft of prime-time TV network coverage, are things that people read about the next day. The big one, the Academy Awards, has become a long night of ponderous self-regard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Golden Globes has caught on as the must-see shindig – dumb, because it has no meaning except as an event (the idea that quality is accurately assessed by the 90 hacks of the Hollywood Foreign <span class="companylink">Press Association</span> (HFPA) is ludicrous) and fun, because it includes both TV and movies (which means viewers might actually have seen that nominated actor in more than a 30-second movie trailer on TV). It is, as the E! channel people declared at the start of the red-carpet coverage, “young, fun and cool.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the point, people – youth viewers for the TV event, not codgers. Oh sure, like the Academy Awards, it features an awful lot of women who appear be five inches wide and many, many men who appear to be engaged in a long-running homage to Liberace, but it rolls out as an unpretentious freaks-and-geeks show, not a ceaseless charade of pretense about the vital artistic merit of mostly mediocre movies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Usually, anyway. The 70th Golden Globes was fun for a while and then, like the Oscars, grew tedious because of an overdose of self-regard. Excuse me, but could anything be more fatuous than Jodie Foster marking her Cecil B. DeMille award by jawing on in some self-absorbed reverie about her privacy? Or could Anne Hathaway have been any more fake, actor-sincere by declaring, “Thank you for this blunt object that I will forever more use as a weapon against self-doubt.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Golden Globes show was hosted by Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, two creatures of television, both often super-funny in their work and, by reputation, super-nice. But by the time they appeared, many viewers had spent hours watching the frock-opera of the red-carpet coverage on the E! channel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That part of the thing began weirdly. Ryan Seacrest, a man whose ostentatious lack of personality guarantees a long career hosting these things, first declared, “Here's some exciting news – Taylor Swift is coming and she's only stopping by E!” Taylor Swift? Take that, thespians, writers and directors. The Popsicle side of country music is what matters at this thing. Young TV viewers know who she is, you see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There followed some highly enjoyable gawk-fest TV. Claire Danes, there because she was nominated for Homeland, appeared slightly deranged, indeed only slightly less so than her character, Carrie, on the show. She has apparently given birth recently, and that explained the fuss about her body size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was the joy of the shoe-camera, the manicure-camera and the question, “What's in your purse?” There was the moment when Seacrest asked Swift if she was, perhaps, uncomfortable writing a song that was not about herself. The answer, bravely declared, was “no.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, the awards show was on. There was a single, fine joke from Poehler: “I haven't really been following the controversy over Zero Dark Thirty, but when it comes to torture, I trust the lady who spent three years married to James Cameron.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maggie Smith got a deserved award for Downton Abbey, but couldn't be bothered to turn up. That was wise. She missed Kevin Costner being overly indulgent about the days when nobody knew him, and the standing ovation for Bill Clinton when he appeared to jaw on about the movie Lincoln, which only won one award and, frankly, sounds impossibly tedious. And the failure of the teleprompter for the best-TV-drama award and the groan-inducing speech by the HFPA head, one Aida Takla O'Reilly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lena Dunham won for Girls. That was nice. But why she was dressed up as a statue of Queen Victoria remains a mystery. A lot of it was a mystery, really. Especially why an event that used to be super-fun because it's super-dumb has become almost as no-fun as the Academy Awards.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you listened to Jodie Foster accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement at the Golden Globes on Sunday, you may have concluded that she was either retiring or dying, that her mother has dementia, and that she knows that you know she's gay. You would only be right about the second two; backstage, she refuted any idea she would stop acting, apparently surprised that people might have drawn that conclusion from her reference to perhaps never standing on a stage again. Fellow gay celebrity k.d. lang summarized many people's reaction when she simply tweeted “?” while actor Mel Gibson, a friend who Foster thanked, sat in the audience looking utterly confused.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After loudly proclaiming she is 50, Foster started with a dramatic build-up to a confession for which she said she would need some support … and then jokingly announced, “I'm single.” (In 2008, she separated from partner Cydney Bernard, who she also thanked. The couple have two sons, both of whom were present.) She then explained she had come out a thousand years ago when you just did that with friends and family, before she went on to mock the celebrity compulsion to mark every confession with a reality TV deal and a fragrance. A long-time prisoner of the so-called glass closet who has sometimes been criticized for not coming out publicly because it might damage her career, Foster was apparently telling us: “Of course I'm gay, but I am not going to be your role model or spokesperson.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If annoyingly oblique for a public speech, her remarks were surprisingly confessional for a star who has always guarded her privacy. It has to be remembered that Foster has seen the darkest side of celebrity: In 1981, when the former child star was an undergraduate at Yale, she was stalked by John Hinckley Jr., an obsessive fan who made an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan in a bid to get her attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foster has good reason to be paranoid about her own privacy and dismissive of colleagues who cash in on theirs; she has a right to be quietly gay, so there was a certain irony to her attention-getting remarks Sunday. If you really are just trying to lead a normal life as a regular working thesp of whatever sexual orientation, why not thank your agent, publicist, mother and kids, graciously acknowledge the industry and the organizers, and hand back the microphone? The Golden Globes are notorious for recognizing popular if not always critically acclaimed performances and indulging celebrities who agree to appear. One suspects that had this been Oscar night, the music would have come up long before Foster had finished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, apparently, Foster at 50 has things she needs to get off her chest and the Cecil B. DeMille Award provided the opportunity as it recognized a polarizing and often contradictory career. Foster's few great performances – as a child prostitute in Taxi Driver in 1976, as an FBI agent stalking a psychopath in Silence of the Lambs in 1991 – and her sometime success as a director live alongside many, many forgettable roles in everything from the <span class="companylink">Disney</span> movies of her youth to the dramas and comedies of her adult career. She is, indeed, a working actor – a highly successful and rather famous working actor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was hearty applause when Foster made her pitch for privacy but how many of those stars clapping would give up all the mansions, the holidays, the cars and the clothes in exchange for fewer encounters with paparazzi? And how many lesser lights would kill – or at least agree to a sleazy reality show – in exchange for Foster's fame not because they want to fend off paparazzi every day but because they want recognition for their professional achievements?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Being a successful movie actor entails a willingness to be a publicly recognizable figure, not simply because that helps sell movie tickets but also because the magic of performance involves letting an audience identify with the person they believe to be you. That belief, especially if the actor is cast in romantic roles, may be overwhelmingly heterosexual, putting the gay actor in an uncomfortable position. Still, the days of studio-mandated public heterosexuality are long gone. Foster has been one of the lucky ones, who recovered from the horror of Hinckley's attention, built an adult career after Taxi Driver and managed to have a solid private life while maintaining a positive public image. She was negotiating this awkward territory rather well – until Sunday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I would never spend my hard-earned dollars buying a latte from a coffee chain.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Have you tasted those things? They're basically a cup of hot milk, with hardly any espresso flavour. Yuck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wouldn't buy a latte, but you go right ahead. Lattes are possibly the most unjustly persecuted luxury item on Earth. It's as if buying them on a regular basis is the perfect metaphor for the excessive consumption that has left us with record high levels of household debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you listed all the reasons for high debt levels and low savings rates, lattes would rank closer to the bottom than the top. It's understandable why the emphasis on saving more focuses on small things such as lattes, though. Small things are easier to control and less painful to sacrifice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It can't hurt to be more frugal with your day-to-day spending, and it might even be trendy in a contrary sort of way. But if you want to make a real difference in your personal balance sheet, you need to think big. Houses and cars: These are the purchases that keep you from saving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No, I'm not telling you to stop buying houses and cars so you can save more. My message is that spending less on massive purchases – and thus borrowing less – will leave you with enough money to save, and to afford small luxuries such as lattes, dinners at nice restaurants now and then, a good bottle of booze and whatever else turns your crank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our problem is that we take out mortgages and car loans and then see how much money we have left to save. But if you combine the cost of financing a home and one or two cars, there isn't much left for many families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A standard affordability measure used by lenders is called the total debt service ratio. The TDS compares your monthly mortgage costs, property taxes, heating bill and all other loan payments against your gross income. If your TDS comes in at 40 per cent or less, you're golden in your lender's eyes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's play around with the TDS and say you're in good shape to borrow if your mortgage, housing costs and other debts, plus a savings commitment of 10 per cent of your paycheque combine to account for less than 40 per cent of your gross income. If it were me, I'd probably try for 30 to 35 per cent, but never mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding a savings component to to the affordability picture will reduce your buying power in the housing market. In Toronto or Vancouver, you might be priced out of the market altogether. But if you can't buy a home and keep up a decent level of savings, then you can't actually afford the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason people often ignore this point is they've bought into the idea that housing is, at best, a good investment and, at worst, a forced savings plan. A house can be both those things, but mostly it's a forced spending plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I say this as the owner of a home where one of the bathrooms is being repaired and renovated after long years of wear and tear. In the past five or so years, we've also put a new roof on and fixed up the kitchen. Next up: rebuild the driveway. It never ends when you own a home. So if you expect to buy as nice of a house as you can afford, don't plan on having money left over for a proper level of saving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cars worsen the savings crunch caused by mortgage payments and other housing costs. It's laughable for families with two car payments to think that small measures such as cutting lattes will make a difference. Sell a car, enjoy the lattes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending less on cars is easy. You can buy a used one, or you can take advantage of the wide range of models and prices available. Instead of looking for ways to move up to a higher model, move down a notch or two and save some money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing is tougher. You'll almost immediately feel pressure to increase whatever spending limit you decide on when you start your search for a home. Resist it. What you sacrifice in the number of bedrooms you get will be more than offset by the flexibility you have to pay your mortgage, save sufficiently and enjoy life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for lattes, try a macchiato instead. It's cheaper, and you can actually taste the coffee.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSE AFFORDABILITY: HOW TO SAVE BIG</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can try saving on the little things, or you can look at the big picture. One way to do that is to change your view of how much house you can afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How It's Done Now …</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gauge used is the Total Debt Service Ratio (TDS):</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever since Ricky Gervais took over the hosting of the Golden Globes in 2010, the show's been revitalized as a bratty, nose-thumbing version of its self-important big Oscar sibling, a feat continued this year by former Saturday Night Live stars Tina Fey and Amy Poehler as hosts. But did Sunday's mock-Oscars really offer any insight into next month's Academy Awards results?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In truth, the Golden Globes gave almost no hint of how the Oscars will play out. The one-two punch of Ben Affleck's crowd-pleasing Argo wins for best director and best picture, for example, is probably not a predictor of Oscar victory. (Affleck was snubbed by Oscar in the best-director category.) The fewer than 90 foreign journalists in the Hollywood Foreign <span class="companylink">Press Association</span> who vote for the Golden Globes have no overlap with the 6,000 members of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences who decide the Oscars. And historically the HFPA's tastes tend to be more populist than the more highbrow Academy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only twice in the past eight years have the HFPA and AMPAS even agreed on best picture, though the Globes, which award two best-picture prizes, one for comedy/music and one for drama, have two chances to coincide with the Oscars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As well this year, the folks who put on the Oscars made a move that sidelined the Golden Globes even further in terms of influence. The Academy announced its nominations earlier than usual, three days before Sunday night's Golden Globes, which some pundits have claimed was Oscar's way of grabbing the Globes' media spotlight and refuting any claims that HFPA influences Oscar nominations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The organizations also have very different cultures. The HFPA journalists have a reputation of being more celebrity-struck than the Academy, which means a prestige indie film such as Beasts of the Southern Wild, which featured no stars, was off the Golden Globe voters' radar, but still may do well on Oscar night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, given that HFPA voters write for foreign publications, a quintessentially American film such as Lincoln could not have been expected to get the same support as it will get from the Academy on Feb. 24. Lincoln took only one of its seven Golden Globe nominations – Daniel Day-Lewis won best actor, drama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the example of Lincoln underscores what the Golden Globes can do to give a film profile even if it doesn't win prizes. Having former U.S. president Bill Clinton on hand to offer his personal endorsement for “this brilliant film” that “gives us hope that we can do it again” is as strong a validation as Lincoln could hope for heading into the Oscar race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Golden Globe speeches couldn't tilt Oscar nomination chances this year, generous or moving turns should leave Academy members well-disposed toward some of the favourites. Jennifer Lawrence, one of the best-actress Oscar favourites for Silver Linings Playbook, did nothing to hurt her chances with her charming acceptance speech as best actress in a musical/comedy for the same film, as she continues to define herself as this generation's Diane Keaton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Oscars, she'll be up against Jessica Chastain, who won the best actress in a drama prize Sunday for her role in Zero Dark Thirty. Her speech emphasized the links between the CIA agent she played and director Kathryn Bigelow as an outsider in a man's world. Oscar voters didn't give Bigelow a directing nomination. Arguably, Chastain's speech could indicate a push for a compensating best-picture vote for the spurned filmmaker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actors Hugh Jackman (Les Misérables) and Day-Lewis (Lincoln) each could declare themselves best-actor winners Sunday night in separate drama and music-comedy categories, but on Feb. 24, only one will take home the important prize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Oscars' best-supporting-actress favourite, Anne Hathaway, showed class by saluting her older rival for the Oscar prize, Sally Field, who plays Mary Todd Lincoln in the film Lincoln.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, from a filmgoer's perspective, the 2013 Golden Globes will be remembered as the year that Affleck got a nice consolation prize, and that Bill Clinton gave a big political endorsement to Lincoln for the Oscar race.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A marriage's validity depends on the law of the country in which the couple were wed, the justice department argues. That is the same principle the justice department cited last year in a different case. When it did so the first time, Justice Minister Rob Nicholson backed away publicly from the government's arguments in court, and expressly committed the government to standing up for gay marriage. So what happened?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new case involved two Canadian citizens who formed a civil partnership in the United Kingdom. The U.K. does not have gay marriage, but it deems civil partnership a parallel institution to marriage – “marriage in all but name,” as Ontario Superior Court Judge Ruth Mesbur describes it. It has all the same rights, all the same responsibilities. It even has the same rules for separation and divorce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet when the two men moved back to Toronto from the U.K., and one sought a divorce, Canada argued the two were not legally married, and therefore could not receive a divorce in Ontario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the same argument that Canada made – and Mr. Nicholson disavowed – in a separate case last January. In that case, two lesbians, one from England and one from Florida, had been married in Ontario. The <span class="companylink">Canadian justice department</span> argued that, because their marriage wasn't recognized back home, they weren't legally married, and therefore couldn't be divorced here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Madam Justice Mesbur was right to rule that the two men should be treated as married under Canadian law, and therefore able to divorce here. Canada is not obliged to accept discrimination in other countries. The opposite should be true – it is obliged to defend constitutional rights in Canadian courtrooms. No principle of international law should ever trump Canadians' right to sit anywhere they want on a Canadian bus. The <span class="companylink">Canadian justice department</span> should argue for Canadian justice.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By latest count, Toronto's skyline boasts 185 construction cranes. That is good news for the construction industry and good news for the city. “We have sucked up like a vortex all of the cranes in North America,” marvels Jennifer Keesmaat, the city's chief planner since September. Some whopping big projects are crossing her desk, including towers of 80 storeys or so.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We've started to see development proposals for what I've called super projects in the past that are beginning to come forward, putting a tremendous amount of density into certain areas, and I want to raise the flag that we need to think very, very carefully,” she said after a luncheon speech to the <span class="companylink">Toronto Board of Trade</span> on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not that she wants to slow development. All the high-rise projects are a direct result of city and provincial planning policies designed to fight sprawl and encourage urban “intensification.” In fact, 84 per cent of recent development in Toronto has been in places – like big intersections served by public transit – that are targeted as growth areas in the city's official plan. As a result, “We are starting to see a greater acceptability for a more intensified form of living,” Ms. Keesmaat said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's just that she wants to spread the wealth a little. The way she sees it, Toronto should try harder to shift some of the growth away from dense high-rise nodes and encourage mid-rise development along big avenues such as St. Clair and Eglinton. “We need to recognize that we have a tremendous amount of capacity throughout the rest of this city, which means we don't have to shove all of our density on one site.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Avenues, as planners call them, are crying out for more development. Many are served by streetcars, buses or other transit. One of them, Eglinton, is to get a new light-rail line, part of it running underground. The Avenues usually have lots of shopping and good access to local parks and community centres. Development there is “not quite as a dramatic” as all the glass condo towers in the sky, Ms. Keesmaat said, but “it can be a great way to build out communities” and revitalize streets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is how to make it happen. Planners have been trying for years to build density on the Avenues. Developers often find it hard to assemble significant parcels of land on streets with many different building owners. Architects find it hard to build modest-sized buildings given the welter of city design and engineering rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Keesmaat said she wants to make it easier and that it is one of her priorities for the new year. Among the ideas being considered is allowing mid-rise development on the Avenues “as of right” – in other words, without the hassle of applying for a zoning change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another problem she will have to overcome is public opposition. Although you might expect a modest mid-rise condo of six or eight storeys to attract less controversy than a mammoth tower, in fact, some local residents often fight even these projects. Proposed condos on Ossington Avenue and Queen Street East, among other places, have run into opposition from residents who fear they will bring congestion and change the character of the neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have a very clear framework,” Ms. Keesmaat rejoined. “If some people don't like that, there is not much we can do about that.” She hopes the city will come around to seeing the merit of developing the Avenues. “We have the opportunity to absorb and accommodate a significant amount of density in mid-rise forms in a non-onerous way that results in a very high quality of life,” she said in her speech.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Great density is coming to Toronto, like it or not. Population growth demands it. Planning policy is encouraging it. Might as well spread some of it to the Avenues.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike their rising stars to the north, where the excitement surrounding the youthful <span class="companylink">Edmonton Oilers</span> is palpable and maybe even beyond rational exuberance, the <span class="companylink">Calgary Flames</span> come into the shortened 2012-13 season dealing with the lowest of outside expectations. Sports oddsmakers have installed them as 50-1 long-shots to win the Stanley Cup and only three teams – the <span class="companylink">Columbus Blue Jackets</span>, the <span class="companylink">New York Islanders</span> and the <span class="companylink">Winnipeg Jets</span> – face longer odds.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their captain, Jarome Iginla, is – after all – a notorious slow starter, in a transitional year in which his contract is set to expire and nursing a minor groin pull. The player they signed to step in as their No. 1 centre, free-agent Roman Cervenka, is sidelined indefinitely with a blood clot is in his leg. Their newest sniper up front, Jiri Hudler, reported for duty Monday, and then informed the team he had to go back to the Czech Republic to deal with an illness to his father. There is a new coach, Bob Hartley, who could have used a real training camp to teach his systems and theories to the team, instead of having to introduce them on the fly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around the NHL, all those early complications make the Flames an easy team to dismiss. People wonder: How can they possibly succeed when their best-laid off-season plans seem to have already been undermined by the timing of the lockout and now Cervenka's injury?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a team, Calgary finds itself in that unsexy middle of the pack, a no-man's land that nobody wants to inhabit. For three years in a row now, they have been unable to get a playoff spot and for the four years before that, they lost in the first round. The Flames are never really terrible. They never had fewer than 90 points in any season between the last two lockouts, a standard that only the <span class="companylink">Detroit Red Wings</span> and the <span class="companylink">San Jose Sharks</span> also achieved in those same seven seasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is they are never really good enough to excite anyone either – and that is an issue. While just all the contenders now went back to the starting blocks at some stage in their development, the Flames are just steady as she goes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's doesn't make for a great marketing slogan, does it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're gonna be – you know – all right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are a veteran team that looked stale at times last year, and yet they have a decent complement of forwards (Iginla, Alex Tanguay, Michael Cammalleri), plus three defencemen perfectly suited to take advantage of any post-lockout obstruction crackdown that they come (Mark Giordano, Jay Bouwmeester and Dennis Wideman) plus a stellar goalie in Miikka Kiprusoff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, they are not as bad as the public perception of them seems to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You hear it,” said Cammalleri. “We're all fans of the game. I turn on the sports channels at night. Does it bother you? No. On a personal level, anybody who's got to this level in their careers has probably had a lot of people tell them what they couldn't do at some point or other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Really, what it comes to do is, the experts and fans can make whatever predictions they want, but the bottom line is, this is the consummate team sport. So it's a matter of, ‘how good a team can you become?' not ‘how good do you look on paper?' I truly believe that. So saying that, we have just as good a chance as anybody, and anybody has just as good a chance as us.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tanguay, who is playing centre in Cervenka's absence, has had two productive years since returning to Calgary. Cammalleri, another repatriation project, had 19 points in 28 games after coming over mid-season from the <span class="companylink">Montreal Canadiens</span>. In his last full season with the Flames, Cammalleri scored 39 goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a veteran team, the lack of pressure may be just what they need to succeed, where in other years they've fallen short.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Sometimes, the teams that have a lot of pressure on themselves, it can wear on them,” said Giordano, who pointed out that the Flames have one secret weapon, Kiprusoff's goaltending, that sometimes gets curiously overlooked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If we make playoffs, I think he definitely gets considered for the Vézina,” said Giordano. “He was great all of last year – our most consistent player and our best player most nights. I don't know if people just expect that from him. That's part of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The other part is, we have to get into the playoffs. When teams get in the playoffs, that's where most of the recognition comes from.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Hartley noted Monday, in off-season interviews with the team's veteran players, he heard one word – redemption – over and over again from the mainstays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Three years without playoffs is a very long time,” said Hartley. “I told the players, whatever you've accomplished as a team, it wasn't good enough. The passing grade in the NHL is to be in the playoffs – and it's quite difficult. I learned this in Atlanta. To be a playoff team, nobody makes you gifts. You have to earn your spot to the big dance.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sept. 6, 1991, The Globe and Mail published a sensational scoop. At 71, Pierre Trudeau had secretly fathered a baby girl, named Sarah. The mother was a constitutional lawyer named Deborah Coyne, 36. The Globe and Mail had unearthed the baptismal record, but both refused to comment. “I never talk about my private life in public,” Ms. Coyne said.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next day, the paper ran a legendary editorial cartoon. In it, Mr. Trudeau is dining alone at a restaurant. An ancient geezer points to him and tells the waiter, “I'll have what he's having.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trudeau's ghost looms large in the current Liberal leadership race. Justin, his son, is the front-runner. Deborah is running, too, although nobody can figure out why. She's never held elected office and doesn't have a hope of winning. Politics makes strange bedfellows, indeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To introduce herself to the public, Deborah has changed her mind about her private life. She has written an e-book, Unscripted: A Life Devoted to Building a Better Canada. Sandwiched between the dry bread of policy is her account of her life with (and mostly without) Pierre. She is very, very clear that she doesn't want or need your sympathy. But it's a heartbreaking read.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deborah was nothing like the women Pierre preferred (gorgeous, lively, artistic and unstable). She was a smart, earnest policy wonk – the daughter of old family friends. The seduction began when she sent him a paper she had written on North-South relations, and he invited her to lunch. More lunches followed. They talked about the patriation debate. She felt she'd met her “kindred spirit.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One day, she told him she wanted to get romantically involved. He agreed – but only on his terms. “I would have settled down with Pierre, even married him, but he had a life that involved both numerous public commitments, even at that later stage of his life, and his family. He wasn't prepared to commit to anything. He made it clear from the beginning that the boys were his first priority and that remarriage was out of the question.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus began her 15 years on the margins of his busy, busy life. When she got pregnant, he again made it clear that she was on her own. “Pierre was not prepared to take any sort of active role in bringing up a small child,” she says. “He chose to play the role of a distant uncle.” At one point, she thought of taking a job in Montreal, where he lived, but he discouraged her. “He stressed that Sarah and I wouldn't be able to just come by his home any time we wanted to.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flat, matter-of-fact tone conceals a world of hurt. After that conversation, she began “distancing” herself from him. When Pierre died in 2000, she and Sarah walked a few steps behind Margaret and the boys. They were the shadow family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deborah gave up a fledgling career in politics when she fell in love with Pierre. Later, she ran against Jack Layton for a federal seat, but lost. She never ran again, until now. Did she fall in love with Pierre because she worshipped him? Or because she wanted to be him? When intellectual younger women fall in love with much older, brilliant men, it's sometimes hard to tell the difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deborah doesn't say anything about her relationship with Justin, who was 19 when his half-sister was born. You can't imagine he and Deborah are close. They're temperamental opposites. She has the gravitas and taste for policy he lacks. He has the charm and good looks. Neither can remotely fill the shoes of the giant who inspired them. I imagine that he haunts them still, and always will.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country's most famous hunger striker has declined to declare victory and moved the aspirational goal posts after successfully hijacking the Prime Minister's schedule. Canadians are divided as to whether she's another Mother Teresa or an incompetent small-town administrator on a highly publicized weight-loss program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Idle No More movement has seen demonstrations across the land, so far peaceful but with no sign of peaking. Yet the movement has no coherent program or leadership. Spokespeople demand a shifting grab bag of change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Indian establishment is fractured. The nominal leadership of the <span class="companylink">Assembly of First Nations</span> has met with the Prime Minister with no tangible results beyond national chief Shawn Atleo succumbing to exhaustion. Numerous other chiefs have rejected that process, challenging their elected leader and threatening serious civil disorder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treaty negotiations across the country are stalled. On-reserve poverty reigns despite immense public expenditure. Cries of “genocide” and “colonialism” rive the air. Topping it all, a federal judge has issued a ruling effectively doubling the number of legally recognized Indians in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How to parse these events?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Begin with Attawapiskat Chief Theresa Spence. Were her reserve truly a sovereign nation, it would be a failed state. The waste of money, inadequacies of governance and favouritism have been so clearly documented as now to be common parlance. Her people continue to suffer dreadfully and this must be addressed, but the chief herself is a spent force. The more forcefully the spotlight shines, the more rapidly her credibility will melt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Idle No More will have a similar transience. Did Occupy Wall Street make a difference? Sadly, no. The concerns of this movement are legitimate, too. But it shares Occupy's weaknesses: no coherent leadership, no defined program, no institutional continuity. It is just another demonstration of the power of social media. The only real question is whether true damage to persons, property or the economy is caused in the process, at which point sympathy will be lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which brings us to the chiefs. Idle No More is a direct cri de coeur, a commentary by ordinary Indian people on the legitimacy of their leaders. And on many reserves, that point is so well taken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All over the world, when you put large powers into the hands of small governments, you are looking for waste and corruption and extended family control using outside taxpayers' money. The average reserve population in Canada is well under 1,000, mostly young. If the Indian people had to rely only on their chiefs, they would be in trouble. Fortunately, they can also rely on a deep well of sympathy and concern among Canadians generally, which could be the key to eventual progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chiefs, through the AFN, have just released eight points of demand. Some are sensible, such as guarantees for ongoing high-level attention. This is essential. The problems are so deep and complex that they require sustained prime ministerial authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some are to be expected, such as the call for lots more money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some are half-right. One is the call for a school on every reserve. Of course, every child needs access to good schooling, and in isolated situations, it has to be on the reserve. But reserve schools as currently managed are a well-known betrayal of their children. They are interfered with politically and find staff almost impossible to keep. Outcomes are generally better at provincial schools. But when the government came up with a plan to create Indian-managed school boards to take the politics out of the existing situation, the chiefs shot it down, as they do with every perceived threat to their power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The AFN has also demanded resource sharing. Good idea, but it requires consent of the provinces, which own the resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the demands is nonsense. The idea of required consultation with Indians on government legislation that affects all Canadians equally cannot be taken seriously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some chiefs have threatened to blockade the country this week. This will not be progress. It will harm their cause and undermine the rule of law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so it goes. The judge's creation of about 600,000 new Indians will be appealed for years. In the end, even if jurisdiction is confirmed, it need not be exercised. (After all, thanks to not being Indians, Métis have done much better.) Although, you never know with this government – it is in the process of inventing as many as 70,000 new Indians in Newfoundland with a new annual medical and educational bill in the hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treaty negotiations? The situation is a disgrace. In British Columbia, 20 years and $1-billion in negotiating costs have produced exactly two new treaties, with maybe two or three more to come in the near term. And there are almost 200 B.C. bands. I have sat for almost four years on the Indian side of one of these tables and I can report that the governments (not their representatives at the table, who are powerless) are negotiating in bad faith.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is the way out?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, unless the Prime Minister gets deeply involved, little progress will be made. The whole rotten system is suffering from a deficit of attention, imagination and determination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, we have spent way too much time and treasure on chiefs and not nearly enough on Indians. Send much less money to the chiefs and put it directly to individuals and families. Give individuals the resources for mobility: cash and education. Half of status Indians have already voted with their feet and left the reserves for a better life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third, pay the provinces to deliver the social programs, such as health and welfare, that they deliver reasonably well for the rest of us. Take the management away from Indian Affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upon every confused sea, a sailor needs a guiding star. The individual is the fixed point here. Follow that and we will make a safe harbour.</p>

While Mr. Justice Frank Marrocco accepted the evidence of the prosecution's own witnesses, he concluded that the successive interpretations of the company's results were all justifiable and made in good faith.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The death throes of Nortel diminished the savings of a huge number of Canadians, but that would be no justification to punish as criminal offenders Frank Dunn, the former president, and two senior finance executives, Douglas Beatty and Michael Gollogly, who appear to have been attempting, according to their lights, to rescue the company.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was not a case of a set of alternative, hidden, realistic books of account, as in the prosecution of Garth Drabinsky, the former CEO of Live Entertainment Corporation of Canada, Inc. On the contrary, the first revision of Nortel's financial statements was a corrective response to “worst-case scenario” conservatism that had been acted upon when the company had to make huge writeoffs, which later turned out to be excessive. But that conservatism had been legitimate at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The attribution of motives is a tricky matter. It is humanly understandable, but unwise (as well as ungenerous), to think that, if someone takes a course of action that increases his or her pay, the choice must have been self-interested. In the Nortel case, the more favourable results, under the company's policy, did result in larger bonuses for the defendants. Indeed, Mr. Gollogly, the former controller, drafted a letter in which he wondered whether he should accept the bonus, while the company was still struggling, but he never sent it. If all three had passed up the bonuses to which they were entitled, they would have spared themselves a great deal of grief. A two-month review by a Washington, D.C., law firm inferred that all three had been manipulative; they were dismissed, which brought about a final loss of confidence in Nortel on the financial markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nine-month trial, with hundreds of documents (the tip of an iceberg, from the 30 million pages in the hands of the RCMP), did not prove manipulation, let alone fraudulent motives. Mr. Justice Marrocco's cautious, thorough, 142-page review of the evidence is convincing. The moral of the story is that one should be slow to feel too sure of what goes on in other people's heads.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Harper holds a distinction no other prime minister can claim: No other PM has improved as much in successive elections as he and his Conservative Party.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After coming to office, most prime ministers see their seat numbers fall in subsequent campaigns. In his three victories, Mr. Harper has substantially improved his seat count each time. The only other prime minister to achieve this over three campaigns was Wilfrid Laurier in the elections of 1896, 1900 and 1904. His seat totals went from 117 to 128 to 137. But Mr. Harper's increases have been more impressive. He rose from 124 in 2006 to 143 in 2008 to 166 in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next week marks the seventh anniversary of his arrival in power and the odds are there will be quite a few more of them. Canadians have a habit of according their prime ministers long incumbencies. Four prime ministers – John A. Macdonald, Laurier, Mackenzie King and Pierre Trudeau – served more than 15 years. Several others served eight years or more: Robert Borden, Louis St. Laurent, Brian Mulroney and Jean Chrétien.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With still plenty of time in his current term, Mr. Harper will join the group of long-time tenants and it's even possible he will one day make the 15-year club. Opposition party members will quietly tell you that without amalgamation or a co-operation deal of some kind among progressive parties, the chances of unseating the Conservatives are small. Reducing them to a minority is well possible, they feel, but not throwing them out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key to longevity of our long-lasting leaders is to have circumstances beyond their control work in their favour. Mackenzie King lost two elections on the 1920s, but was saved by the Great Depression that sunk the Conservatives and ushered him back to power. A defeated and retired Pierre Trudeau was resurrected by the freak accident of the Tories self-destructing shortly after coming to power in 1979. Jean Chrétien had the good fortune of seeing his opposition divide itself into little pieces courtesy of the 1993 election. Stephen Harper was handed the sponsorship scandal, weak opposition leaders and so much vote-splitting on the left that, like Mr. Chrétien, winning was made easier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The skills of all these leaders should not be underestimated. But so much, here and everywhere in politics, is a matter of chance. If it had been Mitt Romney who got a momentum-turner late in the U.S. presidential campaign instead of the one given Barack Obama by Hurricane Sandy, the outcome might well have been different. In Antony Beevor's new book, The Second World War, he notes how Winston Churchill was dancing in the streets at the news of Pearl Harbor – the stroke of fortune for him that brought the United States full bore into the war. Without that and the other stroke, Hitler's force-depleting obsession with destroying the Soviet Union, how much of a hero would Winnie have become?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than by his decisions, good or bad, Mr. Harper's future will likely be determined by whether Providence continues to pivot in his favour. Currently, the country's political dynamic sets up splendidly for him. He can, strange as it seems, do poorly and still win. In the past year or more, he has dropped five or six points in the polls. The opposition parties, by contrast, have all had good years. The New Democrats elected a strong leader in Thomas Mulcair and maintained the new-found strength they gained in the 2011 election. Bob Rae kept the Liberals afloat and Justin Trudeau has set their hopes ablaze. The Bloc Québécois got back on its feet in 2011. The Greens showed they aren't going away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Normally such developments would be a source of worry to the incumbent. But Mr. Harper finds himself relatively unthreatened. His opponents are dividing up the vote among themselves all the more. It is by way of these kinds of twists of fate that members of our club of longest-serving prime ministers are made.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">W.L. Mackenzie King and the Liberals won fewer seats than the Conservatives in the October, 1925 election, but remained in power for eight months and subsequently won the September, 1926 election. On Tuesday, he was incorrectly described as having lost two elections in the 1920s.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contributions of $25,000 from the <span class="companylink">Insurance Bureau of Canada</span> to each of the front-runners to become the next premier at a time when auto insurance rates are a subject of debate. A whopping $50,000 from a single firm to a suburban candidate whose campaign is largely being funded by the construction industry. A $20,000 donation from a numbered company belonging to a businessman with ties to the gaming industry to an MPP who has since abandoned his candidacy but could have a say over casino plans in his downtown Toronto riding.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to what operatives in Ontario Liberal leadership camps call “the Wild West” – a contest in which the fundraising rules, or lack thereof, have allowed money to flow in a way that seems a throwback to a bygone era.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whereas federal election laws cap donations in the concurrent Liberal Party of Canada race at $1,100, there is no similar limit on how much any individual, business or union can contribute to a leadership candidate in Ontario, nor have the Liberals taken it upon themselves to impose one. In theory, a candidate could be funded entirely by one backer. And while nothing quite that drastic has happened, the money being thrown around is enough to underscore the need for provincial campaign-finance law to enter the 21st century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the eyebrow-raising donations may have perfectly innocuous explanations. Construction money being given to Mississauga MPP Charles Sousa, including the $50,000 from the Limen Group, might be chalked up to his enormous popularity in the Portuguese-Canadian community. Andrzej Kepinski has a history of making large donations to Toronto Centre Liberals, so interest in a downtown casino (of the sort he helped bring to Niagara Falls) may have nothing to do with that $20,000 he gave Glen Murray. Windsor's billionaire Zekelman brothers probably gave Sandra Pupatello a combined $50,000 just because she's one of their city's favourite daughters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others can't be as easily chalked up to mere goodwill. The <span class="companylink">Insurance Bureau</span> presumably did not give $25,000 to Ms. Pupatello and Kathleen Wynne, and $10,000 to Eric Hoskins, just because it thinks they're all swell candidates. The same goes for the donations of $20,000 each from the Federation of Rental-Housing Providers of Ontario to Ms. Pupatello, Ms. Wynne and Mr. Sousa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most candidates, these big donations pay the bills, with only Ms. Wynne appearing to have put together a broad fundraising network. As of the most recent disclosures – through a “real-time” system on the Elections Ontario website that, as of Tuesday, had not been updated in more than a week – her 250 contributors of between $100 and $500 were three times more than anyone else had. (Donations under $100 are not publicly reported.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no reason to believe any of the candidates have accepted even the biggest cheques with strings attached. But the fact is, their province and their party are playing with fire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Particularly when it is the leadership of a governing party being contested, even no-hope candidates might soon wield influence at the cabinet table. The lack of a donation limit allows contributors to do an end-run around campaign-finance laws that otherwise prevent them from giving more than $1,240 to an individual MPP's riding association, and an additional $1,240 to that MPP's re-election campaign, in any given year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also appears donors can indirectly provide more money to the <span class="companylink">Ontario Liberal Party</span> itself than the $9,300 that would otherwise be permitted annually. With leadership candidates having been asked to give 25 per cent of all money they raise back to the party, the Limen Group has effectively (if probably unknowingly) directed $12,500 to party coffers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario can hardly be called unique among provinces in maintaining such gaping holes in its campaign-finance framework. British Columbia, similarly, has no limit on leadership- campaign donations; Alberta has a $30,000 cap, which isn't much better. But Quebec recently imposed a somewhat extreme $500 cap, and Manitoba has a more moderate $3,000 one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In lieu of legal restraints, it's simply not realistic to expect candidates competing against one another during hurried campaigns to police themselves – something laid plain during Ontario's contest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only one of the candidates to have publicly expressed reservations about the lax rules, Gerard Kennedy, has publicly set a self-imposed $10,000 donation limit. But a look at his filings shows three donations of $5,000 each from Alpha Laboratories, Alpha HTN and Alpha Global iT – all of which appear to be related, though his campaign insists one of them is a separate company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard to blame the candidates themselves; such is the nature of playing in the Wild West. But before the next party leadership race in Ontario, the province should bring some law to it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the tired players left the ice, the fans were hanging over the railings holding out 50-per-cent-off souvenirs for them to sign.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expectations are huge. General manager Bryan Murray knows this – knows, as well, that Karlsson's personal expectations are just as huge as the city's – and tried to bring a little reality to the situation when he said, correctly, “This is a young player who is not going to win the Norris Trophy every year.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He will, however, have to play exceptionally well if the Senators are again to make the playoffs. “If we play well as a team,” captain Daniel Alfredsson said, “he's going to be great again.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so we return to Methot. People who understand that hockey is a smart team game that has the potential to release individual brilliance know that Karlsson needed Filip Kuba on the left side last season. The veteran Kuba, always perfectly positioned, smart and conservative with the puck, was the perfect partner for the freewheeling, unpredictable Karlsson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kuba, however, took his 36-year-old skills off to <span class="companylink">Florida Panthers</span> and a two-year $8-million (U.S.) deal, something the Senators had no interest in matching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They would, instead, go after Methot, a player they had long sought, and Methot would become Karlsson's anchor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Methot, the assignment was a thrill. “Any time you play with a guy like him,” he said. “I guess I shouldn't say ‘any time' as they're probably rare opportunities, but he can skate so well that when he does jump he's back right away. It's kind of refreshing to have that as a D partner out there. I know he'll be back despite maybe being the first guy up on the rush.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They began camp paired together and will certainly be paired together when the Senators open the season Saturday in Winnipeg against the Jets. There are no guarantees, however. While they have looked very good in practice, practice is practice for something quite different: real games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We'll see how it goes,” said Karlsson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Karlsson could be described as “wispy,” Methot is an imposing 6 foot 3, 224 pounds. He is quick for his size and plays safe with the puck. Whether he has the smooth skills of Kuba remains to be seen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he will also be expected to allow Karlsson space to work his magic, and that means a presence beyond what he can do by staying back or moving pucks out of his own end as quickly as possible. Karlsson began last season as an unknown, finished as a face and a name and an impressive trophy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He no longer has the help of anonymity and, as a known quantity, will be targeted for special attention by other teams. That will mean both a tighter watch on him and, given the way the NHL works, a lot of aggression directed his way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Methot knows. “Absolutely,” he said. “Am I a heavyweight? Absolutely not. I'm not known for fighting by any means, but I also know and recognize the player that he is, and I'm going to do everything I can to make sure no one touches him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A guy like him needs to be respected to a certain extent. You can't just run after him because he'll make you look stupid on the ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I know [Karlsson] can handle himself in terms of moving out there. But around the net, in the little scrums and so on, I think there's not only myself but a few other players who will be in there protecting him.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He's a bigger man than me,” Karlsson said with a laugh, “so he's going to have to be that guy.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The luxury real-estate market on Vancouver's tony west side has stubborn sellers bent on outwitting and outlasting picky buyers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For homes worth $5-million or more, patient sellers with money to burn are willing and able to wait for buyers with equally deep pockets to come along, even if it takes six to 24 months. “My clients want to sell at the right price. They don't have to sell unless they find the right buyer,” said Sydney Deng, a real estate agent with <span class="companylink">Royal Pacific Realty</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Point Grey neighbourhood on the west side, the 18 priciest listings this week range from $5.29-million to $13.898-million. On the University Endowment Lands, asking prices for nine top-tier listings range from $5.388-million to $23.8-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These high-end homes are so disconnected from the rest of the market, and there are relatively few sales in the luxury bracket,” said Dan Scarrow, vice-president of corporate strategy at <span class="companylink">Macdonald Realty Group</span>. His analysis of Metro Vancouver's most expensive houses shows a heavy concentration on the west side, where the wealthy remain rich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011, there were 691 homes in the Vancouver region that sold for $3-million or higher, including 142 properties for $5-million or more, according to <span class="companylink">Macdonald Realty</span>'s tally. This extreme high-end market barely saw any action in 2003, when there were 23 houses that fetched $3-million or more, with only two selling for $5-million or higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of posh houses sold cooled off 36 per cent last year, but the volume was still 17 per cent higher than in 2010. There were 439 homes that changed hands for $3-million or more in 2012, including 107 for at least $5-million. Some luxury properties recently fetched prices almost 10-per-cent lower than what they might have garnered during the market's peak in early 2012, but the high-end market is proving to be resilient so far. “It's not a traditional market because these are individuals with so much money that they buy things that they want. Most of these people will buy places with cash,” Mr. Scarrow said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa's tightening of mortgage borrowing rules last July didn't hurt the carriage trade, but restrictions on Canada's immigrant investors did put a damper on luxury properties. Vancouver is competing against New York, London and Sydney for the attention of buyers with roots in China, Mr. Scarrow said, noting that many wealthy individuals own several properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Deng represents the sellers at 4608 Northwest Marine Drive in Vancouver's Point Grey. Her clients are currently asking $13.898-million, down from the original $15.5-million in September of 2011, but higher than the temporarily reduced asking price of $12.98-million in March of 2012. The property sold for $6.98-million in 2009 and was assessed at $8.778-million on July 1, 2012. Ms. Deng points out renovations over the years to enhance the corner lot across from Locarno Beach. “It isn't very urgent for these kinds of sellers. They have the power to hold onto the property. It is for the right buyer who appreciates the mountain and water views,” Ms. Deng asserts. “Like art, it is hard to value. The assessed value is too low for a unique property.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite Vancouver's softened housing market, don't shed a tear just yet for elite homeowners. Of the top 12 highest assessed homes in British Columbia, 10 are on Vancouver's west side and the other two are in the municipality of West Vancouver, according to BC Assessment. Topping the list is 4707 Belmont Avenue, in Point Grey, with an assessed value of $39.27-million on July 1, 2012. Another property, at 4743 Belmont Ave., rounds out the dreamy dozen with an assessed value of $21.09-million. Ten of the top 12 have seen an increase in the latest assessed value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While high-end sellers are digging in their heels, buyers are being fussy. “It is hard to find the right house with a huge lot,” said Julia Lau, an agent with Homeland Realty. Ms. Lau represents a Chinese immigrant family seeking a home in the range of $20-million to $30-million, though no listings have struck the buyers' fancy yet. “They have the money, but I cannot find anything suitable for them,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Original asking prices for Vancouver's most expensive homes are sometimes millions of dollars over what they ultimately sell for – part of the psychological game by sellers to get on the radar of prospective buyers looking for the top 50 or 100 priciest listings, said Cameron Muir, chief economist at the <span class="companylink">B.C. Real Estate Association</span>. “The luxury market is more finite and there are a much smaller number of potential buyers. The uber rich can be fickle,” Mr. Muir said.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">–William Faulkner</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's easy to lose count of the breathless recent commentaries portraying aboriginal peoples as “divided.” Just last week, they say, aboriginal leaders failed to agree on whether and where to see the Prime Minister, whether to demand that the Governor-General be present, whether to embrace the Idle No More movement, whether to defy the law by blockading streets and rail lines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What else is new? But it's not just aboriginals divided this way. The last time anyone looked, Parliament was divided, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are always divisions between Ottawa and the provinces, and inside provinces themselves. In mainstream newspapers and electronic media, different voices expound on the issues of the day. From business lobbies to gay-rights advocates, from unions to dairy farmers, interest groups fight to protect their gains and, if possible, expand on them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as non-aboriginals disagree, so do aboriginals. The notion that some underlying unity of purpose and shared history exists among them is largely a myth – except for the almost universal experience of having been dispossessed and poorly treated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even that myth doesn't hold much with some aboriginal groups that have thrown off the history of dispossession, signed modern agreements with governments or otherwise just got on with building a better life for their people, such as the Cree in northern Quebec or British Columbia's Osoyoos, Musqueam or Westbank bands, among others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 600 chiefs select the grand chief of the <span class="companylink">Assembly of First Nations</span>. He or she is their spokesperson, but since the chiefs very seldom agree unanimously on much – just as in non-aboriginal society – the grand chief is on a short leash. No wonder the current grand chief, Shawn Atleo, has taken sick leave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A prime minister is surrounded by MPs and, in a looser sense, by party members across the country; a grand chief is surrounded by chiefs, who are leaders in and of themselves. Chiefs give orders; backbenchers take them. The difference is profound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is said that a few chiefs are corrupt, while others are incompetent. Has anyone read the news about the Quebec corruption inquiry, which has already toppled mayors and may yet shake the foundations of provincial politics? Toronto Mayor Rob Ford does not appear to be in any way corrupt, but neither does he appear very competent to run the country's largest city. He and Attawapiskat Chief Theresa Spence, heroes to their admirers, have much in common as administrators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are dozens of distinct linguistic and cultural groupings of Indians in Canada, with sub-units among groups, as with the six groups inside the Iroqouis Confederacy and the five within the Dene Nation. The Cree and Ojibwa are the most numerous; others have fewer than 1,000 people. Only a minority of Indians still speak their native languages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within these distinct linguistic and cultural groups, there are divisions upon divisions. Two bands, side-by-side, might take entirely different views. One will refuse to recognize Canadian sovereignty, the other will do so and deal with government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of 617 bands, according to the Indian Registry, 120 had more than 2,000 members, with the 20 largest having between 5,000 and 25,000. But 58 per cent had fewer than 1,000 people. And since almost half of band members on average live off-reserve, that leaves many on-reserve populations of just a few hundred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some will live near resources that can be extracted for profit; others have the misfortune to live nowhere near such resources. Some live close to mainstream society and can establish fruitful relations; others are so isolated as to make relations fleeting. About half now live in cities, with varying links back to the reserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many successful Indians in the arts, business, law, medicine, universities and other fields are proud of their heritages and retain links to their communities, but they have integrated to varying degrees in mainstream society and made their peace with this double existence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There will always therefore be divisions, just as there were long before “white” settlers arrived, Indian mythology to the contrary. Indians' sense of the past – the memories that animate their various actions today – will never go away.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I received a question recently from a reader who must remain nameless. I think you can appreciate the witness-protection imperative when you read the e-mail:</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Many of my friends make their own wine and I need a list of euphemistic adjectives to describe it,” he wrote. “I realize frank discussion could end the friendships (and future dinners) if I tell the truth. Criticizing your friends' wine is like criticizing their children. Help!!!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to my life. I have neighbours who make their own. Joe relies on imported California grapes. Eric gets Joe to crush a proud red from a decades-old concord-grape arbour that grows like something out of Jack and the Beanstalk over Eric's back porch. Both wines are surprisingly well-crafted, but the fruit is not exactly grand cru. I have to make excuses for why Château Joe doesn't meet the quality criteria to warrant a splashy column in The Globe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More frequently I find myself in the company of professionals whose juice isn't always up to snuff. So, I keep a handy mental glossary of polite wine-speak. Here's a list, followed by phrases winemakers themselves often use to cover for their mistakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assertive: A wine can, indeed, have too much flavour – bad flavour. This flexible catch-all covers everything from the foxy, wet-wool character of a red made from native North American vines (hello, concord) to the nail-polish fumes of a defect known as volatile acidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Food wine: Here's another versatile descriptor, but it's particularly apt for atrocities with a grip as bracing as battery acid. Nothing protects the taste buds, or tooth enamel, from oenological napalm like a hearty repast. Honourable mentions: vibrant, lively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Closed: All wine should taste of fruit. But some young reds can be so cloaked in astringent tannins that the fruitiness goes AWOL. It's not necessarily a defect, because the wine may eventually come around in the cellar. But it's hard to predict whether that's going to happen. In the meantime, you're safe with, “This strikes me as a bit closed. I think it needs time.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bold: Do you grow listless or drowsy after two sips of a syrupy shiraz, jammy zinfandel or high-alcohol New World pinot noir? You've just had a “bold” wine, my friend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toasty: Like all euphemisms, this can apply in a sincerely complimentary context, specifically with respect to good wines carrying a nuance of charred wood from barrel maturation. That's why a lumber-loving winemaker would blush to hear that his or her overoaked chardonnay is “toasty.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Layered: Complexity is the hallmark of fine wine. “Layered” is sufficiently vague to acquit you in any circumstance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ripe: Grapes should be ripe when harvested, so this word is flattering by definition. When grapes cross the line, though, and develop a cloying raisin-like character, you can diplomatically omit the prefix “over” from “overripe.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Great nose: Too bad about the taste.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And from the winemaker's PR phrasebook:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's an early-drinking vintage: Substitute “bad-weather” for “early-drinking” and you've nailed it. Wines from poor harvests don't cellar well. Drink up soon because this dog is going nowhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We picked before (or after) the rains: Autumn can be precarious in many vineyard regions, with precipitation that turns berries into water balloons with diluted flavour. No one picks when the skies of October turn gloomy – or at least no savvy marketer admits to doing so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't you love the matchstick?: No, I don't, at least not when it's highly pronounced. Sulphur compounds, either added as a preservative or produced naturally in tank or barrel through negligent practices, can get out of hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We use oak only as a seasoning: Many winemakers who rely on barrel aging trot out this cliché, even when the wine tastes like a two-by-four soaked in grape juice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The grapes were hand-picked: And I proofread my columns with a pencil. So what?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We farm biodynamically: Then I hope your wine will taste better when the moon is in the seventh house and Jupiter aligns with Mars. It's quaint to follow astrology and bury a cow horn in the vineyard, but if the guy down the road makes better cabernet than you at a cheaper price, he's got my patronage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our pinot noir vineyards are planted with the Dijon 777 clone: Maybe that's why I'm getting a note of hot mustard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This goes beautifully with sushi: So does pilsner. And a six-pack of Urquell is $20 cheaper than a bottle of your riesling.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During five years in minority government, Stephen Harper's Conservatives introduced 61 crime bills. In doing so, they successfully portrayed themselves as favouring harsh treatment for offenders. If “being tough” were all there was to criminal punishment, they would have been successful. But it isn't that simple.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most Canadians believe what the law has said for years: “A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.” But ensuring that this happens is not easy. In 2010, the Alberta Court of Appeal noted that judges sentencing identical cases would often hand down different sentences. When prison sentences are imposed, the portion of the time that is actually served in prison is not completely predictable. Many people think offenders will routinely be released on parole, although that isn't the case.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sentencing and release from prison, two parts of our punishment system, deserve thoughtful attention. Fixing the problems that exist in each will not be easy. But the Conservatives have systematically avoided addressing the difficult and real problems facing the criminal justice system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They recently announced that in 2013, they will employ the same tool that they have used since 2006 – a torque wrench – to “fix” another part of the criminal justice system. Their new fodder is the mentally ill. The government will tighten up sections of law that relate to those who are found not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the so-called fixes is just silly redundant rhetoric. The Minister of Justice has said he will make the safety of the public the “paramount consideration in the decision-making process involving mentally disordered accused persons.” Yet his own ministry's website concedes that the Supreme Court has already made clear that the “protection of society” is “paramount” in these cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make it look as if we will be safer from the mentally ill, they have searched and found something that they can tighten. Those deemed by juries or judges to be not criminally responsible because of mental illness are held in secure mental hospitals. A board, containing experts and receiving advice from a provincial Crown attorney, hears all relevant evidence. If they decide that the patient no longer poses a serious threat to society, they can release him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hearings now typically take place annually. So Mr. Harper's minister is recommending that reviews take place only every three years. It doesn't matter that it is in the public interest to release people when they can be safely released – not before, and not years after. It doesn't matter that the hospitals are full and that the costs of detaining these patients mean that services are not available for others who need them. Nor does it matter whether the patient has been successfully treated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Piecemeal “tightening” of provisions is all the government can do. Since 2006, the Conservatives have made scores of these changes, each adding incoherence to an already complex and somewhat incoherent system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, rather than consulting, considering and discussing with all interested parties how to ensure the effective reintegration into society of offenders sentenced to prison, the government simply abolished “accelerated parole review,” which allowed non-violent offenders serving their first penitentiary sentences to be fast-tracked for parole consideration. Instead of making sense of the complex and confusing ways in which offenders sent to prison serve their sentences, the government took the easy way out. They realized that they could score just as many political points simply by eliminating this provision. Truly fixing the problems would take consultation, thought and hard work. Apparently, that's not the Conservative way when it comes to criminal justice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the Conservatives introduced legislation to double and make mandatory victim surcharges – fines, essentially – on offenders, many of whom have no money to meet these new penalties. Does the government care that imposing a fine that can't be paid makes no sense?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, in 2013, unless Santa brought the Prime Minister a new tool, the same old torque wrench will be attached to other criminal justice provisions. Few people would go to a car mechanic whose only skill was using a torque wrench. But that is what Mr. Harper is doing with our criminal justice system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A criminal justice system that incarcerates a higher proportion of Canadians than it did in the past is not necessarily a better system, nor is the country safer because of it. When crime – including homicide – has been decreasing for more than 20 years, “tightening up” the system and forcing the provincial and federal governments to allocate more resources to lock up more Canadians is counterproductive. Canadians deserve more from a Prime Minister who claims to be committed to getting value for money.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it were only the targeting of children at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., last month, or of teens and young adults at a movie theatre in Aurora, Colo., last summer, the problem would be challenging enough. But it goes so much further. More than 3,000 people from birth to age 19 were killed by guns in 2007, a number equal to 150 Newtown massacres. It is the omnipresence of guns that poses countless dangers to children.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newtown is a community in which residents use automatic weapons in unlicensed shooting ranges near their homes. The 20-year-old killer, Adam Lanza, had an adolescence filled with the sound of explosions from powerful guns. His mother, with whom he lived, owned several guns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joseph Hall, of Riverside, Calif., was just 10 when he shot his neo-Nazi father dead with a .357 Magnum. His father beat him regularly, the judge said, as he found him guilty of second-degree murder. Why wasn't he protected from his father? Why was he allowed access to a gun? Now he faces a custodial sentence until 23. Why is he to blame, and not the society that failed to protect him?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These problems will need more than President Obama to solve them. They need brave local and state legislators to stand up to gun owners and the gun lobby. Much better identification of children at risk and mental-health treatment are needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, the National Rifle Association hypocritically introduced (after denouncing violent video games) a free, target-shooting app for mobile phones, rated as appropriate for age 12 and up. The goal is obvious – to normalize gun ownership for an entire generation. That is what Mr. Obama is up against.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question that he and all policy-makers will need to answer was put eloquently by David Wheeler, father of a murdered child in Newtown: “Ask yourself, what is it worth doing to keep your children safe?”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">French food is the cuisine of the new year. On a recent trip to Paris, I discovered that Parisian restaurants are producing exceptional dishes making brilliant use of technology while still keeping to the tenets of French cooking. With flavour bursting out all over, there is a freedom and playfulness in the dishes. We ate mostly at stylish bistros – gone are tablecloths, arrogant service and attitude in celebration of this neo-bistro movement.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voted by Restaurant Magazine as one of the 50 best restaurants in the world, Le Chateaubriand took my breath away. The movie star-handsome chef from Basque Country, Inaki Aizpitarte, creates imaginative, lusty, no-holds-barred dishes – all without any formal training. There was not a single similar taste throughout the five-course tasting menu and five amuse-bouche. His flavour pairings are inventive, exciting and sometimes just plain weird: raspberry juice to accompany seviche, shredded raw scallops with pomelo, and Jerusalem artichokes in a dessert. There is no end to his fevered imagination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incredible Agape Substance has Canadian connections. Part-owner Jean-Michel Centeno is the former owner of one of the first fine French restaurants in Toronto, Auberge Gavroche. Agape is small, with one table running down the centre and a few tables for two at the edges. They offer a tasting menu that varies depending on how much you want to spend, serving innovative, contemporary food that far exceeds your palate's expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The food from these restaurants is impossible to create at home, but here are two simpler recipes that we loved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE SOUP WITH SCALLOPS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arranging the garnish on the soup plate and pouring the liquid over top at the table is an easy, elegant way to serve this soup. It's inspired by the hearty food at Semilla, another modern bistro.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Prep time: 10 minutes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Ready in: 45 minutes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Serves: 4</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2 tablespoons butter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 cup chopped onion</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 tsp chopped garlic</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">500 g (1 lb) Jerusalem artichokes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks (about 3 cups)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">21/2 cups chicken stock</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1/3 cup whipping cream</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Salt and freshly ground pepper (preferably white pepper)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 tbsp olive oil</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4 jumbo scallops</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heat butter in a pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and sauté for 2 minutes or until softened. Add Jerusalem artichokes and sauté for 1 minute. Pour in stock and bring to a boil. Turn heat to low, cover and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes or until artichokes are very tender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purée soup using a hand-held blender or food processor until smooth. Return soup to pot, add cream and season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over high heat. Add scallops and sear 3 minutes or until deep brown. Turn over and then slide skillet off the heat, leaving scallops in the pan. Season with salt and pepper. Scallops need another 2 minutes to finish cooking but will also hold for another 5 minutes, if soup is not yet ready. Pour soup over plated scallops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CELERIAC ‘RISOTTO'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Le Comptoir has an intimate vibe and wonderfully tasty food on its set menu. The cheese tray alone is worth the visit. Chef Yves Camdeborde, a leader in the new bistro movement, served this as a luscious first course but it could also accompany a main. Pulse the celeriac in the food processor because you want it chopped like grains of rice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Prep time: 10 minutes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Ready in: 20 minutes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Serves: 4</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3 cups diced celeriac</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2 tbsp olive oil</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1/2 cup chopped onion</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Salt and freshly ground pepper</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3/4 cup chicken stock</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1/4 cup mascarpone</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2 tbsp chopped parsley</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 tbsp grated horseradish</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1/4 cup milk, warmed</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulse celeriac in a food processor until morsels are slightly larger than a piece of rice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heat oil in a pot over medium heat. Add onions and cook for 2 minutes. Add celeriac and cook for another minute. Season with salt and pepper. Add stock and let simmer until liquid has been absorbed and celeriac is tender-crisp, about 5 minutes. Add additional spoonfuls of stock if needed. Stir in mascarpone, parsley and Parmesan – the risotto will be saucy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beat together horseradish and milk with a hand blender until foamy. Serve risotto in soup plates and garnish with foam.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I suspect you'd want to underscore Lucy's enticing Parisian experience here with a French wine. In fact, a white Burgundy instantly crossed my mind and would make a fine Paris match for both dishes. Slightly creamy and often with an earthy mineral tang, France's finest chardonnays possess the texture and flavours to dance a pas de deux here. A simple and affordable Macon would be nice, though a higher-end Puligny-Montrachet or Meursault would give these dishes the regal touch. Non-French alternatives: Oregon or British Columbia pinot gris. If you prefer red, try an earthy red Burgundy (a.k.a. pinot noir), with its resonant root-vegetable beet note.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faced with an <span class="companylink">NHL</span> regular season 34 games shorter than the usual 82 after a rushed six days of training camp, the obvious consensus is the team with the most battle-ready players has the best chance of success.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But battle-ready means more than having the most players who spent the 113-day lockout skating in Europe or Russia or the minor leagues. It means having to make much fewer personnel changes than anyone else and having a coaching staff and its systems already entrenched, keeping everyone on the same page.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Playoffs are going to be won or lost by teams that are ready to go right at the start and teams that jell the quickest,” said <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span> winger Joffrey Lupul, whose team is not exactly in that comfort zone. (The Leafs are still trying to grasp the “200-foot game” preached by head coach Randy Carlyle, who arrived with 18 games left in the 2011-12 season.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With only 48 games to decide which 16 of 30 teams make the postseason, streaks – both winning and losing – will be magnified. A slow start because you added two new forwards to your top six and they didn't mesh immediately, or a five-game losing skid because your most important players are just not in game shape, will be deadly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think the team that is prepared to play strictly to their style, to their complete game,” Carlyle said, when asked what kind of team will have the advantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We give you, then, the <span class="companylink">Boston Bruins</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boston has exactly two vacancies on its roster – hot-shot rookie defenceman Dougie Hamilton is pencilled in for one, while the job on the third line is there to lose for Chris Bourque (son of Bruins legend Ray Bourque) – and a total of three personnel changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third change is definitely a positive. Fourth-year goaltender Tuukka Rask, who has already proved he can play (and play well) in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span> and spent the recent lockout in the Czech Republic, takes over for perennial dressing-room disruption Tim Thomas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruins head coach Claude Julien is entering his sixth season, and his defensive-slanted system is well-established.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even better, the Bruins had 10 players active in other leagues during the lockout, the most in the <span class="companylink">NHL</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Modern players are always in good physical shape, but there is still a difference between practice condition and game condition. This is not a question so much of age, either, but of hitting that slightly higher fitness level through high-level competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think it's certainly beneficial,” Bruins president Cam Neely told The Boston Globe. “Any time you can play hockey games and be in as close to game shape as possible, it's an advantage. So it's pretty simple.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Now having said that, that doesn't mean that other teams won't get ramped up quick. But I think it's certainly beneficial to us to have so many guys as we did playing hockey.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using the same theory, one team to watch is the defending Stanley Cup champion <span class="companylink">Los Angeles Kings</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They may not have had as many players active during the lockout but they are a young team with few personnel changes. They were quick studies when coach Darryl Sutter arrived with his system that blends defence and skill, and won a championship six months later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are injury questions around forward Anze Kopitar (knee) and goaltender Jonathan Quick, who had off-season back surgery to repair a herniated disc. But there is no reason to believe Quick will not continue his rise to superstardom and while Kopitar's absence is a blow, there is enough talent on the roster to compensate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you like the theory that young legs can be a wild card in a 48-game season, then take the <span class="companylink">Colorado Avalanche</span> as a dark horse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to youngsters such as Matt Duchene and Gabriel Landeskog, the Avs drew a lot of attention in the final half of last season. If goaltender Semyon Varlamov can finally develop some consistency, they could be a playoff force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, there is saying certain teams have an edge and there is doing, Caryle adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“On the outside, you would say the percentages give them something in their favour, but you have to go out and earn it,” the Leafs coach said. “It's like every year. We have predictions for teams who are going to finish from first to 30th. How many of those predictions come true?”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Up until now, the Idle No More movement hasn't sparked much attention in Quebec, apart from a small demonstration in Montreal of young Indians who chose their own emblem – a red feather that echoed the red square of last spring's student revolt. According to a recent CROP survey, more than three-quarters of Quebeckers hadn't even heard of the movement.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec's aboriginal chiefs, far from joining the angry chorus of their Ontario colleagues, have sided with Shawn Atleo, the pragmatic leader of the <span class="companylink">Assembly of First Nations</span>. Matthew Coon Come, the well-known Cree leader, and Ghislain Picard, the head of the province's first nations assembly, welcomed the opportunity to reopen “a meaningful political process” with Prime Minister Stephen Harper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the 1990 Oka crisis near Montreal was one of the worst standoffs between aboriginal militants and the authorities in Canada's recent history, Quebec has enjoyed, by and large, a more serene relationship with its aboriginal population than many other provinces. Contrary to the newer Western provinces, where many land claims haven't been settled, Quebec has had more than 400 years to work out relatively peaceful arrangements with its native minority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout history, there have been very few armed confrontations and a great deal of intermarriage, so that many families, especially in northern areas like the Saguenay, have Indian blood in their heritage, while most Quebec aboriginals, especially those who live off-reserve, are physically indistinguishable from the majority population because they all have “white” ancestors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Indian population in Quebec is very small: 1 per cent of the population, just over 80,000 people, of whom less than 20 per cent live on reserves. According to Réjean Morissette, a former civil servant who took part in the negotiations of the Quebec government with the James Bay Cree and worked for 10 years as a liaison officer between the government and the native reserves, Quebec's aboriginal people should be seen as “co-founders” rather than victims. In several publications, he debunks the “myth” that Indians were dispossessed of their land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apart from about a thousand Mohawks in the lower St. Lawrence Valley, he argues, “none of the 11 nations now recognized by the Quebec government had a significant, continued and organized presence” on Quebec's territory at the time of the first French explorers, in the mid-16th and the early 17th centuries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quite a few young Quebec Indians now refuse to play the “victim” card, such as Guillaume Picard, a Huron-Wendat who wrote in a letter to La Presse that Theresa Spence's record as Attawapiskat chief is a “shame,” and that young Indians are fed up with their image as “victims of colonialism or post-colonialism” and want to take their destiny into their own hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason for the relatively peaceful climate is that most Quebec reserves are economically well-off because they are located very close to cities that offer job and educational opportunities – the Mohawk reserves are near Montreal and the Huron-Wendat First Nation is a suburb of Quebec City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the far north of the province, peace was bought at a high price. In 2002, the James Bay Cree signed a celebrated treaty with the Parti Québécois government. In exchange for their land rights, they ended up with billions of dollars and a huge stake in the future development of Northern Quebec. Sadly, though, the Cree, while collectively rich, suffer from the woes of all isolated reserves, with many young people dropping out of school to face a future of unemployment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anticipating a tough slog for his new gun-control proposals in Congress, President Barack Obama is preparing to issue a series of executive orders to curb gun violence.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The executive actions would entail the stricter enforcement of existing gun laws, ordering better data collection on gun ownership and empowering the federal Center for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct research on the impact of guns in American society.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The executive push is part of a gun-control initiative Mr. Obama is set to unveil on Wednesday, barely a month after the massacre of 20 Connecticut schoolchildren sparked a rare collective soul-searching about the nation's gun culture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The President's proposals also include several controversial measures that require congressional approval, such as banning the sale of assault weapons, making background checks mandatory for all gun buyers and prohibiting high-capacity bullet clips. But their passage remains uncertain, with even Democrats expressing reservations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday that Mr. Obama's initiative, which the President will announce surrounded by children who wrote to him after the Newtown shooting, represents a “comprehensive approach” to preventing similar gun tragedies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is a simple fact that there are limits on what can be done within existing law,” Mr. Carney said. “Congress has to act.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If implemented, the proposals would end almost two decades of steadily weaker federal gun regulations. And their rapid formulation by a task force headed by Vice-President Joe Biden testifies to the widespread view that the White House has a narrow window while the Newtown massacre tops the national conversation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of Mr. Obama's proposals are likely to face entrenched opposition from Republicans and split Democrats. Even some gun-control advocates argue that the White House should seek a modest package of gun reforms that would stand a better chance of getting through Congress without inflaming the powerful gun lobby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed an enhanced assault-weapons ban for his state, passage of a federal ban on such military-style semi-automatic rifles – including the type used in the Newtown shooting – is seen as a long shot at best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Asking for an assault-weapons ban would be an absolute mistake because the administration knows they would never get it,” said John Hudak, a fellow at the <span class="companylink">Brookings Institution</span>, a centrist Washington-based think tank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, it remains to be seen how hard Mr. Obama will push for an assault-weapons ban, rather than emphasize measures that garner much broader public support. They include banning the sale of magazines holding more than 10 bullets and expanding the federal system of background checks to cover weapons sold privately and at gun shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debate over an assault-weapons ban, which is feverishly opposed by the <span class="companylink">National Rifle Association</span>, would draw attention away from potentially more effective gun-control measures that the NRA might not actively oppose, Mr. Hudak added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“On an issue that is as emotional and tricky as gun control, you have to be driven by the politics,” Mr. Hudak said in response to Mr. Obama's recent contention that his “starting point is not to worry about the politics.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the Newtown tragedy, Mr. Obama has reiterated his long-standing support for what he called a “meaningful” federal ban on the sale of assault weapons, a reference to the fact that gun manufacturers easily circumvented a ban that existed for 10 years until 2004 by adding or subtracting gun features.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If he fails to get a comprehensive ban through Congress, Mr. Obama could use his executive authority to ban the importation of assault weapons, including AK-47s. But any new ban would not affect the estimated three million assault weapons already in circulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's decision to take up gun control – an issue only Democrats in safe urban seats have dared broach in recent years – comes amid anecdotal evidence of surging gun sales and long lines at gun shows, where no background check is required to purchase a weapon.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government could have done a better job in preparing the country for news of Canada's involvement in Mali. However, it is hard to imagine reasonable objections to its loan of a C-17 Globemaster aircraft to aid a close ally with closely allied interests in preventing the spread of a virulent and cruel strain of Islamism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without France's intervention in Mali, a former French colony, Islamist forces appeared poised to overthrow the government in Bamako, and destabilize a region of Africa.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The existing government of Mali is not worthy, in itself, of such support. Despite recent claims by Canada and others that Mali is a successful democracy, it can only be deemed so by comparison with Zimbabwe and Congo. Even before a coup last year, it was a dysfunctional state tainted by corruption, and the current transitional government has done little to improve the situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor are the humanitarian benefits of the intervention – there will be a lot of people in northern Mali who get to keep their hands and other appendages as a result – likely to be enough to justify the use of fighter aircraft. The responsibility-to-protect doctrine does not cover run-of-the-mill barbarism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor is the protection of global cultural treasures at storied places like Timbuktu and Djenné, threatened with destruction by the Islamists, reason enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the foundation of the French mission is self-interest, and that is also the reason why Britain, the United States, Denmark and Canada are providing logistical or intelligence support to France. This is not a neo-colonial adventure or “crusader” intervention against a faith movement. It is a lucid and necessary response to the threat posed by al-Qaeda-linked Islamists who threaten to turn Mali into a base for jihadist attacks on Western countries and interests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Canadian troops or assets are to be deployed in conflict zones, Ottawa should consult the parliamentary opposition and brief all Canadians about its involvement. Abetting an aggression is not a matter that should be taken lightly, and the government should reflect on how its decision to intervene in Mali could have been more transparent and consultative. Only after some confusion and many questions did Prime Minister Stephen Harper eventually publicly define Canada's role, and say Canadians would be kept away from the fighting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is hard to imagine why Canada would not help France, and Mali, within the parameters Mr. Harper outlined.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two-thirds of the way through Alanis Obomsawin's new documentary on Attawapiskat, a young man named Wayne Fireman gives the filmmaker a tour of the shabby house where he lives with his four small children. Pieces of plywood and chipboard cover areas in the floor and walls where dampness from the subarctic muskeg has destroyed the original materials. The ceiling in his bedroom is burnt out from an electrical fire caused by leaks in the roof. His family is essentially camping in a condemned house in a bleak-looking northern community, but Fireman isn't thinking about leaving.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don't want to move to another town or other place,” he says quietly. “ I like living here. This is where my family, my mom and dad were brought up … I would love to live here if I could get a new house.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The comment sounds different now than it might have even when Obomsawin's camera came to visit, after Attawapiskat sprang into national consciousness 13 months ago. Back then, the Northern Ontario Cree community and its chief Theresa Spence were mostly portrayed as supplicants. Now, with the rise of the Idle No More movement, a different side of native Canada has marched into view – determined, not passive; insistent, not patient.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changing the angle of view is, of course, part of the point of the movement. Native people have seldom had much control over their role in the media landscape, which usually allows just two options: victim or warrior. The two were already latent in Edward S. Curtis's century-old photo portraits of native people, whose evident sense of identity was framed by the photographer's controlling belief that the world he was capturing with his lens – and in some cases, stage-managing – was about to be swept away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obomsawin's The People of the Kattawapiskak River is a timely update on some of the conditions that got us to the present situation, though the swift pace of recent events – Attawapiskat chief Theresa Spence's hunger strike, flash-mob demonstrations across Canada, road and railway blockades – make the 50-minute documentary feel like a time capsule from a more remote past. The energy and fervour of the protests come from a different place than the film's understated rhetoric, and its overall sense that although much should change for the people of Attawapiskat, probably nothing will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet you can see how Obomsawin has tried to break from the constraints of the victim/warrior option. It's not easy: Every time one of her subjects displays the cramped, unheated, temporary digs they're obliged to call home, the viewer's power to inspect eclipses the feeble agency of the viewed. But they're always given room to show some source of strength, in the children they cuddle, in Fireman's rootedness in place and family, in one elder's comment, as he stokes a wood stove made from an oil barrel, that he feels stronger when he goes into the woods. Rosie Koostachin lives in a tiny shed with no running water, but she emerges as a thoughtful leader who raises funds for the community and feeds others with game her husband brings home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Facts and figures are sprinkled in, about the cost of milk in Attawapiskat (over $9 a litre), about the De Beers Canada diamond mine that can dig up 600,000 karats a year on nearby native territory, and about how much reserve land Treaty No. 9, written in 1905-1906, sets out for the James Bay Cree: one square mile per family of five, Obomsawin says. (The treaty, however, says the land is “not to exceed” a square mile, slyly limiting the upper range but not the lower.) But Obomsawin's main objective is to make us see the people of Attawapiskat differently. The emphasis, ultimately, is not so much on looking as on listening – the first stage in changing the conversation, or in making one possible. Unease with what goes out through the usual media channels may have been a factor in last week's banning of a southern TV crew from the reserve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reigning caricature of the people and their town was burlesqued on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> this week as Ottawapiskat, a grossly dependent southern settlement with an over-reaching chief. “You can become the majority leader of #Ottawapiskat with only 33% of band members voting for you,” tweeted Anishinaabekwe/Nehayowak singer Tara Williamson. “#Ottawapiskat debt hovering around $600,000,000,000. Might be time for a third-party manager,” wrote Anishinaabe writer and academic Hayden King.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawapiskat is funny because we know so very much about our capital and its political chief. When that kind of distortion ceases to be funny is when it's projected on people who live in remote areas that most of us never see. Whatever Spence's shortcomings may be as a band manager, she has a knack for dramatic gestures that confuse the powerful. While they're regaining their composure, Obomsawin's film may help non-natives like me attain a better, fairer picture of aboriginal people.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driving into Lod, it's easy to forget that this ancient city that once sat at the intersection of the Cairo-Damascus and Jaffa-Jerusalem roads is located right in the middle of Israel.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the neighbourhoods, with their garbage-strewn dirt roads and slap-dash housing, look more like Gaza than the modern, well-kept Israeli communities just a few kilometres down Route 40 beside Ben Gurion International Airport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As well, the crime rate and high number of murders every year make Lod the most violent city in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Israelis prepare to vote in their Jan. 22 election, these are among the kind of issues that matter most to the electorate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problems that plague many of Israel's mixed Jewish-Arab communities – cities such as nearby Ramleh, Jaffa and Akko – are felt most acutely in Lod, where Jews account for about 75 per cent of the population and Arabs the rest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“On many nights we hear the shooting,” says Hassan Abed al-Ma'ati, 20, a student at the University of Jordan in Amman, who is home for the holidays. He refers to the violence, frequently over drug deals and often between clans, found in the all-Arab neighbourhood of Pardes Sneer at the eastern edge of Lod.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The police don't even bother to come, if it's an Arab shooting an Arab,” he said with disgust. “But if the victim is a Jew, the police will have the shooter arrested within three or four hours.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Jewish-dominated municipal government is a mess, with several past officials having been charged with corruption. Lod's eighth mayor in 15 years, an 80-year-old retired official brought in two years ago to chair an appointed city council, is the first city leader in more than a decade to make any improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of his program has been to build more Jewish neighbourhoods, even in Arab areas, a plan with which Jamil Ohini, 41, agrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We Arabs have been unable to get together and we're letting our children down,” said the tire serviceman, who can't read or write.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ohini, who also lives in Pardes Sneer, added that while most Arabs have decided not to vote in next week's national election, he would be voting for Shas, a Jewish Haredi, or ultra-Orthodox, party that is most popular with Jews who came to Israel from Muslim countries and endured discrimination from European Jews. “They're the only ones who can help the Arabs,” Mr. Ohini said. “Their interests are the same as ours.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hardships are not confined to Lod's Arabs. In the centre of town, just outside the renovated municipal offices, groups of idle Ethiopian and Russian immigrants hog the few public benches and tables. A fist-fight breaks out among Russian-speaking men playing backgammon and all the groups refuse to be interviewed or photographed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aryeh Dayan is something of a comic figure as he makes his way across the city square delivering a bouquet of roses and a dozen helium-filled balloons for someone's birthday. Mr. Dayan has owned a florist shop in Lod for more than 20 years, but lives outside town and has told his children to stay away from the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Look around,” he says. “There's not enough work and too much trouble.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lod has been a dumping ground for many unwanted people. Palestinian collaborators were moved here from Gaza and the West Bank; they found safety but no welcoming from either the Arab or Jewish communities. The same was the case for Bedouin displaced from homes in the Negev. Ethiopian immigrants have been the latest group to settle here. They're not particularly welcome either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's too much prejudice,” says David Pilcha, 21, recently returned from military service and hoping to follow in his mother's footsteps as a doctor. “We need to talk to each other.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pilcha says he has heard the gunshots at night, as has 20-year-old Mr. Abed al-Ma'ati in the Arab neighbourhood of Pardes Sneer. “We just assume the police are on their way to the scene. Then we go on with our lives.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The difference is that Mr. Pilcha, who moved with his parents from Uzbekistan 20 years ago, lives in perhaps the nicest neighbourhood in Lod: Neveh Nof, which means Scenic Habitation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the mostly dirt roads of Pardes Sneer have no names, the tidy streets here are named for flowers. The 200 or so neat cottages that line the streets teem with flowers. And guard dogs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What happens if your city dares to cut the fire department budget?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Easy: Children will die. Maybe even yours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the message of Toronto's firefighters, who have been waging a shameless fear campaign against the poor wretches who are trying to rein in costs at City Hall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those wretches are no match for Ed Kennedy, the president of the firefighters' association, who has been posing in front of burned-out houses to make his point that people probably died because of the firefighting jobs that went unfilled last year. More cutbacks would “definitely impact the response times,” he warned. Firefighters have been showing up at City Hall in T-shirts with the slogan “Seconds Count.” They've also been busy polishing their halos. They recently made heartwarming news when they donated children's toys to a family whose house (and Christmas presents) had caught fire on Christmas Day. The sobbing family thanked them on the air.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A powerful combination of fear-mongering and hero worship has made Canada's fire departments largely immune to budget cuts. As a consequence, the citizens are getting hosed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to better building materials and awareness, the number of fires in the United States, for example, has plunged in recent years – more than 40 per cent since the 1970s, according to the U.S. Fire Prevention Association. But the number of professional firefighters has increased 40 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We like to think of firefighters as brave men who rush into burning buildings and risk their lives to save others. And so they do – once in a while. These days, the overwhelming majority of their work is responding to medical emergencies – many of them non-life-threatening, such as picking up elderly people who have fallen down. Of course we have EMS for that. But firefighters have to justify their existence. So they race to the scene because they can often get there a few minutes faster than the paramedics can. The evidence that this faster response saves lives is scant to non-existent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when paramedics show up two minutes later, then what? Well, the firefighters can always direct traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In most jurisdictions in North America, only 2 to 5 per cent of calls to fire departments are actual fire emergencies. The rest are medical emergencies, false alarms, vehicle accidents and other miscellaneous events. Last year, Toronto's fire department logged 145,335 incidents, around 7 per cent of which were “reported” fires. The number of actual fires was considerably smaller. Despite those dangerously unfilled firefighting jobs, fire fatalities in Toronto have dropped from 19 in 2001 to only nine last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the nature of emergencies has changed profoundly, why hasn't our model for responding to them changed at all? The answer: union clout and spineless politicians (who often enjoy the benefit of union clout at election time). That is why we have become all too accustomed to the sight of million-dollar hook-and-ladders screaming down the block whenever a little old lady has a fainting spell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto's firefighters are near the top of the heap. They enjoy some of the best pay, pensions, perks and work conditions in North America. Toronto's per-capita firefighting tab is 30 per cent higher than in neighbouring Mississauga. Many firefighters pull down in excess of six figures. They get regular “recognition bonuses” so they won't leave, despite the fact that retention is not a problem. They can retire in their early 50s on full pensions. Best of all, they are required to work just six 24-hour shifts a month, which leaves lots of time for driving limos or working construction on the side. As for the crucial issue of response time, a 2010 study of 14 fire departments clocked how long it took firemen to get dressed and get on their trucks. Toronto placed last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the U.S., the firefighters' gravy train is crashing to a halt as municipalities run out of money. Some smaller cities are amalgamating services, and some are contracting out. At least one is planning to replace a few of its fire trucks with a paramedic in an SUV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not in Toronto, where smoke, mirrors and fear-mongering have triumphed once again. Yesterday the firefighters' union won their budget fight. And citizens will pay and pay and pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday, January 18, 2013</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto firefighters work a minimum of seven 24 hour shifts a month, sometimes eight. A Thursday column incorrectly said they worked six 24-hour shifts a month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec will, before summer, become the first province to “legalize” physician-assisted death. It's a welcome development, because we live in a country that is, in the main, a dismal place to die, criminally lacking in decent palliative care and mired in a legislative bog.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec, to its credit, is leading the way. In 2010, the National Assembly appointed an all-party committee to examine end-of-life issues. That group produced a 175-page report in March, 2012, entitled Dying With Dignity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It made 24 recommendations, including allowing physician-assisted death, strengthening advance directives and bolstering palliative care. It also said a more technical report was required to determine how to implement the proposals. On Monday, an expert panel of three lawyers provided that answer in a 435-page report, and the junior minister of health (who happened to be a member of the initial committee) said they would be implemented quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's unfortunate is that there has been so much discussion of the legal hurdles and so little attention paid to the fact that dying with dignity legislation is, above all, about patient rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, let's examine the legal quagmire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under Canada's Criminal Code, anyone who “aids or abets a person to commit suicide” is subject to criminal prosecution. There are no exceptions, and the federal government says it has no plans to amend the law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the B.C. Supreme Court ruled last year that the provision on aiding and abetting suicide does not apply to physicians who are honouring the wishes of a grievously ill patient. Ottawa is appealing that decision to the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Add to this murkiness the constitutional reality: The federal government is responsible for the Criminal Code, but provinces have jurisdiction over health-care delivery, including end-of-life care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Quebec plans to do is issue guidelines to its Crown prosecutors not to lay charges in cases of physician-assisted death. In other words, the law will remain on the books (at least until the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court</span> rules) but won't be enforced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As bizarre as this may seem, there is a precedent. Quebec did not prosecute physicians for performing abortions (and even paid for the procedure) for 12 years before Criminal Code provisions making abortion illegal disappeared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we are seeing, once again, is the law limping to keep up with public mores and desires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These technicalities have made headlines, but they're particularly important. The reality is that no physician has ever been prosecuted in the province for hastening a patient's death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And let's be clear about what goes on in the real world: Many people who are dying (or their loved ones) opt for “withdrawing potentially life-sustaining treatment” (crudely called pulling the plug) if they are on a respirator or for “terminal palliative sedation” (meaning they choose to stop eating and drinking and are given escalating doses of pain medication), all with the compassionate complicity of their care providers. That is entirely appropriate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debate now is whether, in some cases, physicians can go one step further and inject drugs that hasten death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the law Quebec plans to adopt, physician-assisted death would be allowed only where these four criteria are met: 1) The person making the request is competent and opting to end their life of their own free will; 2) the patient has an incurable condition at an advanced stage and is nearing death; 3) at least two physicians have been consulted, they agree on the diagnosis and are willing to administer a lethal dose of medication and; 4) there is a 15-day “period of reflection” between the request and the final act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, very few patients will be able to take this approach – only those with rare conditions like ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease) and some forms of advanced cancer. There would not be death panels, and people with dementia would not be put out on ice floes. If anything, Quebec's approach goes out of its way to shield the vulnerable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For the vast majority of people, palliative care remains the best option at end of life,” junior health minister Véronique Hivon said. She also promised a significant investment in palliative care, long overdue in a country where only 16 to 30 per cent of dying patients receive palliative or hospice care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, right-to-die legislation, even with strict limits, is an important step in the evolution of patient rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For too long we've had a paternalistic health-care system, aided and abetted by a paternalistic legal system. Mercifully, that is changing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the most important aspects of the Quebec reports is that they articulate well what patient rights are: The right to information, the right to decisional autonomy, the right to confidentiality and the right to die at a time of one's choosing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jean-Claude Ménard, the lawyer who headed the expert panel, put it succinctly: “Legally, we must do everything possible to facilitate the right of citizens to die with dignity.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new iPhone app helps you make the most modern form of public diary: It's called One Second Everyday and it prompts you to shoot one second of video, of whatever you are doing, once a day. The program then strings the days – the seconds – together into a movie. The results are hyper-jumpy, cryptic life stories, with no more than one or two words of dialogue possible in any given scene.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the idea of a young American called Cesar Kuriyama, a former advertising guy who now gives TED talks and other clever Internetty things. Kuriyama made a similar film from one year in his own life: It's an extremely watchable six-minute sequence (it's up on Youtube, called One Second Everyday – Age 30). The film garnered him a lot of media attention – CNN and the BBC both picked it up – only partly because of the unusual one-second-per-edit device. It has fascinated us also because Kuriyama's life, as presented in these flickering snippets, is so very attractive: He wasn't working when he made the film, so his existence is, from the look of things, everyone's fantasy of travel and socializing. He goes to a lot of restaurants and public events, and also has a lot of time to spend reading in parks. He appears to have no daily drudgery. It's an ideal hipster life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actually the story, such as it is, does takes one dark turn with about 60 seconds (that is to say, 60 days) mostly spent in a hospital beside the bed of someone in intensive care (it turns out it's his sister-in-law). She is clearly extremely ill, but by the end of the montage, she appears to be getting better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kuriyama has said in interviews the process helps to analyze what is good about his life, and how to live the best life possible. This semi-therapeutic, semi-conceptual approach actually comes from an earlier, 20th century tradition of artmaking. Documenting one's daily existence, no matter how banal the results, was a staple of conceptual art from the 1960s on. Its practitioners include the great On Kawara, who has been painting a picture of each day's date, in white letters on a black background, since 1966. When the Internet and webcams came along, these self-immortalizing records became easy to create, and the practice of ritual daily documenting moved from the domain of the intellectual to that of the banal and the prurient.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is probably just a coincidence that the title of Kuriyama's app includes a grammatical error – it should read “every day” (daily), not “everyday” (ordinary). Or maybe that's deliberate and clever. “For two years now,” says Kuriyama, in his promotional video for the app,” I've been recording one second every day, so I'll never forget a day ever again.” Why would one want to not forget a day? Perhaps one might want to forget the day waiting in a doctor's office, or at the Cleveland airport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the thing about the previous tradition of self-documenting, particularly in video: the sheer length of the artifacts. Static shots, emptiness, repetition were key. It was very much about all the drudgery that's missing from Kuriyama's privileged life. Watching them was an exercise in endurance and introspection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now we're seeing the video equivalent of the tweet. One second of film, it turns out, is all it takes to convey a mood; 15 seconds all it takes to document the anxiety, suffering, sleeplessness and relief of seeing a family member through a life-threatening illness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The constraint of the one-second shot is one that has been used in film art before. In the documentary film The Five Obstructions (2003), Lars von Trier presents another filmmaker – von Trier's mentor, the senior Danish art filmmaker Jorgen Leth – with a set of obstacles to making a good film. Leth must make the same film – a version of his 1967 experimental classic, The Perfect Human – five times, each with a different set of formal rules. The first “obstruction” is that a cut must be made after each half-second (that is, that no shot be longer than 12 frames). The result is a kaleidoscopic dance and music piece – like all the obstructions, it only makes the obstructed film more lively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why I think this app could make all of our lives look more exciting than they are – it's the perfect vehicle for public narcissism in the age of brevity.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The divisions within the aboriginal leadership, so strikingly displayed over the past week, have been laid by many at the door of Shawn Atleo, national chief of the <span class="companylink">Assembly of First Nations</span>. His alleged weakness, conciliatory approach to Ottawa and inability to rally the troops have been said to reflect a loss of authority over his constituency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Winston Churchill might have said, never have so many been so mistaken about so much.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is being played out is a momentous political and ideological change among first nations. Mr. Atleo has the thankless task of acting as midwife to the new world, while trying to manage those who sense their power ebbing. The challenge of sustaining this agenda has taken its toll, not the least on the national chief's health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the one hand are the inheritors of a tradition of political and judicial activism that has enjoyed considerable success over the past 40 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This group believes strongly that the Crown and the <span class="companylink">Government of Canada</span> must address aboriginal challenges and share political authority with indigenous peoples. These leaders, such as Pam Palmater, have a following within the aboriginal community and offer a vision of legal empowerment, indigenous sovereignty and “nation-to-nation” negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rights-based activist approach, dominant for many years, has certainly had its legal and political successes (e.g., constitutionalization of treaties and judicial recognition of the duty of governments to consult and accommodate aboriginal people), but these alone have not produced the desired results in the communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like so many activist movements of the last third of the 20th century, its leaders are re-fighting battles long since won, while the others are asking how to use those victories to improve lives in practical ways. With half of aboriginal Canada under 25, first nations are facing a revolution of rising expectations, embodied in the Idle No More movement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is where the opposing perspective comes in, one offering cautious, reasoned, incremental co-operation as the best path forward. This model, embodied in Mr. Atleo and his supporters, sees constitutional recognition and favourable Supreme Court decisions not as ends in themselves but as tools to be used to leverage economic and political partnerships with non-aboriginal governments and businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This perspective sees declining value in intense political and judicial activism and rising value in using newly won powers to gain a negotiated share of Canada's prosperity. In this view, Canadian wealth must be shared more equitably with aboriginal peoples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using this approach, individual first nations, Inuit and Métis communities have been working with resource companies, business and regional governments on strategies designed to engage indigenous peoples in the economy in ways of their choosing. Economic development, job creation, good governance and commitments to community education and health care have followed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is roughly correct to say that those parts of aboriginal Canada that are making impressive strides with the new practical, results-oriented approach – like B.C., Alberta and Quebec – joined Mr. Atleo at the table with Prime Minister Stephen Harper, while those who are divided (such as Saskatchewan), or have been unable to use the new tools as successfully (such as Northern Ontario and Manitoba), stayed away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Atleo and his supporters, in concert with Ottawa and the provinces, find ways to bring aboriginal Canadians into greater partnership with other Canadians, especially through the development of natural resources, everybody wins. If the effort fails, a new round of activism will almost certainly ensue, potentially derailing much of the economic growth our natural resources could provide and generating a substantial non-aboriginal backlash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No politician or leader, aboriginal or otherwise, should rest until the quality of life for native peoples reaches decent levels. The success or failure of Mr. Atleo's effort to navigate the tides of political change is therefore crucial to the country. To a degree that few Canadians appreciate, the nation's economic future might well hang in the balance.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">paris -- Senior adviser at the French Institute of International Relations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While hundreds of thousands demonstrated in Paris against the right of homosexual couples to marry and adopt children, French troops were arriving in Mali to stop a coalition of Islamist and rebel forces from taking control of its capital, Bamako, and creating in the Sahel a sanctuary for terrorists.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are trying times for French President François Hollande. Besieged economically at home, where his popularity is at its lowest since his election last year, can he regain credibility, if not support, as supreme commander of French forces?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once upon a time, “I intervene, therefore I am” might as well have been a French motto, particularly in Africa. But, while French national identity is intimately bound up with France's international standing – how it is perceived in the world – enthusiasm for intervention has receded. The benefits have become more dubious, while the costs and risks have grown increasingly evident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If France has again become a regional gendarme by default, it is largely for three reasons. American enthusiasm for intervention in Africa has greatly diminished since the operation in Somalia in 1992-1993 – and more globally following the long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. European interest in military intervention in Africa is as low as ever. And, as for the region's governments, it would be an understatement to say that they are not yet ready militarily to take their fate into their own hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While France is not alone – manifestations of support have come from its Western and African partners, as well as from the Middle East – it will bear the primary responsibility and the risks. For Islamic fundamentalists, France is now the “Great Satan.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the conflict in Mali is taking place geographically in Africa, but in many ways its causes and ramifications lie in the Middle East. When France intervened in an African country in the past, there was no risk of terrorist attacks on its territory or on its citizens elsewhere in the world. That is no longer the case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is too early to say what will happen in Mali or the Sahel – or, for that matter, in France itself. For the moment, the French are standing, overwhelmingly, behind Mr. Hollande. They would have criticized him had he remained passive while Bamako fell into the hands of terrorists. Yet this support may be fragile, and could collapse if something goes wrong on the ground – or, worse, in France.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the intervention, Mali was not a French priority. Rising unemployment at home seemed to be a more urgent task than did addressing instability in Africa. While the French public agrees that Mali cannot be allowed to become a haven for terrorists, the way Afghanistan did in the late 1990s, attitudes toward intervention have evolved in recent decades. In the early 1980s, after a particularly bloody terrorist attack on French and American forces in Lebanon, France's tolerance for military casualties seemed much higher than that of the United States. But this has changed. The French now find themselves on the front line at a time when they have much less appetite for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, budget restrictions have severely constrained French military capabilities. French and British military intervention was successful in Libya in 2011 at least in part as a result of U.S. military procurement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, from a French perspective, the U.S. role is somewhat ironic. In the years after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the Americans always had to be on the front line – battling the enemy abroad to avoid having to battle him at home, in the parlance of the time – while the European allies were perceived as the cleaning staff. But imperial fatigue after Iraq and Afghanistan has left its imprint. Americans are starting to enjoy – probably too much for their allies – “leading from behind,” as they did in Libya.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Hollande, war in Mali is both an opportunity and a risk. If Nicolas Sarkozy, whom he defeated, was widely regarded as “too” presidential, Mr. Hollande has given the impression of not being presidential “enough.” His fall from public grace – too statist and fiscally intrusive for the right, but too moderate and social democratic for the true left – was more rapid than that of any president of the Fifth Republic. Of course, with unemployment rising every month, it is difficult to remain popular for long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the supreme commander of an army at war, Mr. Hollande can now try to reinvent himself. But, successive presidents since Jacques Chirac have failed to reconcile the French with politics. France's citizens have tended to expect too much from their state, and now they may be expecting too little from politics and politicians at a time when deep divisions on fundamental economic and social issues run not only between the traditional right and left, but also within both camps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will foreign intervention reunite the French? Will war in Africa be the defining moment of Mr. Hollande's presidency? Will he be remembered as the French Harry Truman – a discreet, uncharismatic man who, when faced with urgent and dramatic circumstances, ended up doing the right things for lack of a better alternative?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a portentous moment both for Mali and for security in the Sahel and Europe. It is no less significant for Mr. Hollande and France.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, some of his allies abandoned him at the last moment. Yes, some of his rivals added in dollops of extra spending that he didn't want. Yes, he had to give ground on the fire-department budget after a fear-mongering campaign from the firefighters' union. But, all the same, Mayor Rob Ford can claim a considerable success with his 2013 budget – and he did.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a press conference in his office lobby after the budget passed just before noon Wednesday, he called it “a truly historical day,” a “remarkable accomplishment” and “a huge victory for the taxpayers in this great city.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At last, he said, the city has a budget that does not rely on leftover money from the previous year. “That's amazing,” boasted the mayor. And it is. For years, council has been plugging holes in the coming year's budget with windfall surpluses from the year before. It is like counting on money found in your pants pocket to pay the rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, it finally stopped. “I agree with the mayor. This is a historic budget,” said city manager Joe Pennachetti, who has pushed hard for more sustainable budget practices. He said that by holding the line on spending, the city will reduce its debt over the next 10 years by $800-million. If it keeps on its current path, he hopes that Toronto will even graduate from a double-A to a triple-A credit rating in a few years. That would indeed be an impressive achievement at a time when the provincial government up the road at Queen's Park has been hit with a credit downgrade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As often happens at City Hall, the good news was overshadowed by the antics on the council floor. Under pressure from the firefighters, who packed the public gallery, councillors put an extra $3.1-million in the budget for the fire service despite an assurance from the fire chief that public safety would not be at risk with the budget as it stood. Various councillors larded the budget with $9-million more in spending for favourite projects, from tree planting to community partnerships to “public information and advocacy initiatives.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mayor stole some of his own thunder by taking the weird step of voting for a failed, out-of-left-field motion to bring in a zero-per-cent property tax, instead of the 2 per cent in his proposed budget. That undermined budget chief Mike Del Grande, who was so cheesed off at the mayor that he refused to attend the mayor's celebratory press conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deputy mayor Doug Holyday was unhappy, too. In a stemwinder of a speech, he said councillors had buckled to the firefighters' union and produced an “<span class="companylink">Ikea</span> monkey budget” by jamming it with pet spending projects. “If the councillors in this chamber haven't got the backbone to stand up on their own two feet and make their own decisions, unpressured by unions and unpressured by special interest groups, then they shouldn't be here. Find another line of work.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as Mr. Ford put it, “it could have been a lot worse.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total of $12-million that councillors added to city spending was a drop in the bucket in an operating budget of $9.4-billion. Unlike last year, when councillors staged a last-minute revolt to add $15-million in spending, the money did not come from a prior-year surplus. Instead, the city will rely on money from reserves and an investment-interest account. In an ideal world, it would not dip into those sources either, but just keeping hands off the surplus is definite progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We had to compromise,” said Mr. Ford of his decision to vote for the budget despite the cave-in to the firefighters and the other 11th-hour add-ons. Given all the justified flak he has taken for stubbornly failing to compromise on other issues like transit, critics can hardly go after him now for compromising in the interest of passing what is, essentially, a very sound and important budget .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Finally, after years and years, we are on the right path,” said the mayor. On this issue at least, it is hard to argue.</p>

Hence Mr. Obama's plea to Americans to throw their voices behind him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If parents and teachers, police officers and pastors, if hunters and sportsmen, if responsible gun owners, if Americans of every background stand up and say, ‘Enough, we suffered too much pain and care too much about our children to allow this to continue,' then change will come.” This is not just a test of a president; it's a test of the American people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world has changed, as Vice-President Joe Biden said in an obvious allusion to 9/11. But Mr. Obama's proposals do not alter the balance between liberty and security, as President George W. Bush's Patriot Act did six weeks after 9/11. The measures that Congress will be asked to approve are far from radical. A ban on military-style assault weapons. A limit of 10 on the rounds that a gun can fire. Universal background checks on gun purchasers. And, among 23 executive orders (which don't need congressional approval), he will renew gun-related research by the <span class="companylink">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</span>, which had been blocked from the topic since 1996. Also, two members of his cabinet will be instructed to begin a national dialogue on mental illness. All these are desperately needed, common-sense ideas.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty wrecked the income trust market. Next up: Housing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the slowdown in the housing market worsens, Mr. Flaherty will be blamed as he was after effectively killing income trusts in a surprise announcement made on Halloween night in 2006. The Minister, and his government, will be accused of being bad economic managers if the housing sector falters. But what people will really be saying is: “How dare you, Mr. Flaherty?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People are funny about financial assets that soar in value, be they income trusts or houses. They see them as being special in some way, a phenomenon of nature that should be left untouched so as to allow folks to make some serious money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But assets that soar in value are the ones we need to worry about most. Everything in finance is cyclical, which means there are ups and downs. The more an asset rises in price, the more vulnerable it is to a nasty pullback that causes damage both to individuals and the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flaherty moved to cool the overheated housing market last summer by capping the maximum amortization period at 25 years for people with down payments of less than 20 per cent. The impact of this move so far has been negative, but not alarmingly so. House sales were off 17.4 per cent in December on a year-over-year basis, but prices were up 1.6 per cent, on average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking ahead, the continued availability of low interest rates could stabilize the market. Or, strained affordability and overbuilding in some centres will send prices lower along with sales. If housing sinks, expect the government's changes to mortgage rules in 2012 to be condemned the same way the income trust decision was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Income trusts, basically companies that paid all or most of their cash flow to investors through monthly distributions, were a very good investment vehicle gone wrong. Their structure allowed trusts to pay little or no tax, but it also obliged them to distribute cash with no regard to how the underlying business was performing. The result was less corporate tax revenue for government, and a series of investing blowups when trusts failed to pay the expected amount of cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flaherty snuffed out trusts by announcing the government would start taxing them in 2011. In response, most trusts converted into dividend-paying corporations that pay far less cash than they used to. The complaining from investors about the demise of trusts was long and loud, although it never seemed to hurt the Conservatives in an election. Every so often, I still hear the odd gripe from readers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blowback if housing falls hard will be worse because homes are widely believed to be a special kind of asset that benefits the entire population. It's an easy impression to come away with after watching the rules shift over the years for home-buying down payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Decades ago, buyers had to put down a minimum 10 per cent and amortize over 25 years at most. The minimum down payment briefly fell to zero a few years ago and now it's 5 per cent. Amortization periods expanded to as much as 40 years for a time, before being reeled back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To some extent, these changes resulted from competition in the market for mortgage default insurance, where <span class="companylink">Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp</span>., a federal agency, has battled private insurers for market share. But when CMHC makes it easier to afford a house, a signal is sent that the federal government wants you to be able to buy a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing's stature has been further inflated by its cultural and economic importance. Multiple TV channels celebrate housing, and a fair chunk of the retail industry is directly home related (think of HomeSense, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>, Home Outfitters, Home Hardware, Sears Home and the like). Also, housing-related spending accounts for close to 20 per cent of economic output. What's good for housing is thought to be good for all of us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mostly, though, housing is thought to be special because of its value as an investment over the past couple of decades. As mentioned in a recent column (online at tgam.ca/Dlfb), housing prices nationally have risen about 5.6 per cent annually since 1980.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After five years of up and down stock markets, Canadians have become very possessive about their gains in housing. If housing prices plunge, they'll be looking for someone to blame. That would be Mr. Flaherty, even if he was just doing his job.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody plays the bongos in the business-like coffeehouses of the 21st century, the Hudson Motor Car Company is long defunct and – sorry, jazz fans – Bird lives not. So many of the big-name authors of the 1950s – James Gould Cozzens, Frances Parkinson Keyes, Grace Metalious – survive only in the most obscure back alleys of <span class="companylink">eBay</span>. But Jack Kerouac continues to thrive, thrumming through popular culture like a pure jolt of adolescent energy generations after his death. And the frenetic cultural journey he began with his second novel, On the Road, shows no signs of ending.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on Kerouac's adventures in the late 1940s with his wild friend Neal Cassady, lightly fictionalized as Dean Moriarty, a.k.a. “HOLY GOOF,” On the Road grabbed the zeitgeist the moment of its publication in 1957 and has never let go. Those critics who noticed it were divided, but young readers especially embraced Dean and his writer friend (who called himself Sal Paradise) as heroes in an increasingly urgent search for meaning and personal fulfilment outside the rigid pale of middle-class life in the conformist 1950s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Somewhere along the line I knew there would be girls, visions, everything; somewhere along the line the pearl would be handed to me,” Kerouac wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The beatniks had their day, but On the Road made a deep impression on the even younger rebels who succeeded them. Its influence on popular music began with Bob Dylan, who described the novel as “like a bible for me” – one that changed his life “like it changed everyone else's.” In his memoir, Ray Manzarek of the Doors said, “If Jack Kerouac had never written On the Road, the Doors would never have existed.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same could be said of all popular culture of the day, with its emphasis on personal freedom and contempt for established authority, its interest in recreational drugs, casual sex and Eastern mysticism – all themes first united in the densely inked, 40-metre, single-page “scroll” on which Kerouac composed On the Road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it helped set off the social upheaval of the Sixties, the novel somehow managed to maintain its appeal as the revolutionaries donned suits, continuing to inspire outsider artists like Tom Waits. And as the age of excessive irony descended, On the Road acquired the authority of ancient tradition, surviving as a beacon of earnest truth-seeking in a post-modern milieu increasingly dominated by clever gamesmanship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was really a story about two Catholic buddies roaming the country in search of God,” Kerouac once said. “And we found him.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The book may have lost its power to shock, according to John Leland, author of Why Kerouac Matters, published on the occasion of the novel's 50th anniversary in 2007. “But the tale of passionate friendship and the search for revelation are timeless.” Rather than being a novel celebrating hedonistic abandonment, Leland wrote, On the Road “is a book about how to live your life.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the long light of hindsight, other critics now see On the Road as a book suffused with sadness and loss. “So a book formerly known for its youthful exuberance now becomes a book of gloomy middle-aged disillusion,” David Brooks of The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> complained on the 50th anniversary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that can't last. With an established legend obsessively elaborated on the Internet, a major film adaptation at last and dozens of editions in print – including one of the first-ever literary apps, which annotates every mile of the author's famous wanderings – On the Road is nothing if not evergreen.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The health of David Butler-Jones, Canada's first chief public health officer, has become a public teaching moment. In May last year, the 59-year-old suffered a stroke. Though a doctor himself, he initially failed to recognize the symptoms and thought he could sleep off the discomfort. More than 50,000 Canadians suffer from strokes each year, more women than men, according to the Heart and Stroke Foundation. As he points out, it's best to heed any unusual symptoms, and consult a professional rather than self-diagnose. I had profiled Butler Jones in 2009 at the height of the H1N1 scare. He spoke to me again from Ottawa, seven months after his stroke.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How are you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm coming along. The strength on both sides is equal now. And my short-term memory seems to be pretty much resolved. What is still improving is building stamina and the kind of multitasking that you need to do: You're reading something while you're listening to something else while you're watching something else. I'm still not there yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Canada's public-health officer, I imagine you didn't expect to be using your own health issues as public information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When people hear the word “stroke,” they think the worst and that it's the end. There is a lot to accommodate and a lot of frustration, but our conceptions and understandings have changed and improved about strokes. We learn more and more about the brain and its capacity to recover and relearn. I had to relearn how to walk backward and how to turn around. My short-term memory was affected, too. So I could be having a conversation and 10 minutes later, I would have no recall of what the conversation was. I also had to relearn the names of my four grandchildren.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are you back at work full-time now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. In the summer, I tried starting back to work. But it was impossible. I couldn't focus at work and focus on my rehabilitation at the same time. As my rehabilitation therapist said, “If you stay at work, you are going to jeopardize your progress.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That must be hard for you. You strike me as someone who loves to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, it's terrible. But my job right now is to get better. I really want to come back fully and do the job so long as the Prime Minister and others feel I'm the one to do it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stroke happened while you were at work, right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was on a conference call when it first started. I had this visual aura, and I thought, “Oh, am I having a retinal detachment?” But no, both eyes were affected. And then I was just exhausted and so I went home and lay on the couch for the afternoon. And I thought, “Well, maybe I'm getting a migraine.” I have a history of migraines but not with visual aura. And then that evening, I had a bit of difficulty swallowing. I went to sleep, still exhausted, and when I woke up, I discovered I was walking funny. I realized there was something wrong. So I had a colleague do a quick neuro test and sure enough, I was definitely weaker on the left side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't you find it ironic that many doctors attempt to self-diagnose and fail?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've always intellectually understood that's why you don't treat your own family. You don't treat yourself. But it's irresistible to try to understand what's going on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why do you think you failed to recognize the signs of your stroke?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My stroke was in the right side of the brain so I had some left-side weakness, but I wasn't paying attention to that side. It was only when I tried things that I recognized, “Oh, I can't step up on that side any more.” And because I am a physician and the left side of my brain was still good, my intellectual function was still good. I super-analyze everything and try to diagnose, and basically I should have let others figure it out. Part of the education [about strokes] is to encourage people to observe things – even if the person who is ill says, “I'm fine.” That's certainly my first reaction. I don't want to bother people at emergency departments. And I thought, “Maybe if I slept it off, it will go away.” Well, that's probably not the best thing to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't you wish you had gone to the emergency department earlier? It's well known that getting treatment as soon as possible for strokes helps minimize the damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not sure if going earlier would have made much difference for my case. It wasn't a massive stroke in that I wasn't paralyzed. I didn't have any facial droop. I don't want to second-guess any of that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When we spoke the last time, you mentioned that your 34-year marriage had ended in divorce. Were you alone when you suffered the stroke?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No, I am in a new relationship. We have been together for four years now. And Glenda has been tremendously supportive and helpful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I also remember that you described the stressful demands of your job and that you were in the process of losing weight. Do you feel the stress was a factor in your stroke?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My blood pressure was fairly under control. But I had high cholesterol and a bad family history [of heart attack and stroke]. What this has taught me is that “pretty good” control of blood pressure is not “good enough.” And the same about diet. Clearly, there's an association between being stressed and stroke and high blood pressure. The job was an impossible job with the travel and the time and everything else, so one of the other positive things is that we will be structured in an even better way to ensure that my job is doable. That's the lesson for all of us. I'm not the only one in a high-stress position. We have to pay attention to our bodies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tell me about the therapy and the tricks you have learned to help the brain recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I didn't know I couldn't walk backward because why would I bother doing that? The brain is kind of lazy in a way. If it can take a short cut, it will. My therapist got me in the habit of writing things down. For the first little while, I wasn't able to drive, but once I was able to, I would go to the grocery store to pick things up – I would write them down. But you don't look at the list initially so you can see if you can remember everything. And then before you leave, you check the list, just reinforcing it. And I do crosswords and Sudoku and other word games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if you found you were incapable of coming back, what would you do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. As I said, the stroke doesn't seem to have affected my judgment or intelligence or my practical skills. I'm not done yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, this health scare must have made you contemplate your mortality, which is never easy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ah, I've had to do that several times in my life. I thought I was done with that. I wasn't sure I would make it out of childhood. Between my asthma and, it turns out, some immune deficiencies, I'd thought I'd had enough. But I guess not. I had a family doctor once who was lovely, and who said to me, “If you were a car, you would have been recalled long ago.” It's one of those things. I don't like to pay attention to myself, but I have to.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That mission, even with the support of members of his riding association who quit the B.C. Liberals along with him, will be a very different experience than his inaugural campaign under the party's wing in the 2009 provincial election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that contest, Mr. Slater enjoyed a central ad campaign, a constituency war chest built up with several years' worth of fundraising, and a coveted database that merges the voters list with known supporters. In Boundary-Similkameen, a swing riding, party headquarters would have provided a phone bank to help identify supporters and get them out to vote. His campaign manager, financial agent and communications staff would have had training from the party. A riding service package would include goodies like office insurance and a ready-made, branded social media set-up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the next three months, Mr. Slater will be trying to replicate all that on his own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he's not the only one. An unusual number of incumbent MLAs will be on the ballot in the May election without a political affiliation. That reflects tumultuous times in B.C. politics, but also the sense that a new political reality is opening up after the 2009 breakthrough of Vicki Huntington, the first independent elected as a B.C. MLA in 60 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It has made it respectable to run as an independent,” said Ms. Huntington, who now regularly fields calls from people interested in running as an independent. She is blunt with them: It is tough to raise money, the paperwork to be approved as a candidate by Elections B.C. is onerous, and name recognition is crucial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, she toppled a high-profile cabinet minister, Wally Oppal, in Delta South on a shoestring budget – she couldn't even afford a campaign office. This time around, she sees even more reason for independents to be successful when voters head to the polls in May. “There is a mood out there for a change, and the independents can provide a middle road for the voter.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cariboo North MLA Bob Simpson was dumped from the B.C. NDP caucus two years ago, and has used that time to prepare for the solo campaign ahead. In those two years, he has aimed to build the case that he is not running against his old party. “You have to get over the disaffected label,” he said. “The first thing people want to know is, are you really an independent? If you have a story to tell – not ‘they screwed me,' but a story about proving politics can be done outside the party system – I think there is an appetite there.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John van Dongen was elected five times as a B.C. Liberal before he defected to the B.C. Conservatives last spring. He is now sitting as an independent and has spent months planning a solo campaign. That has given him time to build profile as a critic, especially around the government's handling of the B.C. Rail scandal. “There is no doubt it's tougher to run as an independent,” he acknowledged. “But the more people look at the political situation in British Columbia today, the more interested they are in having a credible option.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those sentiments will carry them only so far if their former parties go all-in against them. The B.C. Liberals have sought to discredit their former MLAs – smear isn't too strong a word – and Mr. Slater can expect no quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After almost four years of toeing the B.C. Liberal Party line, he has to shift quickly to a new message. “I have done a lot for my constituents. I carry their voice to Victoria,” Mr. Slater said in an interview. That wasn't always easy within the confines of the government caucus. “You go to Victoria and the grand pooh-bahs think something different – they think the MLAs are there to represent Victoria in their riding.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Huntington predicts he will enjoy that new role. “I have enjoyed being an independent more than I can say. My integrity is intact, and oh my goodness, does that make your soul feel fine.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec's language laws have long been controversial and a source of antagonism, but their implementation still has the power to annoy and shock. That's the case with the announcement that a quaint Quebec town has reluctantly agreed to comply with an order from a language inspector to stop including one page of English-language information in its monthly bulletin to ratepayers. It's an order so petty and unnecessary that it amounts not to the protection of a language but to an ominous government overreach into common courtesy and mutual respect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story takes place in Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts, pop. 10,000, a bedroom and service town in the Laurentian Mountains north of Montreal. It's a mostly French place; at 5 per cent of the population, English-speakers only number about 500. But they have been an integral part of local history, as evidenced by the presence of an Anglican church and a synagogue. The town has even erected plaques honouring anglophones' contribution.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With only one person in 20 being anglophone, it cannot reasonably be argued that the order to stop publishing a small corner of the town bulletin in English has heroically staved off the imminent obliteration of the French language in Sainte-Agathe. The order will, in fact, have no impact whatsoever on the health of the French language anywhere in Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its sole result has been to expose the penny-ante excesses of the province's language laws. From the mayor on down, francophones in Sainte-Agathe have reacted with dismay to the order. They don't like being forced by their government to insult and marginalize their neighbours. The mayor, thankfully and tellingly, has found a work-around, promising to continue to provide English-language information on the town website, and to publish the information excised from the bulletin in the local English-language newspaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin Bergeron, a spokesman for the <span class="companylink">Office québécois de la langue française</span>, counterargues that if everything is bilingual, then French isn't the official language of the province. But Sainte-Agathe was never bilingual. Its municipal government simply preserved a proportionate part of its official life in English out of respect for a cherished minority population. The people who enforce Quebec's language laws have good examples to follow in the townsfolk of Sainte-Agathe, but instead continue to choose to pursue the narrowest and most mean-spirited avenue open to them.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE QUESTION</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My daughter regularly brings home missives and reports written by the teachers or principal at her school. Invariably there are misspellings and grammatical errors; I am always disappointed the educators do not take more care. It also leads me to worry about the quality of education my child is receiving. I have brought my spelling and grammar concerns to the attention of my daughter's teachers, but I sense there is little resolve to address these issues. Am I wrong to complain? Should I lower my expectations? And are there some standards or guidelines set out by the provinces (mine is British Columbia) to which educators must conform as a minimum standard?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">– Parent in Coquitlam, B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ANSWER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not sure what's worse: Trying to make sense of your doctor's hard-to-read handwriting or witnessing glaring errors made by an educator on your child's report card. Teachers expect children to perform at their highest standard. So, as a parent, it is not unreasonable to expect the same from your child's educator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If spelling mistakes and grammatical errors are a common occurrence, the first step would be to take the report card or copy of the communication to the teacher, express a concern that a student may see this and make it clear that this is unacceptable. There are no guidelines, per se, for grammar and spelling skills of teachers, but there's no question that they should be held to high standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shirley-Ann Teal, co-ordinating superintendent of instructional support services at the Peel District School Board in Ontario, said if the conversation with the teacher is respectful, in most cases, changes will take place. And if it doesn't? Teal advises parents to follow up with the principal if nothing is done to rectify the situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, in elementary schools, principals sign report cards before they are sent home. They may also review grammar and spelling. Kurt Heinrich, a spokesman for the Vancouver School Board, said if there is a pattern of errors, and if the issue still remains unresolved after a parent speaks with the teacher and/or principal, the next step would be to contact the district office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Olson, president of the Manitoba Teachers' Society, said educators strive for perfection, and he understands where the parent is coming from. But Olson said parents need to prioritize between their children receiving a solid education, versus a dangling participle or misplaced semicolon on a child's report card. “If I make a grammatical mistake and otherwise I give your kid a great day, I'm going to call that a good day,” Olson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, mistakes occasionally do happen. Still, it is not unreasonable to hold educators – role models, in many ways – to the highest standard when it comes to properly using the English language.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Christmas, Prime Minister Stephen Harper took along a large number of Conservative caucus members to see Steven Spielberg's Lincoln, now nominated for 12 Academy Awards. Afterward, there apparently was a discussion about the film, led by Mr. Harper.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We can only surmise what was said, but hardened politicos, having watched a political film, were unlikely to spend much time on camera angles or lighting or, indeed, about historical accuracy. (The film was very accurate). Instead, chances are they talked about the political lessons embedded in Lincoln.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The film was based largely on Team of Rivals, the wonderful book by Doris Kearns Goodwin, about how Abraham Lincoln brought into his administration those who had opposed him for the Republican presidential nomination. Each considered himself superior to Lincoln in just about every way. But Lincoln moulded them, or most of them, into a coherent team that helped him handle the Civil War, relations with other countries (notably Britain) and domestic policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why would Mr. Harper want his group to see this film? It couldn't have been about how to fight a war or the perils of secession. No, more likely, the central message the Prime Minister wanted his team to appreciate was: We stick together, especially in adversity. Unity at all costs must be our abiding purpose, especially in tough times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there probably was another message: that politics is about the marriage of principles to circumstances, a marriage that invariably means compromise, such as those Lincoln had to make to secure just enough votes to pass in the House of Representatives the constitutional amendment outlawing slavery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harper's government has made compromises and changed its approach in some vital areas. An avowed fiscal conservative, Mr. Harper let spending grow fast before the recession and faster still in its aftermath. An “open for business” government blocked the takeover of <span class="companylink">Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan</span>. A critic of government involvement in business has put money into the auto sector, just created a new venture capital fund, finances the aerospace industry and has created new regional development agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be beyond whatever hubris Mr. Harper has – and he doesn't possess much – to compare himself to Lincoln. But it would be important for everyone on the Harper team to know something about the solitary nature of a life in politics. Although in the public eye and subject to pressure from every direction, the person at the top, as with Lincoln, is ultimately alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cardboard history sometimes suggests that Lincoln towered politically over his generation; in fact, however, he had to fight for the nomination and looked beatable late in his first term. The war was going poorly; the casualties were staggering; the voices calling for peace were rising. As the film shows, even after Lincoln's re-election, politicians urging a peaceful settlement to the ghastly conflict were active. Even when the war was going much better for the North, with victory in sight, Congress remained divided, largely along partisan lines, over slavery and the shape of a postwar settlement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keeping his team together is easier for Mr. Harper than for leaders of previous Progressive Conservative governments. The coalitions of Brian Mulroney and Joe Clark sprawled across parts of the political spectrum from Red Tories, very moderate types on almost all issues, to much more ideological conservatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keeping such diversity within the limits of the tolerable was a more difficult task than with Mr. Harper's more monochromatic right-wing group. What used to be called the “Diefenbaker cowboy” elements in the Progressive Conservative Party of the 1970s and 1980s – MPs who often gave Robert Stanfield and Joe Clark such grief – are now in the political saddle inside the Harper government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lincoln led a sprawling party, ranging from abolitionists to those who sought a negotiated peace with the slavery issue tabled until later. Lincoln didn't enter the Civil War intending to abolish slavery. Abolition evolved in his mind, and from the circumstances of the time. Leaders must marry their instincts of what's right with the limits of what's possible.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story about some Memorial University students' woeful ignorance of world geography caught many Canadians by surprise. It shouldn't have. The erosion of geography as a curriculum staple has been a decades-long project willfully undertaken by government. There's a terrible irony in that this assault on our understanding of the sense of physical place – where we stand in our world – has coincided with globalization, and massive population shifts.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Memorial professor Judith Adler taught her sociology students about the family in different parts of the world, she should have been able to safely assume that those students, having achieved entry to university, would know where Africa or Europe is on a map or be able to identify the Atlantic Ocean. The fact that some couldn't is an indictment of a system that's failing young people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians are responsible for the second-largest country in the world in terms of land mass. If we're to fulfill our duty to the trust we've inherited, the sovereignty over that vast area, then it's critical we understand our geography. More than that, Canada absorbs hundreds of thousands of newcomers each year. If native Canadians don't know where Canada stands in the world, how can we expect people who've come from distant countries to?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does it do to a sense of national identity when you don't know where you are on the map and, in terms of human geography, who you are as a people? As a teacher, I've seen the difference geography can make in my students. Those who embrace it – who “get it” – develop a “sense of place.” They understand that who they are is determined in part by where they are. Undeniably, geography contributes to a sense of identity on a personal level and collectively as a nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geography is a building block of civil society. The vibrancy of a democracy is directly linked to a geographic education. Geography is critical to understanding Canada's challenges, such as sending troops to Mali, building pipelines in B.C., addressing treaty rights of first nations or opening the Northwest Passage to tourism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overarching solution is strengthening geographic education from kindergarten through Grade 12. Sustained emphasis on geography in the curriculum is a prerequisite to solving geographic illiteracy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curriculum alone is only part of the solution. Geography needs teachers – teachers whose passion is fostered and enhanced by geography-specific professional development, teachers who will fight to ensure that geography is given its due, along with other core subjects such as geography's boon companion, history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the most dedicated teacher needs the tools to teach. To this end, the Royal Canadian Geographical Society and Canadian Geographic Education make teaching tools freely available for both the classroom and the home school, placing within easy reach resources on Canadian topics such as the boreal forest, energy use, watershed protection, the War of 1812, national parks, railways, football, capital cities and wind energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even these efforts are not enough. Educational authorities need to commit, parents need to get on board, and students themselves need to declaim that geography matters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we continue to shortchange Canadian children in terms of a solid education in geography, we're essentially robbing them of their potential and capacity to engage fully in society as part of an informed citizenry. Not only is this grossly unfair to today's students, but it also unduly compromises Canada's future in a globalized world.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For two weeks this spring, John Gibbons will be missing the left side of his infield, his putative ace, his opening-day left fielder and his No. 1 catcher. Is this any way for the <span class="companylink">Toronto Blue Jays</span> to start making a run at their first playoff spot since 1993?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“From a selfish standpoint, it's not ideal,” the Blue Jays' manager said Thursday, when the rosters for the World Baseball Classic were unveiled. “I'm new to these guys, they're new to me. But this tournament is turning into a big thing and you're playing for your country. There's pride involved there, so about all you can say is, go for it, man.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But,” Gibbons added, “it is frustrating.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's as if they're holding a special spring training for all our fears. Brett Lawrie (Canada), Jose Reyes, Edwin Encarnacion, Esmil Rogers and Melky Cabrera (Dominican Republic), and J.P. Arencibia and R.A. Dickey (U.S.) are all scheduled to take part in the event, which could potentially take them away from the Blue Jays' spring-training site in Dunedin, Fla., for a little more than two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reyes's health figures to be an issue this season based on the fact the <span class="companylink">Rogers Centre</span> has artificial turf, so the soft grass of spring should be a respite. But the site of his first-round WBC games, San Juan's Hiram Bithorn Stadium, has FieldTurf. When Reyes and the <span class="companylink">New York Mets</span> played a series in San Juan against the Marlins in 2010, he was kept out of games after suffering what the team called a “turf-related” back injury in the first game of the series.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We'll leave aside the thought of Lawrie rounding third and bearing down on Arencibia when Canada plays the United States at Chase Field in Phoenix. Good luck getting Lawrie to tone it down during a game. This is in addition to the fiddling around with the biological clock that comes from competitive games being played at a time when pitchers and players are usually working up to the regular season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leave aside the mixed messages that come from post-WBC analyses of players' performances. Think instead about Lawrie, the Blue Jays' third baseman, and Reyes, their new shortstop, acquired in a 12-player deal with the <span class="companylink">Miami Marlins</span> and unveiled Thursday at a news conference at the <span class="companylink">Rogers Centre</span>, being apart when they ought to be developing an awareness of each other's strengths and limitations. Given the ground they cover and their full-throttle approach to the game, that's not good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Dickey, a knuckleballer, and Josh Johnson and Mark Buehrle making up three-fifths of a new rotation, Gibbons's preference would be to have them get used to each other not just in Grapefruit League games but in the usual side-work that is a spring-training staple.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arencibia has told teammates that he is not ceding his spot behind the plate on the day that Dickey pitches to either Josh Thole or Henry Blanco, who have caught Dickey, so there might be value to the two of them being together under the tutelage of U.S. manager Joe Torre. What can't be measured is the impact that being in the same clubhouse with Derek Jeter and Ryan Braun will have on Arencibia, who has been thrust into a leadership role on the Blue Jays without a great deal of mentoring. Right there is your silver lining, folks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could have been worse. Jose Bautista lobbied general manager Alex Anthopoulos – gently, it appears – to be on the Dominican Republic's team despite the fact he underwent surgery in August to repair a torn wrist tendon sheath. Bautista asked Anthopoulos a week ago if there was “a crack in the door” that might let him play. He was assured that was not the case. “If I have to be the bad guy,” Anthopoulos said after the Reyes news conference, “then I will.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was no malice in Anthopoulos's voice, just as there was none when Gibbons voiced his frustration. The Blue Jays are, rightly, four-square behind the concept of the WBC. They've just never been where they are this spring for a long, long time. There's not been this much at stake.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Fraser Institute</span>'s Provincial Healthcare Index 2013 gives an unexpectedly favourable assessment of health care in provinces that are known for big-government policies, considering that it is a think-tank with strong limited-government views. In particular, the large central Canadian provinces emerge well; for instance, Ontarians have the shortest wait times.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be a mistake, however, to conclude that the <span class="companylink">Fraser Institute</span> is endorsing Quebec's or Ontario's health-care policies. The author of the report, Bacchus Barua, makes it clear that he is not assessing policies. Yet the conclusions invite some such inferences. The “bottom line” of the study is about value for money; in other words, it is a comparison of the overall provision of health care with the cost. Quebec, according to Mr. Barua, has “the largest number of medical resources per capita,” yet spends the least on health care per capita. One recently departed premier (Jean Charest) and one outgoing Premier (Dalton McGuinty) can fairly claim some credit, having both had quite long terms in office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, evidence on patient safety and mortality in Quebec was not available, leaving a degree of uncertainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta appears to have the greatest clinical effectiveness, but also the highest cost – a result that is not surprising, considering the overconfident spending in that province in the past several years. The present government is somewhat belatedly promising restraint for the next budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The poor assessment for Prince Edward Island probably is partly an expression of the lack of opportunities for economies of scale, in contrast to Ontario and Quebec. That constitutes a strong argument in favour of a high degree of sharing of services – health care and other spending areas – among the Maritimes provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newfoundland and Labrador also received a low ranking, which must partly reflect the province's spread-out population – not a factor that Mr. Barua takes into account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All provincial governments, however, should examine their policies in the light, or shadow, of this substantial study.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Jungle is a column that uses social media to explore the wild and woolly world of relationships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘Never go back” is probably the best second-hand advice that I never took. My friend's mom – one of those moms who feeds everyone, whom everyone loves – used to say “going back” to a previous relationship was never the right, smart, or good decision. I've done it anyway, over and over, but I think of her maxim often.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm undecided about whether “going back” is always a bad idea – it's semi-true that if it was “really right” the first time, it wouldn't have ended, although timing and the circumstances of different eras vacillate so wildly. But I know for sure that it's a habit, especially among people in their 20s or 30s who were unlikely to marry their first love, or even their second or third. When I asked about “going back” on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, everyone who replied said they had, even though they shouldn't have. In every case, it didn't go well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Don't” is the takeaway, at least according to my <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> “@” replies. @savvymercury tweets, “i have! it worked out well for several months, then the old problems returned. a break up is not couples counseling, it seems.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I've gone back,” @cassandrajowett tweets. “Second round was exactly the same. Exactly. Only I felt way more stupid for falling for it all a second time.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">@Afis8 was self-reflective about going back. She tweeted, “I have, a couple of times, and each instance resulted in failure for different reasons.” She writes “Ultimately rekindling things'll never work unless sufficient time's passed.” And, presumably, growth. Of her own re-relationship, she tweets that it “probably wasn't strong enough in the first place to have lasted” and adds in an e-mail, “We were never right for each other, and now we were too defined in our own identities to be able to ignore that like we had when we were a bit younger.” Realizing that is growth of another kind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes going back isn't the problem; the first breakup is. “Jeremy,” who saw my tweet about going back, e-mailed about his “snap breakup”, where “suddenly you're crying, getting your underwear on and rushing out the door.” This, of course, led to another try, and another split.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why do it? For known, ready comfort; to right wrongs; to capitalize on an existing connection; to see what would happen if the players were the same but the factors were different. The human need for do-overs and reimagining the past is powerful, but may-be it's something we shouldn't be putting each other through.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I would like to confess to lighting the recent fire that lead to the many deaths at the Tazreen Fashions Ltd. factory in Bangladesh.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am neither Bangladeshi nor a factory worker, and I have never set foot in the building that was set ablaze in late November. Nonetheless, I have ashen thoughts and blood on my hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As clothing designer for the Canadian arm of a multinational clothing retailer, my work consists of taking fashion styles in the marketplace and adapting them for our customers' pocketbooks. I design inexpensive clothes destined to be manufactured by the most competitive manufacturers, in what we call “offshore” factories. The company that pays my salary was a client of Tazreen until the fire, as were many Canadian retailers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I know what the smoke smelled like as it hit the nostrils of the factory workers. I even know what the smoke looks like from synthetic fibres catching on fire. I was in a factory in India when an electrical fire started. The clouds of smoke pushed their way up from the basement into the design studio on the third floor. As we rushed down the stairs, we had to pass the grey mist of synthetic fibres that had caught fire and were reborn in a thick and acrid cloud pushing its way out of the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I remember waiting for the fire trucks to come and watching as the sewers rubbed their hair with blackened hands to get out the white ash. Prematurely grey Indian faces in colourful saris with kabuki-like makeup stood silent with the circle of survivors. The shock and the sudden disconnection from work had lent a dreamlike veil over the scene. In a Canadian setting, this surrealistic silence would have been broken by a fire engine or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not on this side of the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On this side of the world, a senior factory worker figured out the source of the electrical fire and, with the help of his colleagues, put out the blaze in relative silence, as one would have during a yoga class. Two official cars did arrive after the fire was contained. Inside were police officers, but these officers were not there to help put out the fire – they had come for the customary bribe so this incident would not be officially recorded. The loudest part of the day was the sound of the officers' steps, heavy with their loot, as they left the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Bangladesh, stories circulate that the Tazreen fire was arson. My point is, this fire was lit by me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am the one who asked our factories to make a $9 blouse, and, by default, Bangladesh is one of two countries in which clothing can be imported duty free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My employers are happy that we will have this item on the floor en masse for next season's sales. Our customers have forced us to hack down the prices to be competitive in this market of cheap clothing and off-price bargaining that we call the Canadian clothing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Popular thinking is that clothing at this level, since it is mass produced, is automated. The truth is that most of the procedures used to make these garments that fuelled the Tazreen fire passed through the now deceased workers' hands. Perhaps one of the perished women was sewing the back neck of a garment to its collar. This operation in Bangladesh costs a fraction of a cent compared with what it would cost in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wonder whether she was holding on to the collar that I had asked her to sew to meet my cost target when she died. I know that our shipments are sometimes rushed at the last minute to make the vessel. Maybe that's why the managers asked some of the workers to stay seated when the fire started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have third-party inspections and in-house compliance staff, and our company is world class. This means that factories are inspected on a routine basis. I wonder: Where were the inspectors that day? Perhaps they were at one of the other hundred factories that are officially working for us. For sure, they were not at the thousand factories that we have not asked to be used as subcontractors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The point is clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I confess to the murder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason is clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The collar that the Bangladeshi woman was holding as the smoke pushed through her lungs was destined for a killer-priced shirt next season.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE QUESTION</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My father was not around while I was growing up, and rarely helped financially, while our mother raised me and my sister by herself, with a debilitating disease that left her unable to work or do many household chores. She has since passed away and my father is making an effort to be involved in our lives and be there for special events for my boys (he lives out of town). The thing is, he often says things about how to raise kids, or “you know how kids are …” type of comments, often on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. I just want to scream at him that he has no idea how kids are – he's never raised any! How do I handle this situation? Do I tell him politely to stop, or just continue to ignore it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ANSWER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would be truly annoying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was a stay-at-home dad for many years. (Five? Seven? Honestly, it's all a blur, and I still work from home – well, from an office in my garage, and the difference is subtle but important: My kids will knock on my door for the big problems, but not the small ones.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing used to bug me more than people who had no direct experience – sometimes citing the fact they had “nieces and nephews” – pontificating on the topic of parenthood, saying what they'd do in this or that situation, the implication of course always being they'd do it better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It always made me want to slip a full diaper into the person's briefcase when they weren't looking, or stuff a peanut-butter sandwich into his or her VCR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I could see how it would be particularly galling coming from your own never-there-when-you-were-growing-up father. And I do think you should say something. But not just “stop.” I think this is a golden opportunity to clear the air between you two, if you approach it right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bear in mind first of all there's a whole culture underpinning his attitude and POV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like, consider the difference in meaning between the verbs “to mother” and “to father.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“To mother” means “to nurture, to raise, to protect, to take care of, to change diapers, to do the 1,000,001 things it takes to get a helpless little creature onto its feet and out into the world and even then to continue to fret and worry in a way only the grave will put a full stop to.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“To father” means “to provide sperm resulting in a pregnancy that comes to term.” As in: “Did you hear? Dave's fathered a child – now he's got to get out of town!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I hope the connotations of the term “to father” are starting to change, now, as we get into the meat of the 21st century. I will say that on a Wednesday afternoon in the park across from my house there are usually at least as many dads as moms pushing their kids on the swings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think also on the fact that your father is now trying “to father” you in a much more active sense of the word. It may all be a little trying, but at least he's trying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, you should know, I'm a soft-serve sucker for dad-stuff in general (in even its cheesiest and most obviously manipulative permutations. Like that commercial where the dad lifts a bike his kid wasn't expecting out of the back of his pickup) and in particular for “he came late to understanding his role as a father, but he's trying now” scenarios. Like in The Wrestler, in which Mickey Rourke as a washed-up actor – oops, I mean wrestler – tries to resuscitate his career and repair his relationship with his daughter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These movies, and that trope in general, have resonance because it's true that some men mature late. Sometimes long after they have kids. Sometimes not until their kids have grown up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Sometimes not until their kids' kids have grown up. Sometimes, to be sure, not at all.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But better late than never, right? So express your anger, for sure. He won't, or at least shouldn't, be surprised – having left a woman with a debilitating disease to look after you – if you have a few tart things to say to him. A very caddish, un-menschy thing to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let him have it, right between the eyes. Get it off your chest. He's made mistakes, that's clear. But then again who hasn't? Clearly he's trying to make amends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He just needs a little guidance, it sounds like to me. He's trying to grow up. He's trying to be a man, trying to figure out how “to father” you in a more meaningful sense, at long last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he doesn't have a lot of experience. Help him. Teach him how to figure out how that's done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What am I supposed to do now?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big news for Hockey Night in Canada's lockout-shortened 2013 season is a double dose of Don Cherry every Saturday. The voluble former NHL coach is getting a second helping between periods of the second game of doubleheaders as well as his usual Coach's Corner perch in Game 1.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone neutral on The Don in this country? No one? Judge yourself accordingly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting maximum mileage from the controversial Cherry is part of CBC's plan to carry HNIC to its next NHL rights negotiations later this year or early next. With less money than its private-side competitors (TSN, Sportsnet), CBC's splashy presentation Thursday emphasized its 60-year legacy and good citizenship medals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We'll see whether Cherry is Polite Don, who lauded Gary Bettman's lockout performance, or Cherry Blaster, who kicked off HNIC's 2011-12 season by calling former NHL enforcers “pukes.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owning the long-term future of hockey broadcasting lies not with a weekly blast of Cherry (who turns 79 on Feb. 5), but in getting the new generation of fan who doesn't wait till a Saturday intermission for its scoops. The coming challenge for HNIC is winning the race to control the news cycle on social media in the week before showtime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the lockout showed, authority now comes from tweeting a story instantly. TSN has owned this fast-breaking segment with Bob McKenzie (475,500 <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> followers), Darren Dreger (375,000) and Pierre LeBrun (219,300). Sportsnet has responded with Nick Kypreos (130,200).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HNIC is promoting Andi Petrillo to its <span class="companylink">iDesk</span> to monitor such things during games. But when Cherry leaves, HNIC will likely need to sell its story-breaking chops via Elliotte Friedman (84,778 followers).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It can't just be about Saturday any more,” Friedman told Usual Suspects Thursday. “You have to be a presence on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> and digital. Sports fans want to know everything in real time, they want to be entertained. That's a 24/7 job now. Don can do his thing once a week, but he's unique. For other stuff, it helps how visible I am in social media. That's the future.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't diminish HNIC's brand, Friedman says. “The show still has power, it still has great influence in the business. Having said that, we can't be beat on stuff, we have to write it when we've got it. Last season I was able to keep a few things for Saturday, but another story blew up in my face.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friedman is working on exclusive material for Saturday's opener. “I'm like the guys at the other networks,” he adds. “I never like to get beaten on anything. No one has to tell me to go looking for stories. I'm wired for it.” Good, because CBC is counting on Friedman to feed the beast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's The Score?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rogers has asked the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to allow it more live sports content and fewer news segments per hour on The Score, its new acquisition. Rogers suggests it wants to use the channel for a winter-games format and other sports content from its stable of properties. Rogers also plans to use the network as a highlight news source. Rogers' problem with The Score is that this is not just another regional or specialty service. The Score has 6.6 million subscribers nationally and brings in approximately $45-million a year. It has a premium spot on a lot of carrier's channel lists. This is not a place to dump content that doesn't fit on its other five channels, or to endlessly replay canned highlight programming from the night previous. Having jettisoned The Score's audience, Rogers will have to build a new one to keep these numbers. The Score could also be a source for NHL or <span class="companylink">Toronto Blue Jays</span> postgame content.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's fascinating listening to Christopher Nolan talk about his first feature, 1999's Following, recently released on Blu-ray and DVD by the valuable folks at Criterion. It's fascinating not only because one realizes just how quickly Nolan went from being a self-taught weekend moviemaker equipped with a 16mm camera and some willing friends to one of the world's most successful filmmakers (Inception, The Dark Knight Rises), but also because he still practises much of the stuff he learned while working on the cheap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He believes, for instance, that one should always shoot with a single camera if possible (it makes for more careful blocking), and that you should never alter a physical space – even if it's a set – to accommodate the camera. The space must be as real and organic as possible for the actors, because that's how make-believe acquires the ring of truth.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And working in black and white – which budgetary restrictions compelled him to do when making Following – cannot be beat when it comes to certain kinds of stories. (Just ask Woody Allen, Steven Spielberg, Michael Haneke, Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese – all of whom have gone monochromatic at least once.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take film noir, for instance, the genre that has provided Nolan's most fertile inspiration throughout his career. If Following works, which it does rather smashingly well, it does so because the story – of an underemployed writer who randomly follows strangers for literary inspiration, but who winds up being the victim of his own obsessions – is so ideally suited to the meagre circumstances of production: beaucoup shadows, cramped spaces, tight compositions and unnerving close-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No wonder Nolan has been Batman's most effective big-screen interpreter: He gets the darkness and knows how to use it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm betting Nolan has more than a passing acquaintance with Raw Deal, a mini-budget, poverty-row noir gem from 1948 being screened by the Toronto Film Noir Syndicate at 8 p.m. Friday at the Dominion (500 Queen St. E.).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Directed with brute efficiency by the brilliant Anthony Mann (later one of the greatest directors of 1950s westerns), Raw Deal stars the burly Dennis O'Keefe as a freshly escaped con who took the rap for an awesomely creepy Raymond Burr and who expects compensation for the hard time done. Not a chance, of course, but that's the noir way: There's never any real escape, and fate always closes in as dark and heavy as the shadows cast by cop car headlights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shot by the masterful John Alton, Raw Deal is pure minimalist perfection: Every angle, composition and cut is calculated in the service of a grim story, and the sparseness of the production is perfectly harmonized with the bleakness of O'Keefe's situation. That's why I think Nolan must have seen it more than once: As a lesson in milking maximum impact from meagre means, Raw Deal is a master class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Greg Hanec decided to make one of the first feature films shot in Manitoba, he also turned to black and white, and the result was Downtime, a true testament to what can be done with $16,000, some helpful friends and a concept that begs for the barest minimalism. Contemporaneous to Jim Jarmusch's Stranger than Paradise and predating Kevin Smith's Clerks – both of which Hanec's 1985 movie intermittently resembles – Downtime is a deadpan, four-character account of twentysomething aimlessness that unfolds largely in long single shots in which the mere cleaning of a floor or emptying of a closet takes on the impact of high drama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Echoing also the existential drifters of contemporary Atom Egoyan, Hanec's characters are terminally numb and chronically disconnected, and his Winnipeg is every bit as somnambulant and quietly sinister as Guy Maddin's. Forgotten for years after a brief release and successful showing at the Berlin Film Festival, Hanec's home-crafted exercise in prairie malaise is now available on DVD and is showing next Thursday at 9 p.m. at Videofag (187 Augusta Ave.). In glorious black and white, naturally.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline of the small independent bookshop has been one of the sad stories of my lifetime. It was well under way before Amazon and e-books turned us all into compulsive scrollers, squared-eyed with LCD-screen-related insomnia. The death knell began clanging decades ago, back when I was a sullen, chain-smoking teenager, hanging around the Book City outlet on Bloor Street West in Toronto's Annex neighbourhood, chatting up the friendly guy who worked there and (it was rumoured) wrote brilliant minimalist novellas about twisted gay sex when he wasn't standing behind the till recommending I read The Secret History by Donna Tartt.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back then, we lovers of small independent bookstores believed superstore chains were the apocalypse. How naive we were! Sure the big boxes did their damage, but soon Amazon had decimated them in turn (Borders closed, Chapters consolidated and Indigo eventually relegated to the jasmine-scented candle and throw-blanket business, with the odd copy of Gardening Life thrown in for show).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across Canada now, as well as in the United States and Britain, the old-fashioned main street with its butcher, baker and candlestick maker is mostly a thing of the past. Soon, the cynics say, there will be nothing but <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> and cheap nail salons, and that's only because you can't get a double-double or a pedicure on the Internet (yet). In the near future, the story goes, our main streets will be nothing but online shopping pick-up points and badly lit sizing depots – miserable places filled with grey consumer zombies itching to get back to home to their iPads so they can buy some more crap they don't need. A world without shops to poke in. No more places for patient gay intellectuals to recommend novels to sullen teenage girls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except – to my delight – there's another story brewing. It's a side narrative to the larger (admittedly grim and unstoppable) trend of the whole world basically going to hell, but it's a happy tale indeed. And that is the return of the small independent bookseller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story starts just over 100 kilometres north of Toronto in the village of Creemore, Ont., also known as the quaint little place my mother now lives. It's tiny but she loves it, and for good reason too. Creemore, unlike many little towns of its size, has a famous microbrewery, a local/organic food shop, two great cafés, an old-fashioned newspaper and a very good bookstore called Curiosity House Books &amp; Art Gallery. It also has a disproportionately large population of relatively affluent, educated professionals who have retired there, and because of this, when the owners of Curiosity House announced last year they were closing shop because their building was being sold, the town rose up and tried to stop it. A group of book-loving locals wrote articles in the local newspaper, held feverish meetings and made calls to rich friends asking for money. When the money materialized but the collective investment model proved too complicated, Ralph Hicks, a local sculptor and businessman, swooped in and bought the place on a whim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was an impulse buy, he told me in an e-mail interview from Mustique, where he's on holiday, “rather like a Mars bar … I didn't even look at the financials beforehand, but just guessed that if the previous owners had been able to run it at break-even for 17 years, I ought to be able to do the same.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interestingly, the novelist Ann Patchett recently did precisely the same thing with a couple of friends in her hometown of Nashville, Tenn. Like Curiosity House (which bills itself as “the best little bookstore in Canada”), Patchett's Parnassus Books is more than just a place to buy the new Zadie Smith or Alice Munro. As she outlines in her essay The Bookstore Strikes Back in December's issue of the Atlantic magazine, her bookshop, and others like it, represent much of what we have lost as a consumer culture: “the community centre, the human interaction, the recommendation of a smart reader rather than a computer algorithm telling us what other shoppers had purchased.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just to be clear, the reimagined independent bookshop is not really a money-making outfit. While these shops might break even, in some cases turn a small profit, it is only because their customers override their instinct to act like consumers and act like good citizens instead, paying full price when they could get a discount by crossing the street or just clicking a mouse. At Curiosity House, Hicks got locals to sign a contract saying they wouldn't shop on Amazon – for the most part, it's worked. Patchett went on The Colbert Report and asked viewers from across the country to buy her book at full price from her shop's website – and they did, in the thousands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even here in the U.K., there are stories of citizens taking over their local libraries and bookstores, and operating them on a collective, volunteer basis. And in Ottawa, just recently, another local independent store, Books on Beechwood, was saved by an angel investor like Hicks. But for every rescue story there is also a loss: Collected Works, another Ottawa independent, failed to find funding and closed this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline of the independent bookstore is an old story, but that doesn't mean there isn't hope. Maybe the solution is to stop viewing such places simply as businesses that must succeed or fail according to the market, like doughnut shops or nail salons. A really good bookstore is not a doughnut shop; it is a social good. As citizens – and even potential investors – we need to put our money where our moany old mouths are. Or as Ralph Hicks puts it, “any community-driven effort to save a bookstore should focus on finding an idiot like me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lucky for one little bookstore, it did.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Painting snow is something Canadian artists ought to know about, and they do, although that snow comes in a number of varieties. There are the marzipan smudges of James Wilson Morrice (wet snow beneath heavy grey skies); the ploughed and roiling hummocks of A.Y. Jackson, which catch sunlight from the blistering blue above; the japoniste blanks of David Milne (who used the pristine sheaf of paper as a signifier of snow, sculpting into the whiteness with his delicate painter's touch); Cornelius Krieghoff's sugary frostings (just add milk); and the stiff formal planes of Lawren Harris (snow or Styrofoam – you be the judge). All these artists were obsessed with the white stuff, devoting their artistic powers of persuasion to the assertion that winter – no matter how unspeakably frigid and uncomfortable – is still a thing of beauty.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jack Chambers, too, made it his mission to capture the look of snow. In his Sunday Morning series of the 1970s, he evoked the eye-scalding brightness of a winter's day as glimpsed through the window of his London, Ont., home. In these paintings, the frigid external world is set against an arid, centrally heated interior – that unique Canadian environmental condition that causes our skin to flake off, our lips to crack, and our hair to stand on end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Chambers was also a master of the more temperate side of winter, where the Arctic air relents and the snow begins to rot, becoming granular, and catching the light in glittering flecks, particularly at the end of day. In Gibbons Park, for example, Chambers records a moment of suburban winter beauty. A molten winter sunset is hanging in the barren treetops, its colours glazing a river's surface and infusing the sky with hues of radiant tangerine, yellow, and saffron gold. Along the river's edge, the snow glows blue, rotting into the riverbank made spongy with the melt. But is this spring or just one of the tantalizing false promises that winter makes and breaks on the long journey to warmer times? True, the bare tree branches suggest that the harshest days of winter are largely passed, that the river has finally lost its ice for good (it still seems barely liquid), that the planet is once again swinging toward the sun. But we have been fooled before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, in mid-January, we too have turned the corner – our winter solstice is nearly a month behind us and the days are lengthening – but the full warmth of spring is still months away. Helpfully, Chambers directs us to the principle source of current loveliness: the sky, most particularly the sky at twilight, that brief passage into night when ravishing colours gather overhead, offering visual consolation for the cold. Like Chambers, we must look up and work with what we have.</p>
