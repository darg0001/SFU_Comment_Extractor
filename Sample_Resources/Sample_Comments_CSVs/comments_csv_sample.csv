Fluff pieces on Wicca?The Catholic Church is a scourge. Christ, if he existed, would find the silk, and brocade, and gold, and ceremony, and sense of entitlement, abhorrent. He would blast the Vatican to Hell. Which is where it belongs, if you believe there is such a place. There is not enough time left in eternity to wipe out the sins that have been committed in the name of this religion.The Catholic Church oppresses women and gays. It turns a pompous blind eye to the torture and sexual abuse of children by its priests.There are many questions this Pope needs to answer:why are women not allowed to be priests?why are priests not allowed to marry?why does the Church not endorse gay marriage?why is the Church not openly weeping and atoning every day for the injuries caused to the victims of pedophilia at the hands of its own priests?what is this ridiculous notion of original sin, and why does the Church think that humans are guilty from the moment of birth?why does the Church maintain its preposterous stand on birth control?Catholics need to keep in mind that Christ only became officially divine at the Council of Nicea, in 325 AD. Humans made Him divine. Humans.The Catholic Church is an entirely human, frail, weak, mendacious institution. When the Pope answers the above questions, the rest of us might listen. Until then, he is only preaching to the blindly, and stupidly, faithful."

9,9732100,colin7,source2_9732100_8,If there's one thing that persuades me that there is no God - it's the pedophile priests. No matter what these perverts do to little children - God does nothing. NOTHING! Priests are supposed to believe there's a God up in the sky watching everything we do. And if we behave badly we'll go to Hell for eternity. So why do priests rape children and risk going to Hell? The Biblical God supposedly loved children above all else.Yet he doesn't even lift a finger to smite even one priest who raped a child. Why is that? Please don't tell me that God will punish them after they die. Because after we die we just stay dead - as far as we know. So why does he allow such outrageous acts to continue against innocent children? Because he doesn't exist is the probable answer. And the pope and the priests know it only too well.

There is no truce or peace to keep in the Central African Republic, there is only a dirty brutal war to be fought.Canadian foreign aid?Stolen aid makes donors rethink their blank cheques to South SudanSubscribers OnlyJUBA, SOUTH SUDAN -- The Globe and MailPublished Thursday, Feb. 06 2014, 7:06 AM ESTLast updated Thursday, Feb. 06 2014, 7:06 AM ESTThe shocking and slightly ridiculous image has already gone viral: dozens of South Sudan soldiers marching through the bush, each wearing a cheery child-sized bright-blue UNICEF school bag on his back.The United Nations children's agency had intended to donate the backpacks to schoolchildren. Instead they were looted and given to South Sudan's soldiers. Some of the backpacks have even ended up in the hands of rebel fighters."
27,16908301,pmulrich63,source2_16908301_2,"It is unfortunate that the G&amp;M editorial board continues to perpetuate outdated liberal interventionist myths about the &quot;good&quot; that a peacekeeping mission could do on the ground. It also over inflates Canada's possible contribution in a conflict with religious and ethnic complexities like CAR. To refer to possible Canadian contributions mentioned in the editorial:&quot;Canada could play a role in trying to resolve the sectarian conflict through negotiation&quot; - How? This is France's former colony and France military forces are likely collaborating with the US military on regional counter terrorism efforts. It is unlikely that France would welcome Canadians leaning in on their counter-insurgency efforts in CAR in support of the government, with French military forces apparently struggling to prevent violence with less than a brigade of troops on the ground.Contributions to UN appeal - again, this suggestion over estimates the impact on the ground that dumping Canadian taxpayer money into UN trust funds can have. Fact is, the UN have very little operational capability of their own to deliver direct aid to populations in complex security environments. UN agencies act more as another donor layer (which a very high overhead of salaries and field expenses) while they have to rely on partner NGOs that struggle in sectarian and religious conflicts of recent years to establish security and access for operations in the context of increased politicization of aid like in Afghanistan. The Canadian government giving money directly to capable aid organizations like the International Red Cross and Medecins sans frontieres is a better guarantee that aid will reach populations, but even these agencies have limited capacity to cover but only a small proportion of total needs. Aid is important, but can never be more than a band-aid in the absence of a political settlement between parties.As to the option to send Canadian Forces logistical assets to help the French military or the African Union troops like last year's operation in Mali, that is again nice but of limited effectiveness. As capable and professional as Canadian Forces are, they may be better used in more covert support roles with US and French efforts to weaken extremists and other support networks to opposition forces in the region. that wouldn't be publicized and therefore could not contribute to the public Canadian feel-good efforts.The G&amp;M should move its international analysis beyond the bemoaning of Canada's supposed golden age of peacekeeping and UN missions, to favor a broader public dialogue of what Canada's international niche could be in international peace and security operations in new conflict trends such as Syria, Libya, Mali, CAR and others beyond a superficial &quot;do something&quot; for a Canadian feel good effect with little impact on the ground."

Past experience seems to indicate that humanitarian aid merely absolves the locals from responsibility to look after their own, extra money is spent for for more ammo .... Peace keeping does not resolve fundamental causes of war, negotiation just kicks the can down the road.

It assumes that you can counter the power of a symbol with numbers and graphs and jargon. .. &quot;One might be forgiven ( or not ) for blaming the media for an absolute, complete and total lack of any technical data or context vs. alternate energy options. Most journalists and blogs merely serve to display a total lack of understanding of even the most basic energy physics and engineering in favour of greenie wishful but uninformed energy dreams.I for one believe in global warming caused by CO2 as fundamental contributor. The climate models however are flaky due to complexity. But one may apply the cautionary principle. That having been said none of the solar and wind sources will ever replace our base load energy demand ( Ontario and German propaganda to the contrary ), nor product chemistries derived from fossil base stock. The nuclear option seems politicised beyond any rational consideration - never mind that is in technical fact one of the cleanest electricity and heat sources available.The article is entirely valid.

As much as the labour of coal miners is celebrated in them, there is a recognition that it is hard work for those involved and the environmental costs are not covered. I don't quite think the comparison works; the labour is still hard (for those at the bottom anyhow) but the audience and writers of the various tales of the plot, the story of the tar sands, are not quite as ignorant.If the best Mr. Babiak can do is to celebrate the re-wording of the tar sands story, I would suggest we're all in trouble. All people are hypocrites but that doesn't change the fact there comes a point when some types of pollution are too much, the costs are too high, children really are paying the costs for their fathers' economic practises--their parents don't get black lung but the children do suffer cancers found out about in their adulthood. Trying re-writing that story; but I don't think supporters of the tar sands like to hear it, but try.If the supporters of the tar sands want to get someone to offer a challenge to the semantic sale of the tar sands, don't rely on a first-time novelist trying to sell an article to the Globe and Mail. To be honest, they have enough editorial challenges going on. It would be more credible if the story was told by a recognized wordsmith. I can't help but think of Clint Eastwood talking to an empty chair to prove his point--I didn't get it then, I don't get Mr. Babiak now. There are certain truths about the tar sands and coal pollution that have to be faced; none of us like them, but they have to be faced.

Snooze. Look, that is a big scientific accomplishment, but it is not the kind of human drama likely to keep your layperson audience awake.Sure, you could have your gritty everyman blue collar worker drama set against the backdrop of the oil sands. But so what? You are not really telling the story of the oil sands there, your story could just as well be set among the nickel mines of Manitoba or the copper mines of Ontario or, for that matter, the oil patch off of Texas.The columnist does not make a compelling argument for his claim that the oil sands are an amazing dramatic story fit for the big screen or winning novel."

The proportion of engineers per capita in Alberta is much higher tham any other province mostly due to the level of engineering knowledge required to design these processes and plants.But Skylow, you are also wrong. While GCOS (Great Canadian Oil Sands - now Suncor) was funded by an American company (Sunoco) assisted by tax breaks from the Feds and province,, Syncrude would not have happened without direct investment and tax breaks from the federal government.Some of you &quot;pure laine&quot; Albertan fed bashers need to get yourselves educated in how the oilsands development happened in the early years.

Why would so many choose to listen to the appeals of those who echo the avarice and instinctive hatred of past demagogues and dictators? If your creed makes you feel okay, for example, with attacking and murdering a young MP, like Jo Cox, because she is advocating charity and brotherly love, or murdering fellow citizens for same-sex love, you should seriously question your creed and those you are consulting with, whether they are politicians or religious leaders or other. You are on the wrong path, and there is something wrong with your thinking.It is also sad to see so many placing trust in Trump, despite his blatant dishonesty and lack of education and expertise, on the other hand.

That's why innocent people can be found guilty ---George in fact did not kill Harry even though he is found guilty of doing so---and, on the basis of the evidence available at the time to the jury, it may even be beyond a reasonable doubt to the jury that he is guilty. That is also why why what it is reasonable for scientists to believe at one time to be true on the basis of the evidence may not be reasonable for them to believe to be true on the basis of new evidence or theoretical developments. Running these distinctions together itself helps contribute to the post-factual, post-evidential world.As Professor Kingwell suggests,, enthusiasm, fanaticism, and the lust for power have long undermined any concern for truth or what the evidence warrants one in believing to be true. We could cite Hitler or Stalin or the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. However, a less stock and less emotionally loaded example is the famous, fraudulent ' Donation of Constantine' , forged by medieval monks to be used by the medieval Church to support its claims to spiritual and temporal authority. The forgery itself was established only in the 15th century by Renaissance humanists using philological evidence,, but the fact that the forgery came to be fairly well recognized as proven, even in the Church itself apart from a few holdouts, buttresses Professor Kingwell's view that the disregard for truth and evidence in the contemporary world may be something different.. So what is the difference?Here Professor Kingwell isn't very helpful, but it is surprising that he doesn't bother to mention the role of post-modernism and post-modernist theory in the humanities and social sciences over the past 30 years---apart that is to say, from analytic philosophy departments and analytical philosophers of truth and knowledge and science who generally kept the distinction in mind between truth or fact on the one hand, and knowledge or evidence on the other, the running together of which underwrote the arguments of the post-modernists. Trump and his mode of operation aren't new, as Professor Kingwell recognizes. , What is new is the inability of most of the academy to distinguish in any systematic and coherent way, or want to do so, at least outside analytic philosophy departments, between what it is politically useful or appropriate to believe and what it is reasonable to believe on the evidence to be true,, and this inability has been conveyed to generations of students. . Appeals nowadays by most of the academic left to science or evidence based judgement are as a result, really quite hilarious, and, unsurprisingly, really quite futile except in so far as they reinforce what is already believed."

He has also admitted that the earth has gone through natural heating periods.But that is not all; Phil Jones has admitted that his record keeping is very suspect and that he has 'lost track' of much of the data that was used to create the now infamous 'hockey stick graph.'

I much prefer the non-fiction truth tellers, the ones who tell the truth about history that we didn't learn in school (Howard Zinn, 'The People's History of the American Empire', for example).History is written by the winners with the blood of the losers. And so naturally the winners don't want the world to know the real facts."
291,30507031,JtheM,source2_30507031_17,"When media organs like the G&amp;M constantly spout nonsense like trickle down economics, the 'broad' benefits of globalization for 35 years, when it has been repeatedly, and resoundingly disproven, what would one expect. It really can be traced back to the corporate take over of the media and the infancy of 'think tanks'. The siren call of the corporations is propaganda, the more ridiculous the better. That way the opposition spends all its time fighting right wing fantasies while the 'moderate' agenda is implemented, it isn't moderate. Now we are near the time that the populace is so frustrated, and can no longer discern friend from foe that no amount of propaganda will placate the masses. The Plutocrats will, of course, try and direct this angry frustration of the body politic to its sole benefit. If they succeed we are through the looking glass, and they will have unassailable control over an enslaved/impoverished population. If they don't succeed their rotten, greedy, oily hides will decorate our public gathering places. There really are no other options"

I remember her well.I used to titillate her imagination.She used to tickle my epistemological ontology."
