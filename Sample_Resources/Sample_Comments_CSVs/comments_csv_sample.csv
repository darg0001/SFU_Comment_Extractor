More of our kids should probably do the same.The nanny and coffee server situation doesn't make us look too good. Come to Canada, raise our children and pour our coffee for us, but don't expect anything in return - like the same chance that the immigrants I'm descended from had - to work their butts off so their descendants (me and mine) could have an easier life. We are, to put it bluntly, exploiting them.With the HD Mining situation, the narrative has changed again from adventure seeker to exploited underclass to skilled workers who will work for less than Canadian skilled workers, and have no ties to Canada. They will send their wages home. HD Mining will sent the coal home, and in the long run Canada will be left with nothing but a hole in the ground while the mining companies and the miners go on to exploit some other country with resources to sell.The exploiter becomes the exploited and we have only ourselves to blame.The TFW program needs to be stopped.

Myself, I am rarely away for more than a day or two, with the exception of the 6 weeks I took off for bypass surgery.So overall sick leave use is a combination of both extended and brief bouts. And, given the average age of public servants, a large share will be dealing with extended bouts stemming from serious or chronic health problems. Twenty-five year olds may call in sick because of a hangover or cold. Fifty-five year olds are more likely to be using up sick leave in large quantities on hip/knee replacements, chemotherapy, bronchitis that just won't go away, or, as in my case, bypass surgery.When people make comparisons of sick leave use between public and private sectors, they have to factor in age demographics.

It is easy to pick on the employee. The employee has no real power.For my part, I have worked in government and for large multinationals, to junior capital pool companies and in recent years have become an entrepreneur starting my own consulting firm which I have recently sold. In other words, I am capitalist! Needless to say I have seen the myriad of work place cultures and I can broadly speaking classify them into two broad categories. These are: Large organizations and small organization.Multinational and government for the most part have somewhat similar workplace environments in that they are typically hierarchical and heavily stratified with immense bureaucratic infrastructure. The bureaucracy is there by design to ensure that a disciplined decision making is adhered. Which also means these are not the most stimulating work environments around (be it government or large private companies). There are exceptions of course.There are no incentive available to government such stock options or stock purchase plans that offer employees an opportunity to get invested in the organization. And bonuses are generally quite paltry compared to large companies such as the financial , tech, resources etc.. So you need to have decent incentives. That does not mean that abuse should not go unpunished. And benefits such as sick leave, vacations etc. should be reasonable. However, so called toxic environments created through, neglect, mismanagement and downright incompetence on the part of management and not the employees. Speaking as a former employer of ten people, its is the responsibility of management to set the tone and to create the culture that they wish to have. In this case management are the deputy ministers of each federal department, and heads of all public sector unions. They are the ones who create the environment and that is where changes need to begin. Changes at this level ripple through the organization and that is how new work place cultures are achieve. New culture is not achieved through snipping the bottom of the org chart. Until, ministers and deputy ministers don't change their &quot;entitlements&quot; and behavior around spending money nothing is going to change down the line at the lower levels. The lower levels take the liberties because management take the liberties. The public service provides vital work to us the &quot;Tax Payer&quot; (I prefer citizen) and they should be respected for that. They do it without a possibility of getting rich which means they do it for service to the country.

The public service competes with the private sector for employees and this naturally causes a balancing of the compensation packages between them.

Public servants are treated as if they should be kissing their desks everyday in thanks for the opportunity to work there, rather than being treated as valuable assets like employees of strong private sector companies are.

Ms. Wente is way off line in telling that there is no problem in the reason federal workers are having mental illness. The main reason is the terrible policy of the government which has resulted in terrible managers who lack people's skills and who are mostly boomer women whose kids have moved out or are DINKS. I had one and all she did was to go on 6 months out of twelve of training leaving the team leaders who themselves were boomers who would never retire in charge. and where I worked the turnover was 50% because the younger workers (younger boomers and/or Gen X) were burned out by the terrible management of these DINKS old ladies. There are too many managers as compared to workers, look at how compensation for workers is rising from an average of $49,000 to an expected $130,000. Mostly because the government is laying off younger more junior workers instead of laying off middle managers. For example that same manager I had, was having 35+ years of pension service so she could get a great pension (70% of her final 3-year average salary,too good if you ask me as compared to the younger ones starting today), but she still isn't retiring. Forcing more of the older boomer workforce, especially middle managers to higher up Director Generals, ADMs and DMs whose wage bill has also gone up retire would do wonders to the overall wage bill of the federal government. Really for all the political correctness around, the most productive workers are in their 30s and 40s who have experience but aren't how do we say this politely over the hill when it comes to new technology like social media etc. and new methods of management. Paul Martin was right in the 1994 budget etc, buy out the old geezers!Finally, as this COMMENTARY IS WRITTEN BY A KNOWN PLAGIARIST who would have been fired by a more respectable newspaper like the New York Times, we must wonder if in fact who really should be fired.

Unlike the private sector, there is no finite financial constraint -- virtually unlimited debt can be imposed on the pubic.3. Unlike the private sector, management rarely has a direct incentive to hold the line.4. The counterparties have a different nature. In private sector collective bargaining there are two private interests in competition. In public sector bargaining there is a private interest opposed to the public interest, which is a fundamentally pathological arrangement.Public sector wages and benefits should be pegged, by legislation, to a formula that sets it at the AVERAGE provided for similar work in the private sector.

Organization on their part to present their views on such matters is both natural and logical, but meticulous attention should be paid to the special relationships and obligations of public servants to the public itself and to the Government.All Government employees should realize that the process of collective bargaining, as usually understood, cannot be transplanted into the public service. It has its distinct and insurmountable limitations when applied to public personnel management. The very nature and purposes of Government make it impossible for administrative officials to represent fully or to bind the employer in mutual discussions with Government employee organizations.

I'll grant you that is not true of *all* PS jobs, but it is true of many. As such, the incentives to remain in place, as opposed to jumping ship for careers elsewhere, are not just perks, they are levers for getting the job done.That said, public servants often operate within a &quot;hurry up and wait&quot; environment. Word comes from above that something is absolutely, terribly urgent, so you work on it, but then have to wait months on end for the many layers of approval and &quot;accountability&quot; to work their magic before being able to take next steps. Within that environment, there can be many occasions where one is prompted to ask oneself &quot;Does it REALLY matter if I'm there today? Maybe it's better if I stay home today and show up in better form tomorrow.&quot;.Finally, I don't think the sick day stats likely factor in all those times when people took sick days, but kept checking their work e-mail or voice-mail from home, just in case there was something that required their immediate attention.Incidentally, the new Workplace 2.0 standard, from Public Works, will have everyone working in smaller spaces, closer to each other, with minimal walls.

How much does the private sector lose every year in productivity -- theirs, and the colleagues they infect -- from people who go to work with the flu or something like it?Where private sector employees have a similar level of entitlements (or even a moderate level), what is the usage rate? What do you get when you compare apples to apples, rather than comparing career public servants with part-time wait staff?I will admit freely: there have been weeks where I've been sick, toughed it out, gone to work and only taken the sick day or two towards the end of the week, once I felt I had delivered on necessary files.

The biggest barrier to managing the Public Service like a business is structural: you can't switch your product lines in response to the market, because a Cabinet decision to start a program or initiative can only be overridden by another Cabinet decision to stop it.And &quot;banked leave&quot; is not an actual liability -- it's a contingent liability, one that only comes to pass if every Public Servant falls ill simultaneously, to the maximum of their accumulated sick days.

Money comes mostly from the provinces, feds and municipal taxes. With each program everyone has rules of how that money is spent etc. During the Harris years we joked that our work stations should literally be on wheels because our job and job location changed monthly. This cost the tax payer a huge amount of money in loss productivity alone. Was that the workers fault, no. Massive amounts of re-training dollars to learn new computer systems that actually didn't work very well, again the workers were told to do this.

These cuts, however, were mostly scheduled to begin in the latter years of the five-year period, which meant that the majority of them were unlikely to occur before the next election was held.The personal income tax cut raises the basic personal exemption to $10,000 from its former level of just over $8,000 over the five-year period. This was projected to result in an average tax savings of $16 for each Canadian in 2006, with the final total reaching $192 at the end of the five-year period.

Several years ago a recent immigrant stated to myself and others that his mother living in another country needed surgery so she was going to come here as an immigrant and when she had her surgery would go home again. I wonder how much of that went on? Another problem with our health care is there doesn't seem to be any oversite mechanism of the system. The hospital in my city is woefully inadequate for the population it serves. Yet I'm constantly reading in our newspaper of another high priced direcor of this or that department, while nurses can't get hired on a full time basis.

Because a company can end up subsidizing its competitor this way and lose profits as a result.The reason why Germany and the Scandinavian countries are so good at getting their employers to hire and train inexperienced workers is that they either pay subsidies to employers to justify this cost for employers, or they lower worker mobility, where companies don't need to be afraid of losing their trained workers to their competitors.Canada needs to solve this problem that makes Canadian employers afraid to hire and train inexperienced workers.
