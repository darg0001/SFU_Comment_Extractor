The arguments against Gilmour's right to teach a class in the way he wants based on the agreement he had with UofT are not logical. His engagement of the students and teaching abilities are not only known to his students. They're known to everyone who asks his former students for their view. It's called communication. It's the primary way in which a teacher should be judged (by their students). Something severely lacking in university hiring practices IMO (especially in the sciences).Why is Gilmour's ideology more repugnant than, say, my high school curriculum (about 18 years ago). Which had almost no female authors. If there is no interest in his class, then the real problem is with UofT for hiring him."

Canada played such a role in the 80s on South Africa, when Mulroney defied the UK to champion the Commonwealth as a major player in the battle against apartheid. The problem is that coming from Harper and Baird, a Canadian boycott will have no impact, because they are widely seen around the world as incompetent and marginalized failures at diplomacy. As a result, no-one is going to follow their lead. Indeed, foreign countries are simply going to chalk this up to domestic Canadian political opportunism from the party that introduced the idea of the permanent electoral campaign and so will disregard it.Harper and Baird are simply too unsophisticated to manage foreign policy."

If the Latimer principles can be applied to countries like Zimbabwe, Pakistan to suspend them from Commonwealth, it is unimaginably why Sri Lanka with 216 pages of UN war crimes report, is exception to Globe & Mail. Tamils were resilient to vote for the Tamil party under the shadow of guns and military intimidation because the voiceless minority wanted their voice heard loud and clear among good hearts in the global community. The difference is Zimbabwe, Pakistan are countries. Tamil is an oppressed community for six decades by majoritarian regime, solely on communal politics"

PM Harper has even told that's right told the U.S. he will not take no as the answer for the Keystone XL pipeline. That comment in itself shows the degree of desperation that has set in for PM Harper and his pipeline committment to his Alberta backers. The world has changed and Alberta has to change with it. If Alberta is set on taking the tar sands out of the ground then they will have to refine it in Alberta. This means that the majority of the environment fall-out will rest in Alberta and not in Houston, Texas, China or New Brunswick. Financially, Alberta needs cash. The latest flood damage in Alberta at the end of the day will probably cost more than a billion dollars out of the provincial coffers. There are many more significant expenditures that need revenue, health care, education and on and on. Royalties from natural gas and other carbons have already dropped significantly. The bottom line is bring in a sales tax like the rest of Canada, increase the Alberta provincial income tax rates that are already probably the lowest in Canada and at the same time increase the Alberta Provincial Minimum wage which for some unknown reason is near the lowest in Canada. The times are a changing and with this revenue sources have to also change. Alberta has a future but with a different blend of sources for provincial revenues."

The light oil has now been mostly extracted, and the natural gas industry is in decline. Sure the oilsands are a huge resource, but every day there is less in the ground. Alberta must transition to a renewable revenue base. Those who disagree with this likely intend to leave the province when the resource party is over, and should have their opinion taken with that in mind. A sales tax is better than increased income taxes. I don't want to be taxed either, but I also would want groceries to be free. Some things just can't be wished away."

From 11th century land ran out and overpopulated Europe could not feed itself onward. Trade became necessary, but Caliphate (effectively tariff piracy) was milking worldwide trade. To loosen Muslim grip Crusade adventurism only worsened the matter for Europe. There were 100 famines in 75 straddling 1300 AD.And when in 15th century the short-sighted Ottomans blocked the trade routes altogether, desperate Europe had to spurn agrarian Christianity (Catholic) turning to Protestantism and Democracy, rule of the moneyed Demos, thus to Corporate Capitalism and organized violence to survive.

If you weren't shouting out that global surface warming was accelerating out of control in 2007 over the prior 15 years when observed warming was running 50% higher than models, then you have no business declaring that global surface warming has 'paused' in 2013 over the prior 15 years when observed warming is running 50% lower than models. Both views are equally wrong, based on cherry picking noisy short-term data. Please explain how two 15-year time frames that have 10 years in common can be so different? And how that common 10 years can be stretched into a 15-year 'pause'.What you really have is a temperature 'mountain' 15 years ago and a temperature 'trench' during last 5 years with a normal rising surface warming trend in between. As far as I can see, there is no real warming bias in climate models. However, there is a severe bias among skeptics who carefully select a start point for their comparison at one of the largest El Ninos on record. What can be concluded from my comment?

We are bombarded with New Studies at, or even before their initial publication. Highly respected scientific journals can be reviewed by a few members acting as anonymous referees for the editor. This peer review is to establish acceptability, but not necessarily validity of the study. This review does not necessarily endorse the conclusions. IPCC was a prime example of this new breed of political science. Some stated peer reviewed facts were presented to the public:Himalayan meltdown by 2035 resulting in 60 million people suffering from food security. 50% in loss of African agriculture. 55% of Netherlands below sea level. 40% of the Amazon rainforests wiped out. Increase in natural disasters Man made CO2 is a greater threat to mankind than water vapor in the atmosphere. The conclusions are clear:The U.N. climate panel (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)) should only make predictions when it has solid evidence and should avoid policy advocacy. Straying into advocacy can only hurt science credibility. The IPCC s work, contains many statements that were assigned high confidence but for which there is little evidence. IPCC s response to errors when they were subsequently revealed was slow and inadequate. The review also called for an overhaul of the panels management, including the creation of an executive committee that would include people from outside the IPCC. Some are calling for the dismantling of IPCC."

I've seen the AR4 Figure 9.1 several times before.The general idea is that any kind of warming should show up as an increasing trend in the Hot Spot or TMT region over a long period of time, or a noticeable Hot Spot when plotted in the IPCC manner. If we don't observe that phenomenon, then either the climate is not really warming or our understanding of climate thermo-physics (as expressed in models) is not correct. Both of these conclusions play into the skeptics' weak hand.We have observed a Hot Spot appearing after sudden warming jumps, like during El Ninos, but I think we have not yet observed an ongoing one caused by general climate warming. It doesn't mean it's not there, it's just not been observed yet (because it is something that's very difficult to measure against the noise over the present 33-year life of satellite records, IPCC uses 100+ years of model data in Figure 9.1). On the other hand, perhaps it should be understood as an intermittent phenomenon - just a capacity that get used occasionally, which is what I think Walrus Jr. is getting at. I don't know enough about this phenomenon to confirm that. But this is a digression from what's important.I agreed neither conclusion refutes AGW at all. The first one just refutes climate warming of any type (if the period is long enough, even longer with intermittency) and the second one refutes climate models ability to replicate warming properly (in a very narrow area of the atmosphere).Warming of the climate system (from whatever cause) is indisputable so the 'no warming' conclusion makes no sense but I'm sure Spencer is quite happy to let his readers form this incorrect conclusion.I believe the main purpose of the plot is an attempt to refute models ability to replicate warming properly. The problem here is that we lack precise observational data (per my earlier reply), which means the comparison presented in the plot is not meaningful. The model trends may or may not be accurate. We don't know. If the TMT Hot Spot is an intermittent phenomenon, then it only makes sense that the different observations would vary so much, and the plot comparison is a completely useless exercise over only 33 years.That's my understanding of the Spencer (or Christy) plot issue.

At the same time, dependence on the private passenger vehicle needs to be reduced by changing our approach to urban planning so that far less commuting is necessary. As fossil fuels continue to be depleted, reduced consumption will be forced whether we like it or not."
