Whatever your point is, I found it hard to discern in your own haphazardly written post. Are you suggesting that those who don't know Mr. Gilmour are better suited to assess his words, and consequently his ideology, because they can do so from an objective moral high-ground? Well, I call BS. Interpreting anything at face value is a slippery slope. Pretty sure they call that 'judging a book by its cover.' The author can, and should be given credit for providing at least some back story to Mr. Gilmour's character. It does mitigate 'the more repugnant aspects of his acknowledged ideology', which is wonderful because they are fallacies. The irony of your statement is that those 'repugnant aspects' have been subjectively and emotionally conjured up by the public. There is nothing to take away from Mr. Gilmour's comments besides the obvious: he can't connect with female or Chinese writers, Canadian literature, and therefore refuses to teach it in his elective course. But no, we must immediately assume the man a sexist, a racist, an oppressive, ignorant boor, who has no right to be educating our nation's young minds. One pompous, relatively unknown Canadian author says a few marginally ignorant words about a few genres and writers and all of a sudden it's a national outrage. Give me a break.",100,100
