I am talking about physical and mental health causes. But most people might say that health issues especially are not being adequately addressed by key players in society. And the reasons are quite clear. Since people with mental health issues have a stigma associated with them, and people in the elite and in a position to make a difference don't care that much about the issues, nothing really gets done there. It's as simple as that. And you can have one big physical health issue and your ability to work and income that goes with it is suddenly cut.

Frustrated by the lack of success of the sovereignty project, an aging leadership and support base has understandably become frustrated and somewhat desperate in recent years.  Ms. Marois, a leader clearly of inferior calibre when compared with earlier PQ leaders, gives vent to this frustration in ways that are both unable (and unwilling to even try) to conceive of a creative balance between the nationalist and liberal-democratic values hitherto guiding the sovereignty project.   While no fan of the sovereignty project, I find it sad that the PQ is imploding into a narrow populist nationalist dead end.Interestingly both the Scottish National Party and the main Catalan Nationalist Party in Spain had in the past looked to the PQ as a model for an independence movement within a larger advanced modern democratic state.

So little insight.Notwithstanding the blather spread in the western press, like this editorial, the folks running Iran are intelligent, sane, reasonable people. Since the end of the US election, they have sent one hint after another that they want to normalise relations with other countries.  The Iranian election put a government into office that is way less interested in supporting the war in Syria.  The Iranian economy needs an end to funding the Syrian war, and an end to the US embargo. They had already signalled an interest in cutting a deal on nuclear issues.Very quietly, without bluster, without prejudice, we need to meet with Iran, and sort out a few long-standing issues in a very frank, honest, and humble manner. Now is the time to make a deal. It is easy to see what the deal would look like. It would solve so many problems.For sixty years UK policy in Iran has been seen through the lens of BP. Likewise, for sixty years US policy has been seen through two distorting lenses: the views of oil companies, and the views of Israel.This distortion of reality has been a disaster. It has led to at least five wars, it has led to decades of suffering, and it has led to well over a million deaths. The amount of US debt traceable to this mistake in the range of $ 3+ trillion.China and India have the benefit of not being blinded by those misleading lenses. They have assessed the truth a lot more accurately, and have made commercial arrangements accordingly. We need to change the narrative. Many Iranians hold the view that it is the US and UK cannot be trusted. They have solid historical reasons for that view.The military police state of Reza Pahlavi replaced the democratically elected Mossadegh government. The chief agents of the overthrow of Mossadegh were the Eisenhower administration (i.e., John Foster Dulles) at the request of the UK gov't acting on behalf of BP (i.e., William Fraser, then chairman) because BP did not want to pay the same royalty on Iranian oil that had been agreed for Saudi, Kuwaiti, and Neutral Zone oil. When BP refused, Iran nationalised its holdings.To punish Iran for this deed, the UK set up a maritime insurance boycott to stop Iran from exporting oil. It strangled Iran's economy. The hypocrisy is understood by considering the UK nationalisations of railways, coal, and steel production in the same era.In the end, they overthrew the democratically elected government of Iran at the behest of an oil company over a commercial contract dispute, and replaced it with a 26 year long police-state tyranny. Small wonder Iranians bear ill feeling.The Truman administration had previously refused to do the bidding of the UK government, regarding it as wrong. Dulles had no such scruples.",False,1380168091879,False,,14,[],,3,14532245,none,2,1380168978225,0,17,False,Site,OldBanister

Western nations and America's Arabian Gulf (or Persian Gulf) allies subsidized, and provided sophisticated western arms to support, Saddam Hussein's attempt to conquer Iran and to overthrow the young, then still popular, Iranian government. Result: 1/2m Iranian dead, and a generation of amputees to remember.The desperate struggle to defeat Saddam Hussein was, for Iran, equivalent to the Somme, Ypres, Paeschendale and the suffering on the Western Front in WWI.  Proportionate to population, that is roughly the same as if 2m Americans or 200,000 Canadians had died in a war. (Canada's war dead from WWI + WWII was about 115,000)Again, the western nations, largely for the benefit of their oil companies, inflicted a second horrendous wrong on the people of Iran.  It put us in bed not only with such benefactors-of-mankind as Saddam Hussein, but also with a number of other Gulf 'allies' certainly no more savory than the regime in Iran - such beacons of democracy and civil rights as Saudi Arabia and its friends.How can we vilify the government of Iran as the ultimate evil, when we ally ourselves with regimes that are no better, and sometimes worse? With regimes that have used chemical weapons to kill their own citizens? With regimes that operate secret police forces certainly no less vicious and no less outside the rule of law than SAVAK, and now the Basij? With regimes that have stifled all free speech and democratic reform? With regimes in which women are treated as chattels?Plenty of hypocrisy to spread around, for sure.If somebody came to Canada and expropriated all the oil and gas fields in Alberta, would we not think that wrong?  If somebody subsidised a war to install Saddam Hussein as a conquering dictator over Canada, and it cost 500,000 lives to stop them, would that be ok?  Of course Iran now wants nuclear weapons: America will not attack a nuclear-armed state.  What Iran wants and needs is a guarantee that the US and other nations will stop meddling in its politics and undermining its sovereignty.  Canadians might be expected to understand that issue.These talks are a good opportunity to undo past wrongs.Iran has a highly educated, western-looking population.  The government of Iran is run by sane, highly intelligent men who have a very clear understanding of history.

That is not how Iranians see themselves.Iran, and many Iranians, particularly urban Iranians, see themselves as a highly educated, highly skilled, highly developed, cultured, modern, progressive society - sort of a mixture of France, Italy and Austria.Whether that is our view of Iran doesn't change the fact that, culturally, the self-image of Iranians is surprisingly similar to the self-image of somewhere in the middle of Europe.Siding with a butcher like Assad is so completely the opposite of how Iranians see themselves, their culture, and their society.  Iran has a much bigger future in western-oriented policy.  There is a huge thirst for democracy and modernity in Iran.Iran has no future as a Russian ally - Russia has been an enemy and rival of Persia for centuries. Iran also has no future as an ally of any of the autocracies in the Arabian peninsula. Persia and Saudi Arabia are also long-running rivals and enemies. There are transcendent cultural and historical reasons for that, too.Over the long term, Iran and Turkey (themselves big commercial and regional rivals) are the nations in that region that have big futures. They are nations that largely share our values (Iran perhaps even more so than Turkey). They are nations and cultures with which we should be able to get along, on a wide range of commercial, political, and security issues. The places that matter to Iran as future partners are the EU (urban Iranian voters would vote to join the EU tomorrow if they had the chance), India, the US, China, and, yes, Turkey.For historic reasons based on oil, we placed ourselves on the wrong side of the Saudi - Persian rivalry. This was an historic mistake.So many of Iran's subsequent experiences arise from reaction to those events, and prevention of their recurrence.We find ourselves on war footing against Iran, a country that is our natural ally; and in bed with Saudi Arabia, a country with which we share almost no common interest in terms of social norms, democracy, law, culture, or civil rights. All because of oil.Historic mistakes have led to 60 years of trouble. We are pursuing policies that are not in our interest, and not in the interest of Iran. The policies we are pursuing are presently exacerbating a sectarian struggle that is spreading across the Middle East.Both Iran and the West need to change the music. An historical error needs to be un-done, and the relationship needs to be re-set as a co-operative one based on common interests.There is a deal to be made here.

The Iranians simply are not suicidal. The fear of Iranian nuclear capability is a fear that the West and Israel will lose the strategic advantage they possess in the region. That may be a relevant concern to the West, but that is also a very specific and debatable reason for subjecting Iran to sanctions and, possibly, war.

This was further illustrated devastatingly in the exchange with the NDP's Jack Layton over attendance in the House of Commons.  Layton's accusation was easily rebutted (or, at least, could be deflected) by a confident and skilled leader (i.e. I was preparing the Party for election and office, hearing Canadians across Canada, Liberals have an able team to hold Government to account in the House at all times and I was there when needed etc.) but Ignatieff choose to take personal offence and attack Layton in a counterproductive manner.On the Tory adds - sure they were unfair but Ignatieff had months and months to make his mark and convince Canadians that Tory attack adds midterm were simple evidence that the Tories were defensive, negative and had little constructive to offer.It is telling that Ignatieff attacks both Rae and Dion, his two main rivals for leadership, implicitly on grounds that they each complicated his own ascendance to the leadership.  The better view is that Ignatieff was initially recruited when the Liberals under Martin were likely to win the next election.  The plan was for Ignatieff to then hold a senior Cabinet portfolio and have time to become a seasoned and effective spokesman for the Party but the Liberals lost and Ignatieff was forced to seek leadership before he was personally or as a public figure in Canada ready.  He then blocked Rae's (who was ready) accent.Ignatieff's assessment of Dion's role in the attempt to form a coalition with the NDP (with Bloc support) shows a misunderstanding of parliamentary roles.  The Conservatives were not convincing the other Parties that they were prepared to act effectively to address the domestic effects of the global economic meltdown, It is the role of the primary opposition Party at all times to stand ready to replace the governing Party if that Party has lost the confidence of the House - this Dion and the bulk of the Liberal leadership, Ignatieff being the notable exception, were prepared to do.

It would also be nice to see atheists looking to find common ground with people of faith, because I don't think the path to peace will ever be paved with contempt.I'm not affiliated with any religion, but I have respect for people of faith, and would never assume they are all simple-minded literalists who believe every word of their holy books. I have Christian friends and family members who understand the Christian story to be a symbolic attempt by our ancestors to describe and understand the universe. It is a mythology that resonates with them, inspiring faith rather than literal belief. Many don't even believe in God, at least, not in the sense that most atheists would define God, i.e. the old man in the sky. It is the Christian teaching these people adhere to, not the so-called 'fairy tale'. From this point of view, it's the atheists who seem somewhat naïve in their interpretation of how religious faith works.For example, you don't have to believe in God, or in the divinity of Jesus, to think it's a good idea to 'do unto others as you would have them do unto you.'As for blaming religion for all the violence in the world, think again. While it's true that many wars have been waged in the name of religion, it is not religion per se but ideology and an 'us vs them' mentality that lead to most of the violence in the world.

The article of the author starts out by arguing that the negative reaction to Mr. Gilmour's interview has been illogical and emotional (her words). She goes on to acknowledge his known (even to her) biases and then argues that students probably shouldn't be forcibly subjected to his ideology (her word). But, given all that, she argues that he's really quite a nice guy and an engaging and entertaining teacher who challenges his students, things she knows on a personal level. However, those of us who are not his students can only assess Mr. Gilmour's views on the basis of his statements in the interview, statements the article's author somewhat equivocally acknowledges to have been problematic, although she, like Mr. Gilmour, believes without clear explanation to have been misinterpreted. Her argument is essentially an emotional one in that it relies on first person experience in dealing with Mr. Gilmour, which apparently for her mitigates the more repugnant aspects of his acknowledged ideology.

Check that, I’d say an F is more in order. What is your point? That the author’s argument is emotional, and therefore invalid? That because she knows Mr. Gilmour intimately (or, at least, more so than the hordes of politically correct crybabies spurring this ridiculous, media-driven public outrage) she is not qualified to speak to his character and the true meaning behind his recent comments? Or is your point that the spoken word should always be analyzed objectively, repudiating context and the chance that there is something more to consider about what was said, and who said it? Whatever your point is, I found it hard to discern in your own haphazardly written post. Are you suggesting that those who don’t know Mr. Gilmour are better suited to assess his words, and consequently his ideology, because they can do so from an objective moral high-ground? Well, I call BS. Interpreting anything at face value is a slippery slope. Pretty sure they call that “judging a book by its cover.” The author can, and should be given credit for providing at least some back story to Mr. Gilmour’s character. It does mitigate “the more repugnant aspects of his acknowledged ideology”, which is wonderful because they are fallacies. The irony of your statement is that those “repugnant aspects” have been subjectively and emotionally conjured up by the public. There is nothing to take away from Mr. Gilmour’s comments besides the obvious: he can’t connect with female or Chinese writers, Canadian literature, and therefore refuses to teach it in his elective course. But no, we must immediately assume the man a sexist, a racist, an oppressive, ignorant boor, who has no right to be educating our nation’s young minds. One pompous, relatively unknown Canadian author says a few marginally ignorant words about a few genres and writers and all of a sudden it’s a national outrage. Give me a break.

Or, perhaps, neither of you understands the basis of academic discourse. In any case, on a subjective basis Mr. Gilmour's quoted interview comments might be considered entirely appropriate amongst the boys over a few beers in a pub after a game of hockey. But what the public debate is not about is Mr. Gilmour's teaching ability or his popularity amongst his students, issues about which most readers of Mr. Gilmour's comments can or will, logically, know nothing. The author of the article acknowledges Mr. Gilmour's prejudices as his 'ideology,' which she apparently laments, but then recasts the terms of the debate in terms that most readers of Mr. Gilmour's comments don't have an ability to challenge. As such, she essentially reframes the debate in terms by which she intends to determine its outcome. This is called a rhetorical tautology, which according to the free online dictionary is 'a series of statements that form an argument, whereby the statements are constructed in such a way that the truth of the proposition is guaranteed or that, by defining a dissimilar or synonymous term in terms of another, the truth of the proposition or explanation cannot be disputed.' Hey, I can't argue her points that Mr. Gilmour is popular or that he's seen by his students as a challenging teacher, both of which are opinions that are in and of themselves inherently emotional and subjective, which, amusingly, is the exact basis of the criticism on which she initially assails the critics of Mr. Gilmour's comments.

I've followed the 'debate' closely. And only to those who are dubiously outraged by his comments does it “hinge” on whether his comments were 'legitimate' and 'appropriate'. We are talking about university. Academia. One of the last, dying bastions of free-speech we have left. The man is entitled to his opinions, and for anyone to read his comments and extrapolate that he is sexist or racist or unfit to teach is not only moronic, but it undermines one of the foundations of academia – namely, the right to have an alternative point of view and to express it freely without being mercilessly ostracized and unjustly labelled. Furthermore, we are dealing with literature -- a subject in which the term “objectivity” is avoided and regarded quite often as blasphemy. The fact that I even need to acknowledge this is absurd, but in your case I suppose it merits a nod.I find your comment “perhaps, neither of you understands the basis of academic discourse” highly amusing. How does having an alternative or unpopular point of view make one an offender of academic discourse? By your logic it would seem that academic discourse is defined as language only suitable to students who are extremely sensitive to anything that goes against the grain. I'm aware of what academic discourse is, and I don't require a charlatan, such as yourself, to explain it to me.Concerning your reference to 'rhetorical tautology': enough with the pretentious pontificating. The author didn't 'reframe' anything. She simply provided some colour to an issue that has been black and white up to this point. She provided a window, albeit small, into the character of the man whom the whole country has judged egregiously based on a few arrogantly phrased sentences. Frankly, I think it’s perfectly appropriate of the author to acknowledge that while Mr. Gilmour is a polarizing figure in his ideology, he is respectful of others' opinions or points of view, and allows them to defend their position in a way that is not alienating or personally judgmental. The irony here is that you're using 'facts' to create an argument over an issue that has absolutely nothing to do with facts or objectivity. The author wrote about her own personal experiences with Gilmour to illustrate his character. Period. There's no right or wrong answer to be taken away from that article. It was written so that others could use that context to formulate their own, subjective opinion about him. Critiquing that with rhetorical devices is just pedantic and sad.

Therein lies the problem. Such a theme - cultural forms, meaning and the modern mind - cannot be explored with any intellectual accuracy and legitimacy when the content is exclusive of roughly 90% of the population. My commentary has been consistent. I have no problem with David Gilmour giving a credited course that is so singular and exclusive. I actually don't have a problem with him not being to connect with any author other than manly white males (and might we add upper class persuasion for the most part).

He is what he is - and I can only feel a pity for a man who is so embraced within himself that he cannot feel empathy or form any connection with someone other than himself.

Selection of books for a mandatory and neutral literature course should be relatively unbiased. On the one hand, the best literature should be selected, on the other hand diverse literature should be selected. I'm not sure, however, there is any particular reason that the authors should be diverse. No doubt there is some correlation between diversity of author and diversity of literary content, but that is the only reason such a core course should give preference to female authors, for example. Imagine in a different subject area like physics or biology the idea of trying to teach material that was equally discovered by female and male scientists! Why should such a notion be considered any less absurd in literature? Moreover, this particular professor has no reason to even teach an unbiased course – he was hired explicitly for his bias, to teach the kind of literature he likes!

As you said, this is David Gilmore's bookself of works he loves.   The notion that the university should veto a professor teaching well what they love, or worse still forcing choices on that professor, is only likely to lower the value of what is being taught.  The gate-keeping this would start goes against the free nature of discussion you want to foster at a university.  Once that starts, I am willing to bet there will be no end to obstacle course a sincere bureacracy buttressed by caring opinion leaders would put in place.  Better not to start.  As long as the course description is clear, and it is an optional course, the students over the years will determine whether the course gets taught by voting with their attendance and their dollars.Mandatory survey courses for a degree (example given of American literature IIRC) is another matter and content is likely to be highly controlled by the department granting the degree already, so no need for further processes.Thanks again for your clear-headed article.",False,1380301469509,False,,0,[],,4,14563703,none,1,1380368724165,0,4,False,Site,wooly bully

But aside from being an insensitive thing to say, it was a pretty stupid thing that Gilmour said. Has he really read all the great women writers? Or Chinese writers (presumably in translation)? Obviously not. Literature is a way to connect with people and places and experiences that differ from our own, and to find a way to see beyond differences to those things that make us alike. All of us identify with certain works of fiction more than others.

Would you thus argue that because Canada turned away Jewish refugees in WW2, or because we forced Chinese migrants to work in slave-like conditions on the most dangerous parts of the CN railroad, that Canada should likewise not be considered a modern, democratic society? Right.2) Fact 5 is a pretty skewed interpretation of events. It was Greece's military junta that ordered the coup, with the aim of uniting all of Cyprus (including the many scattered areas where the Turks lived) with Greece itself. Thus Turkey's were initially consistent with the 1960 treaty. Fact 6 is at least partly true, so there's your first valid point. As for fact 7, lots of Greek Cypriots have emigrated to the UK as well; your point?3) Fact 8: Um... okay? Cyprus is 0% in Europe, and yet they have EU membership. Again, I'm not really sure what your point is.4) Fact 9: I really fail to see how this supports your argument at all, and if anything makes me less inclined to take you seriously. Bosnia and Herzegovina are 45% Muslim, and they are well on their way to EU membership. The EU has no religious affiliation (the likes of Merkel have tried and failed to change this) and should never favour one religious group over another. Turkey has had its issues with religion, but by and large they are a secular society and have been for longer than, say, Canada, the UK, or France.5) Fact 10: Okay, here's your second valid point. I completely agree that Turkey has progress to make when it comes to freedom of expression. But they have been making progress, and if Europe (particularly Germany) doesn't continue to explicitly state they will never want Turkey, they might even have incentive to keep going.So I agree that Turkey is not yet ready for full EU membership, but given their incredible diplomatic and economic potential, the depth of reform and development they have engaged in, and their cultural and historical ties to the rest of the European continent (to which they belong, despite your crude insinuations otherwise), it would be a mistake to cast them aside as so many would have us do.",False,1380401389958,False,05cd4710289d460ea8ec6e6f3bdb0d09,-1,[],,3,14565840,none,,0,0,2,False,Site,Common Nonsense

Supposed fact 1:True, Turkey unfortunately sided with Germany in WW I, but such a decision was a result of the corrupt and declining Ottoman Empire of the time, and the arrogant attitude of Britain which took hard earned money from Turkey for a dreadnought, but reneged on the deal at the outset of WW I before Turkey allied with Germany. Britain did not return the money which was raised by the populace of Turkey, and did not supply the ship. Germany then offered such to Turkey with of course the strings to support Germany and the Pasha and Ottoman hierarchy accepted. Fact 2: Turkey needed to protect and confirm its borders at the end of WW II from an aggressive Russia to avoid another debacle of western interference and Soviet occupation at the end of the war. In fact, Russia similarly declared war on Japan at the very end to extend its influence and possession of Japanese islands.Fact 3: Greece was occupying western Anatolia during WW I, and was given the area as an occupation zone in a divided Turkey after the war much the way Germany was divided into occupation zones after WW II. The British, French and Italian zones were surrendered shortly after to the new Turkey under Ataturk, but the Greeks wanted to annex western Anatolia as part of Greece. Turkey had to fight to throw the Greeks off their mainland. The Greeks were their enemy from 1914 to 1923. It was war!Fact 4: Turkey was fighting for its life against Russia in WW I and the Armenians sided with Russia, basically stabbing Turkey in the back. Armenian populations in western Turkey were not attacked.  It was messy and thousands of Armenians and Turks were killed, but it was not genocide! Fact 5: Cyprus is closer to Turkey than it is to Greece or any part of Europe. The Greeks wanted all of Cyprus, to annex it under the banner of ENOSIS (unity with Greece). Civil strife ensued and Turkey went over to protect the Turkish area of Northern Cyprus, a split which has not been resolved and just further complicated when Greece sponsored Cyprus for EU membership.Fact 6: Both Turkish people in the south and Greeks in the north were exchanged. Fact 7: There is an inconsistency in the accusation that thousands of Turkish settlers occupy 'stolen 'land, yet more than 50% of Turkish Cypriots supposedly emigrated to the U.K. (Any similarity to Palestinian and Israeli claims?)Fact 8: See my comments in Fact 5 in that at least part of Turkey is in Europe and as such can play a very beneficial role. Cyprus is nowhere near Europe! It is closer to Turkey, Syria Lebanon and Israel.Fact 9: So what?

I was on Lesvos this summer and was amused to be handed a menu which was only in Greek and Turkish.The first world war was a terrible time for everyone, the Ottoman Empire included.  While the West invaded from the West (Gallipoli) the Russians invaded from the East and the Armenians in the east rose up to try to claim independence from the Ottoman Empire as many others did before them.  Hundreds of thousands died; Armenians, Turks, Russians and Kurds, mostly of starvation and cold including most of the Ottoman soldiers who deployed.  It wasn't a genocide, it was a war and civil war and most of the Armenians died on the march while being 'Ethnically Cleansed' from the area due to lack of provisions which the Ottomans were supposed to provide but didn't and couldn't - they should have realized that and it was criminal not too.  The Armenians at that time made up a significant proportion of the population, especially in the East and in Istanbul.  Some Armenians in Istanbul rose up too, but not too many and there was no large scale persecution of Armenians in Istanbul.It was 'Enosis' the union with Greece which was promoted by the Archbishop Makarios and the junta of army colonels which ruled at the time that caused Cyprus to explode.  Such a union was prohibited by the constitution which the British left in place, part of which was that the Greeks, Turks and British were guarantors of the constitution.  The Greeks made up 2/3 of the population, the situation was out of hand when Turkey invoked it's right to act according to the constitution and invaded.  They took the predominantly Turkish Cypriot northern part and then stopped.  Look at the map and also realize that Turkey's population and armed forces were a lot stronger than those of the combined forces of Cyprus and Greece.  Turkey could have continued and taken the entire island - but they stopped.  The EU made a huge mistake when they let Greek Cyprus into the EU, they should have said 'unify your island then come and talk to us'.  That would have ended the problem.  Instead they said we'll solved the problems after we join, then in an EU/UN sponsored referendum designed to unify the island under a Greek Cypriot President and a Turkish Cypriot PM, the Greeks voted no and the Turks yes, much to the embarrassment of the EU.  So enough about the Turks invading.The head of Greek Orthodox Church is in Istanbul, Turkey.

Presumably, those who support Mr. Gilmour's right to 'free speech,' believe that his particular preferences, described variously over the past few days as misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia, serve as some sort of antidote to the feminists and other fringe groups who are running rampant on Canadian university campuses. To me, this is odd. Wouldn't the enemy of extremism of any kind be moderation? Mr. Gilmour's views, as reported, would hardly appear to be moderate. I haven't been on a university campus for decades. It is possible that arts and humanities faculties have been high-jacked by special interests. The argument of the PC-bashers, though, appears to be that the special interest that Mr. Gilmour appears to represent (i.e. 'serious' heterosexual guy-guys) deserves equal time on campus. But doesn't this simply reinforce rather than break down the special interest model that we are so often told has taken over academia - or at least the soft underbelly of academia that is represented by the arts and humanities?

I witnessed the advent of the latter on campus twenty to twenty-five years ago, where minorities---who were somehow represented largely by affluent white females---were promoted at all costs. The ardent desire to facilitate gender and racial equality on campus has spawned the growth of African-Canadian, Native American and Women's studies which, frankly, exists on a political rather than an academic rationale. Certainly, this can't be defended on academic grounds. What's more, I've seen more than a few abject failures as academics hailing from aforementioned departments.Nevertheless, this outrage obscures the fact that feminism and political correctness also arose out of reaction to white male hegemony on campus. Sadly, I also saw the ugly side of that. I earned a graduate degree in history from a department which was a bastion of sexism, and one that was populated by many WASP ciphers who masqueraded as scholars.

They were not seeking an 'education', so as to satisfy some, or other, exogenous qualification, approval, or find a job. In fact, universities then, were harbours for those who were seeking to penetrate the mysterious, hidden within the prosaic. They were seeking to understand rather than to know. They had questions not certainties. Nowadays universities have become like churches had become in the 16th and 17th centuries ... stale promulgators of the received. Of course the received is a contrivance. The content has been carefully edited. Omissions are intentional. Paragraphs are structured to emphasize one thing at the expense of the whole thing and excise counter factual qualifiers.The university became the place to seek understanding because unlike religion there was no received dogma. The church then was an instrument of the state. The church reinforced the ideology of the state. Of course in order to qualify for membership in the state heirarchy one had to have imbibed the 'dialectic' of the prevailing religious establishment -- one had to belong -- if one wanted to belong; and of course most people tend to want to belong. By the time most people did 'belong' the church no longer fulfilled its originating impulse. Sure everyone could repeat the dogma chapter and verse but enlightenment resided only in the shadows. The message became dilute. In fact those with mastery were expelled.As to understanding, which requires freedom to ask questions, questioning was forbidden. Dogma prevailed over transcendence. Those with 'real' questions had to seek understanding elsewhere. Enlightenment had been privatized. One is more likely to find enlightenment without a church than with one.Much of the same can be understood to have happened within universities. The promise of enlightenment therein has become a lie. Rather than enlightenment ... universities fail to deliver it. Like churches during the ages of their genesis, when they may have refused entrance to 'swine', for fear of diluting their essence to the point of nonsense -- which ultimately happened -- universities no longer aid, or seek to aid, those now warming up the seats in those hallowed halls, to develop their faculties. Professors preach a received brand of dogma and only hand out credentials to the dogmatic. Not so much in the hard sciences, like medicine, engineering, and science, you may think, but bifurcation is not absolute. Quotas and rationing, and allowing for gender and race accommodation, are where the peculiar dogmas of the social sciences tend to do the most damage. There are few people who do not know of someone who has not been accepted in the disipline of their choice because of 'quotas'...Granted, those who are driven by some inner impulse to seek knowledge, understanding, and enlightenment, may seem to be few but the question is; why are they so few?",False,1380571576148,False,,2,[],,1,14570359,none,1,1380571576148,0,3,False,Site,Werpor

The effect of this long-running lack of objectivity and balance is, I think, to create in ideological feminists’ minds an entrenched and immutable perception that no other view is possible and that oppression against women is not whimsy but widely accepted fact that is completely beyond dispute.In this atmosphere over time, many feminists have, I believe, unconsciously built up such a fragility that a view contrary to their own often inflames them and renders them utterly unreceptive to that view. The views of such people as Warren Farrell are practically guaranteed to inflame and anger these feminists, who throughout their adult life have been fed by the intellectually dishonest media the “incontrovertible fact” of oppression against women.For the views most feminists try to suppress, see:“The Doctrinaire Institute for Women's Policy Research: A Comprehensive Look at Gender Equality”http://malemattersusa.wordpress.com/2012/02/16/the-doctrinaire-institute-for-womens-policy-research/",False,1380648680481,False,,0,[],,1,14570359,none,,1380648680481,0,1,False,Site,Male Matters

It's not often that a comedy duo consists of TWO top bananas. Apparently egdusa isn't aware that innovation isn't limited to inventions and material things.

None of them *invented* anything as such and what they did might not be to your liking or mine, but nonetheless all were and remain highly innovative practitioners in their respective disciplines. And they were all Canadians.egdusa also appears unaware that Fargo and Grand Forks get just as cold as Winnipeg and that Juneau, Fairbanks, and Anchorage get just as cold as, and possibly colder than, Churchill. But he nonetheless drags out his oft-repeated tired old gag about Canadians living in igloos. And just the one igloo, egdusa, for all of us Canadians?

Even if it were my intent, there's nothing I could write that could conceivably embarrass good ol' Elroy any more than he's repeatedly embarrassed himself on these boards. The only thing I can add is that when a person feels the need to repeat the same-old, same-old comments that he's already made thousands of times on these boards as Jetson does, that's indicative of a person whose intellect has fossilized. Not only is it the antithesis of innovative thinking, but it spares the person having to think at all. It must really gall both of you that several of America's most innovative thinkers and doers were in fact born, raised, and educated in other countries around the world, including Canada. If they became Americans at all, they did so AFTER the fact. The US might lay claim to the products of their intellect, but it didn't have anything to do with how they were brought up to think. Speaking of which, tell me, Jetson, have you ever had an original idea that you've developed and refined into a workable product? Or does your intellect (such as it is) shut down when faced with anything more demanding than bad-mouthing Canadians and scouring the Internet for anything and everything negative about Canada? All the pair of you have demonstrated with your posts (Jetson more so than egduse) is your petty, malicious bigotry. And when a person runs down people he's never even met as often as Jetson does and for no better reason than to build himself up by dissociation from them rather than from his own achievements, there's only one word I can think of to describe him (all right, I can think of more than one word, but this one's the most apt): loser.

Neither Mintz or his Ilk have gone so far as to suggest the abolition of Progressive Income Taxation---as is the Clarion of some--especially South of here.The documented gapping of the 99% by the 1%, bringing about a diminution in size of the Middle Class, does not appear to bother these Board Game Players, let alone a beep from said Sages about the obscenity of CEO self-determined wages, and the Boards who hug them.A sales tax once enshrined in the Code, can only go up. And it will do so for as long as that faction whose interests it serves, maintains that we do not have a spending problem. Reducing taxes on the other hand, will ever so subtly be taken away---as witness the travel path of the dividend tax credit(the scam of eligible vs ineligible aside), that was a moral fix for double taxation, but was never and could never have been left alone.A big break for the Middle Class is that the Politicians will eventually throw some crumbs their way, the reason being that the vote count is highest in that demographic.A surtax was used a time ago, to atone for Governments' wastage of the Peoples' Money, and it worked.

Simply put, it is the only direct way every Albertan benefits from our oil and gas wealth. Simpson ignores, however, the real culprit in Alberta's budget struggle, and also the benefits that flow from the lack of a PST/HST. First, our budget became decidedly more tied to the ups and downs of oil/gas prices after Day/Klein introduced the flat income tax for Albertans over a decade ago. This is a great innovation for high income earners, of which this province has a higher proportion than any other. So, Simpson's solution is to buy into Mintz's Kool-Aid to penalize the lower and middle classes in Alberta to give more breaks to the upper income earners. GST was a needed national initiative to replace a series of economically detrimental taxes (FST, etc.). Harper should NOT have dropped 2% in his first terms in office (basically we've been in a federal deficit since).  But the Alberta economy is strong in large part BECAUSE THERE IS NO PST (there are lots of other user fees and taxes already, thank you very much). We do have a bit of a govt spending problem (civil servant and teacher salaries, as well as research university academic staff and senior admins, and now among the highest in the country) and we also have a bit of a revenue problem, but if we went back to a simple progressive income tax system and starting to tax earnings above $120k slightly more (say, a 15% bracket on earnings above $120k rather than 10%), our fiscal rollercoaster would be smoothed out.

The 'sales tax solution' has not worked in most European countries.  For example, the French Government has been adding to its federal debt for forty years and there is no sign that this trend will change.  France has a very high sales tax (almost 20%) and sound business investment has been decreasing for many years.Reduction in Government expenditures is the only sensible way to fix the economy and encourage sound, business investment.  The government over-expenditure trend that Canada (federally and provincially) and other Western Nations have been following over the past forty to fifty years is leading us into economic disaster.  The last economic recession is only  prelude to what is about to happen in the near future.In Canada, total Federal, Provincial and Municipal debt is more than one trillion dollars or approximately $118,000 for every four member family.  Add personal debt (including mortgages, household loans and credit cards) and it doesn't take long to realize that we are in deep trouble.

Of the 3 elements for survival – renewable land, renewable water, renewable heat, it lacks the 3rd – the daily warm sun.Food crisis has lasted already 1000 years. From 11th century land ran out and overpopulated Europe could not feed itself onward. Trade became necessary, but Kaliphate (effectively tariff piracy) was milking worldwide trade. To loosen Muslim grip Crusade adventurism only worsened the matter for Europe. There were 100 famines in 75 straddling 1300 AD.And when in 15th century the short-sighted Ottomans blocked the trade routes altogether, desperate Europe had to spurn agrarian Christianity (Catholic) turning to Protestantism and Democracy, rule of the moneyed Demos, thus to Corporate Capitalism and organized violence to survive. Says so factually the West’s Prophet of Doom Samuel Huntington:” .. The West won the world not by the superiority of its ideas or values or religion, but rather by its superiority in applying organized violence. Westerners often forget this fact, non-Westerners never do ” —— The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order, p. 51. ..With new routes and new lands Europe survived for 200 years until their own white colonists booted them out of the new lands (Americas).Milking non-white colonies paid the bills for another 100 years. But by 1900 Europe again could not feed itself. So, it had to kill 120,000,000 of its own in WWI, WWII, Concentration camps, and gulags, plus allegedly 6,000,000 of non-European race who was held responsible, rightly or wrongly, for Europe’s economic woes.The 31 years of carnage (1914-45) in Europe that killed 1 in 4 was the ultimate inter-Christian rivalry between largely feudal Catholic Axis powers and largely trading Protestant and Orthodox Allies Powers (barring occupied lands).Axis PowersCatholic GermanyCatholic ItalyCatholic Vichy FranceCatholic PopeCatholic Fascist Spain (sympathizer)Catholic Fascist Portugal (sympathizer)Catholic French Canada (sympathizer)Etc.Allied PowersProtestant BritainProtestant AmericaProtestant English CanadaProtestant AustraliaProtestant DenmarkProtestant NetherlandsOrthodox RussiaEtc.Almost all Nazis were rabid Catholics, and the Pope was with them.While Europe chose moneyed Demos, America for a while chose Socrates’ Republic, the egalitarian govt of the people, for the people, for the people, run by the learned. But in 1920s under the Administrations of moneyed Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover it too lost its Republican soul and morphed into Democracy.While the West wallows in misery under the rule of the moneyed Demos, Asia flourishes under Socratic rule of the learned.

I have been in business in Ontario over twenty years and in my the trade for over 35.I work in a voluntary structural trade, (a trade where no certification is needed to preform work).   I was previously in my trade’s union. I have seen the construction industry from most levels.     The union in my trade was set up as a competition. Survival of the strong.  The foreman on any given day could lay off any worker he chose. (As long as he kept a 1:1 ratio between workers that came off the list and requested workers).  From the moment you started a new Job there was rumors of impending layoffs. The stress this system creates is brutal.  On average it takes about 15 years to become fully skilled in my trade. The result is the young tradespeople keep getting laid off.I started my company to market my skills when the union did nothave work.    I knew enough not to grow my company and become a union target. One by one my competitors grew were certified by the union and disappeared. I equate this action by the Union to a corporation destroying family farms.The construction trade unions now operate government funded     training centres to address the shortage of skilled trades. In myOpinion the unions are the entity responsible for the shortage in the first place.I believe the union’s pre-apprenticeship programs are funded by employment insurance and the students have to claim 7or 8 thousand of taxable income for taking the course. I would like to know the statistics of the success rate of these courses. Keep in mindthat many of these students have ties with union members and wouldhave entered the trade anyways.As a business owner who has watched the union certification process destroy a lot of construction companies.  I would be very hesitant to hire a student from these courses. Why can’t the jobs grant money be spent funding apprentices on the jobsite instead of pre-apprentices at the Union Hall.The lost issue is the fact Ontario does not require certification forsome structural trades. This issue should be dealt immediately.There are a lot of good hardworking people taking on jobs the simply shouldn’t.

In Canada it also meant geographical mobility as young people moved from the Prairie provinces to primarily Ontario and BC. It seems strange now that there is so much grumbling when workers may have to move back to the West to find jobs.Part of the answer is that farmers are truly independent and were never part of an EI system or a social movement which would restrain the free movement of labour. I do agree with the Senator when she says that money spent on training should be increased rather than focussing on long term benefits for those not working. The training should be mandatory for those who are regularly unemployed so that the chronically unemployed are able to get back into the labour force.

That does not mean I am in favour of this for the EI program.As noted by others, some provinces, and particularly Quebec, have setup innumerable barriers to inter-provincial movement of labour, generally due to provincial licencing requirements.  The provincial requirements have always been an issue for immigrants to Canada.  I understand they are equally a barrier for migration within Canada.I object to putting EI payments within the hands of the provinces particularly in the case of Quebec, whose government will then do anything possible to prevent labour migration to or from Quebec in service of the political goal of separation.As for training funds, great idea, BUT no funds to go to a province that does not agree to joint qualifications in that area of training.  To use an example from another commenter:  If Alberta and Ontario agree the qualifications for welders are inter-changeable, provide federal training funds for welding only.  Provinces will then naturally complain federal govenment is interfering in provincial jurisdiction.   The provinces can then explain why a welder is not a welder except geographically.I really like subsidiarity (pushing regulation down to provinces) but really hate the petty liciencing monopolies and protected labour markets that generates.

I live in the west (not the Alberta-Saskatchewan west, the other West, to the west of them) and not in the maritimes.My first experience was horrible.  I was wrongfully terminated after 2100 hrs of insured service.  Despite successfully suing my employer via Employment Standards, I never did receive the benefits to which I was entitled, and was forced to trudge from the EI office to the provinicial welfare office to get a form stamped, and to trudge back to get that stamped by the EI office, then back to the welfare office to get my money.  I'm probably entitled to backpay for that time; but it was easier to just eventually find another job.  Laughably, when I took some PT courses to finish my high school while looking for work, I was chastized for doing so.2nd and 3rd times werent so bad.  I got a severance package so I had to wait for 3 weeks plus two and a half months as they calculated my severance as part of their coverage that I and my employer had paid for.  Nice.  EI also neglected to inform me that the new BC MSP premium was not being paid for through them as it was through my employer.  The BC government neglected to send me a bill until years later, when I owed $5,000+.  I had never moved nor changed my phone number.The way to fix EI is this: For one, get the benefits approved immediately.  This three week wait until you an receive a dime is stupid and counterproductive.  The best time to start looking for work is immediately after your last day of work.  Your contacts are fresher, you are more used to putting in a full day.  Employers often drag their feet on getting you your ROE despite the 48 hour requirement, so those not in the racket of habitually collecting EI may not realize that that 2 week lag for the employer to get them this peice of paper will run them into the poorhouse (no income for 5 weeks?).  Rapid approval would reduce the clog in the offices.  Save that time and energy for complex cases.Second is to have a lump sum payout for finding work at a similar compensation level before the claim is exhausted.  If you get 8 months of loafing on the couch drinking beer, why would you bother to get a job more quickly?  If you could get 80% of the value of the rest of your claim for finding work quickly, most people would take the cheque.Finally, there needs to be a moving allowance for moving from one region to another if it can be proven that job prospects there are better.  This amount could be removed from the *end* of the claim.  In the NWT, there are communities with a 2% unemployment rate (mat leave) and the real effective minimum wage is $25 an hour.  Unfortunately, it costs about $2000 to pack up and move there.

It can't be used irresponsibly.  You have to spend it as carefully as if it were coming out of your own pocket - which, ultimately, it is.Toronto has an embarrassment of riches when it comes to transit assets.Many of those assets are not being used anywhere near their potential.Before we go spending new money on very expensive projects of dubious merit, we should make sure that we are making the most of existing resources.At the top of the list of bad expenditures are un-needed tunnels.  Because of their exorbitant cost, you only bore tunnels where there is no other alternative.At present, the two most wasteful proposed squanderings of public funds, are(1) boring twin-tunnels to STC (and beyond!); and(2) running the DRL N-S through Pape.On the first one, Scarborough needs a lateral train, and an alternative to the B-D: two (or more) straws for the milkshake, not one extra-long straw.But, for the sake of political vanity some people are determined to bore unnecessary tunnels to STC, no matter what it costs.  Whether it provides cost-effective transit is apparently irrelevant.On the second one, the ostensible justification is that it will provide relief to both the east end of the B-D and for the Yonge line.  But Pape is too far west to help the B-D, and too far east to help the Yonge line.  It will cost a fortune and do neither job well.  That plan originated when the city had 1.5 m, not the 6.5 m it now has.At far less cost the city can build two eastern ends of the DRL, one through Danforth station, and another direct to Don Mills, then Wexford: twice as much capacity, serve far more people, provide real downtown relief, cost far less. Avoid 5 or 6 km of tunnels, and might avoid an extremely expensive below-water-table tunnel under the Don River.It is as if they want to build a Don Mills subway, for the sake of building a Don Mills subway, no matter what it costs, no matter that the city has (at least) tripled in size since 1965, and no matter what other alternatives exist.

Mr Gee has at least come out here, talked to some residents and done some thinking for himself.I wish he he had commented on Lawrence Avenue East. The 400 m walk from the bus stop to the Lawrence entrance of the future LRT is absurd from a personal safety, health and convenience pov. Add to that that the drive from that SRT/LRT station to the proposed McCowan road subway station is seven minutes (on a Sunday afternoon). By bus during rush hour it would probably be longer due to passenger boarding delays. The subway stop at McCowan would resolve both of those problems, and save people connecting as much as 12-15 minutes.

Approximating the numbers from public data and being optimistic, that's only about 1500-2000 riders per day.

When the City/TTC projected  2031 Scarborough 'subway' ridership at 14,000 pphpd, i.e., sounding far superior to the 8,000 pphpd estimate used for a Scarborough LRT, they state that they came up with that estimate by assuming there would be a DRL built if a Scarborough extension was built, but they did NOT use this same assumption to re-estimate peak ridership on the dedicated-guideway LRT. That one thing makes turns these two numbers into apples and oranges. Please correct if this reading is erroneous, but if it is in fact true, then anyone in a position of public trust continuing to make the false comparison is guilty of either gross intellectual laziness or bamboozling, and in a big way. Love to be shown wrong on this. I believe that what the good folks of Scarborough absolutely deserve is Equal Service delivery, not merely Equal Equipment and, by manipulating numbers to toxify public opinion regarding LRT's, by misinforming the public into accepting politically-motivated investments in 'subways,subways,subways', crass populist politicians of all stripes are disserving their constituents in Scarborough,Toronto, Ontario, and Canada.

Of course parents play a major part in how children develop their self-esteem.  This is all about the 'big dollars' that are tied up in these pageants.  The sponsors are in it to make a buck and some parents just think their toddlers are above the rest and it usually the mother who is trying to bolster her OWN self-esteem by putting her 'adorable' and 'special' child on display.  As Reverend King stated he wanted his children to be judged by their 'character' not the colour of their skin.  Or put another way - the beauty of their appearance.  It sends a shallow message of 'oh look at me I'm Sandra Dee' I'm the most beautiful.  Just ask parents whose daughters 'starve' themselves to look like the air-brushed models in magazines and Hollywood.  Child beauty pageants are a form of 'child abuse'.  Jon Benet Ramsay was a perfect example of that.  Her mother never made Miss USA and she forced her daughter into the 'business' because she believed by starting early Jon Benet just might grab the brass wing.

His formative training was in Poland and he maintained links with Polish expats in Paris, however, he is known for his years in France and he became a French citizen.

He spent more than half his life in London.  And, although buried there, and the importance of his years there is recognized, nobody, but nobody in London or anywhere else thinks of Karl Marx as English.  He died without official nationality and is generally referred to as being German.It strikes me that the concept that Mr. Ignatieff calls himself Canadian is in line with how people have often viewed nationality in recent history, and it's nonsense to challenge this.

I refused help from the Embassy, I got rid of my Quebec Medicare card in 1985,  I pay out of state fishing licence, etc… and I am a “pure laine” French Canadian who has his Canadianism literally in his DNA. So honestly, yes, there are two kinds of Canadians: those living in Canada and paying taxes, and those living abroad who should not be entitled to anything besides a passport. If we do not enforce this, then we might as well tax all Canadians like the Yanks do. (A despicable practice since we should pay tax in the country where we use the resources irrespective of our citizenship; but we should not expect preferential treatment either.)",False,1380418652983,False,ad3d3cf5b513468a90b0b78f5296e408,6,[],,3,14588210,none,,0,0,9,False,Site,Nishikawa

Typical Canadian story. His return to Canada for an adventure in politics was marred by the fact he was the choice of 'the Liberal Backroom boys'. When someone returns to Canada after a 30-year absence, believing that he will become the leader of a national political party, possibly even the Prime Minister ... well, that doesn't work too well anywhere.  Not even in Pakistan to which exiled leaders often return with fond memories ... Benazir Bhutto is only one tragic example.It's a funny question, 'Who is Canadian?' Politicians have been trampling on the concept of Canadian nationality since 1946, when Canada introduced its own Citizenship Act for the FIRST time. It turned out that Canadians weren't 'British citizens' living in a colony after all. Politicians seem to have been apologizing for recognizing domestic citizenship ever since.If we visit other countries, we find their citizens define themselves, usually by their country of birth, though sometimes their country doesn't officially exist anymore, or it may not yet be a reality (Khalistan, for instance). Still, those citizens cling doggedly to the citizenship of their homelands, even if they migrate to Canada.  That's when their former homeland gets place of preference in FRONT of the hyphen, as in 'Homeland'-Canadian, eh? In surveys, StatsCan doesn't really allow a specific Canadian designation, preferring to inquire about ancestral or tribal lineage ... or, you can fill in Canadian for 'other'. I wonder how the federal government will celebrate the 100th anniversary of Canada's Citizenship Act in 2046.  For some reason, I always have the feeling that Canada's federal government never really wanted to surrender colonial status.  After Britain, Canada tied its coattails to the USA.  When the American economy seemed to stumble, Canada was almost begging China to take over.  Whenever Canadian politicians start trotting around the world to beg for free trade agreements, they seem to want to abdicate any responsibility for the domestic economy.  Sometimes, it makes me wonder why Canada even bothers to have federal elections and a federal level of government.",False,1380379850763,False,,3,[],,5,14588210,none,1,1380470437063,0,8,False,Site,Vic E

As a professional, I enjoyed essentially the same working conditions and benefits in both countries.  Vacation, sick leave, social insurance/security, disability, and medical insurance, etc.  The standard work week is 40 hours - common in the private sector in both nations.  This is true not just for professionals in the states, but most anyone in a skilled occupation or full-time semi-skilled job.  Its true, there is almost no such thing in the states as our 35-hour public sector work week.  And, there are a few differences - in the U.S., I had a deductible, but I also paid lower taxes. Where things are different in the states is for the unskilled workforce - who often work part-to-full time with no insurance, vacation or sick leave - a result as you point out of different policies driven by different values, and certainly one of the things that bugged me greatly about the U.S.  No doubt you can talk on about other differences, but really the U.S. is not all Detroit or one of the reality TV shows and for the most past, on a day to day basis, as yotphix says, is barely distinguishable from Canada and vice versa, with so many of us having family on both sides of the border.

They are proclaiming increased confidence in their models as the discrepancies between their models and observations increase.Their excuse for the absence of warming over the past 17 years is that the heat is hiding in the deep ocean.  However, this is simply an admission that the models fail to simulate the exchanges of heat between the surface layers and the deeper oceans.  However, it is this heat transport that plays a major role in natural internal variability of climate, and the IPCC assertions that observed warming can be attributed to man depend crucially on their assertion that these models accurately simulate natural internal variability.  Thus, they now, somewhat obscurely, admit that their crucial assumption was totally unjustified.Finally, in attributing warming to man, they fail to point out that the warming has been small, and totally consistent with there their being nothing to be alarmed about.

Perhaps if they read and tried to understand what others are saying, rather than trying to find ways of undermining the credibility of those who are saying it, they might rant less. One can but hope.It has become increasingly clear that naming any individual dissenter amongst the ranks of scientists is merely affording the opportunity for the most vociferous proponents of AGW to try to distort the argument by focusing on the attributes of the messenger while ignoring the substance of the message. Much as, in past centuries, scientists were derided for daring to question the beliefs of the Church, the new breed of quasi-scientists and their followers seek to silence those who dare to question their orthodoxy.Having not referenced the study by Fyfe et al. previously, I will do so now:'Recent observed global warming is significantly less than that simulated by climate models. This difference might be explained by some combination of errors in external forcing, model response and internal climate variability.' I can't reproduce Figure 1 from their report here, but it really doesn't inspire confidence in the computer models. The only certainty is that the models got it significantly wrong. Everything else is mere speculation.The thread was started with a sense of humour, something that is evidently lacking in AGW proponents. The IPCC could have said 'We got it wrong, we need more time to study the climate and construct more accurate models.' Instead, they chose to deny their mistakes, and their disciples respond by trying to vilify the skeptics. Spreading doubt is an attribute of someone with an open mind, contrary to what someone who believes that consensus-equals-truth might write.

You see, there are uncertainties in our models that we know about, and uncertainties that we don't know about. We alter the boundaries to incorporate the uncertainties that we only find after the observations have been made.'So, the range of uncertainty can be how big?'As big as it needs to be to ensure that the observations always fall within the boundary of uncertainty predicted by our models.'Are you sure about that?'Absolutely.'And the discrepancy between short term and long term trends?'Our models are excellent at predicting long term trends, but not so good with short terms.

Some are calling it a global melt down in trust in science. Climate-gate, IPCC, NASA, H1N1 has helped to undermine the credibility of science.Public opinion poles reflect this change in attitude. Science is at a loss as to how to restore confidence.The combination of digital access and press sensationalism has largely sabotaged the process of scientific review as it relates to the general public.In the past, publication was the method for introducing a new concept to only the scientific community at large, so that the much more rigorous post publication peer review could begin. This process involves critiques, citations, reproduction of experiments and additional studies and can take years before a consensus is achieved as to whether or not the original conclusions were valid.We are bombarded with New Studies at, or even before their initial publication. Highly respected scientific journals can be reviewed by a few members acting as anonymous referees for the editor. This peer review is to establish acceptability, but not necessarily validity of the study. This review does not necessarily endorse the conclusions.IPCC was a prime example of this new breed of political science.Some stated peer reviewed facts were presented to the public:Himalayan meltdown by 2035 resulting in 60 million people suffering from food security.50% in loss of African agriculture.55% of Netherlands below sea level.40% of the Amazon rainforests wiped out.Increase in natural disastersMan made CO2 is a greater threat to mankind than water vapor in the atmosphere.The conclusions are clear:The U.N. climate panel (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)) should only make predictions when it has solid evidence and should avoid policy advocacy. Straying into advocacy can only hurt science credibility.The IPCCs work, contains many statements that were assigned high confidence but for which there is little evidence.IPCCs response to errors when they were subsequently revealed was slow and inadequate.The review also called for an overhaul of the panels management, including the creation of an executive committee that would include people from outside the IPCC.Some are calling for the dismantling of IPCC.",False,1380397420934,False,,3,[],,5,14588647,none,3,1380402971353,0,8,False,Site,Dick Garneau

There are too many random factors that can't be predicted, like volcanoes and ENSO episodes.  We can’t even measure the observed climate accurately over such short periods so there is nothing to validate models against.  We can only compare to multiple future decades.When climate models are controlled to use the exact real world timing of random events in hindcast runs, they reproduce the past climate remarkably well.  The random factors are known to have no long term effect on climate, therefore scientists have confidence that models project future climate similarly well within a certain range or envelope of potential climates.Since the models already work, there is no reason to 'change the ensembles to fit the curve'.",False,1380494092466,False,98037e89a1954cf2ad7153049fe8b6a6,2,[],,,14588647,none,,0,0,2,False,Site,SoundOff

The methodology is based on the sum of the squared residuals from some proposed trend line and the best fit trend line is the one that minimized that sum.  Consequently, as more data points are added to the data, the whole weighting is shifted and a completely different trend can emerge.  This is true for climate data until you have about 30 years of data.  Adding a little more data won’t alter the trend anymore (hence the reason for using 30 years of data).  The right number of data points depends on the inherent noise in that type of data.I read somewhere that if the next 15 years of global warming increase at even the rate of the last decade, then the new 30-year trend will align with the climate model mean again (the last decade has many big numbers but no standouts among its peers like 1998 was).  I do see past apparently flat periods suddenly returning to trend with the addition of a few normal data points.  It takes quite a few additional data points on one end of a data set to change the trend when a very large data point is sitting on the other end of the data set, as is the case with the last 15 years or so.",False,1380509724148,False,3293052393cf4077b1e68c535b805396,1,[],,2,14588647,none,,0,0,3,False,Site,SoundOff

If the climate had been constantly changing, such a heavy investment in infrastructure would have made no sense, and humans would have continued their nomadic tribal ways.Civilization is now threatened by the most rapid climate change ever observed in the recent or distant past.

Each time another IPCC report comes out, we all say 'Okay, NOW we know (and so implicitly we didn't know before.)' Each time we do that, we generously extend the olive branch to the denial industry and exonerate them, and ourselves, for not having done anything until now, just like how every time Charlie Brown pretends that Lucy hasn't yanked the football away every time before. We pretend that the denial industry has been motivated by genuine doubt, not naked self interest, and that somehow NOW we've reached that magical threshold of proof that will allow us to all agree to move forward.I think we need to pass laws that make wilfully spreading misinformation about climate change a crime, much the same as we criminalize Holocaust denial. (I'm sorry to do the Internet thing and bring Nazis into it, but it's a strong precedent. Well, the strongest we have, considering that climate change might kill six billion people, making it potentially as bad as a thousand Holocausts.) Of course, until the evidence starts to really roll in, in the form of permanently ruined coastal cities and millions of refugees (for starters) there probably won't be the momentum to punish those who lied to us for so long. But you can't make laws retroactively, so we need to make it a crime--a serious one--now.Incidentally, this should be perfectly acceptable to climate 'skeptics' because it means that if their side of the story turns out to be the accurate one, it would be the 'climate change hysterics' who would turn out to be the criminals, and they who would be punished for causing such a fuss needlessly. If the climate skeptics truly have the courage of their convictions, they should push for a very strong penalty for willfully spreading misinformation about climate change.Anyway, for the time being, stop enabling the scoundrels with our dishonest pretense that somehow we didn't know before.

It is of course referenced in AR4:http://ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/figure-9-1.html 'Zonal mean atmospheric temperature change from 1890 to 1999 (°C per century) as simulated by the PCM model from (a) solar forcing, (b) volcanoes, (c) well-mixed greenhouse gases, (d) tropospheric and stratospheric ozone changes, (e) direct sulphate aerosol forcing and (f) the sum of all forcings.'-----So this TMT Hot Spot in the models corresponds to the enhanced adiabatic lapse rate of evaporated water, at the 10,000 M altitude, but that surely describes the attribution for the capacity for such heat transfer. As I see it the TMT Hot Spot is merely given dominant attribution by greenhouse forcing in those graphs (c: well-mixed greenhouse gases), but is not in itself a fingerprint of AGW, just that GHG is the single largest positive forcing attributable (among forcings in the other graph panels which are negative and therefore not causally efficient). As I see it this is an attribution issue for which there will never be a consistent instrumental record; it describes a Hot Spot capacity, not some consistently elevated temps anomalies at that altitude/lat band 24/7/365.  Although anomalously hot conditions will have a large AGW attribution that is not, a priori, a conditional proof of AGW (especially b/c it's not always there).

I’ve seen the AR4 Figure 9.1 several times before.The general idea is that any kind of warming should show up as an increasing trend in the Hot Spot or TMT region over a long period of time, or a noticeable Hot Spot when plotted in the IPCC manner.  If we don’t observe that phenomenon, then either the climate is not really warming or our understanding of climate thermo-physics (as expressed in models) is not correct.  Both of these conclusions play into the skeptics’ weak hand.We have observed a Hot Spot appearing after sudden warming jumps, like during El Niños, but I think we have not yet observed an ongoing one caused by general climate warming.  It doesn’t mean it’s not there, it’s just not been observed yet (because it is something that’s very difficult to measure against the noise over the present 33-year life of satellite records, IPCC uses 100+ years of model data in Figure 9.1).  On the other hand, perhaps it should be understood as an intermittent phenomenon – just a capacity that get used occasionally, which is what I think Walrus Jr. is getting at.  I don’t know enough about this phenomenon to confirm that.  But this is a digression from what’s important.I agreed neither conclusion refutes AGW at all.  The first one just refutes climate warming of any type (if the period is long enough, even longer with intermittency) and the second one refutes climate models ability to replicate warming properly (in a very narrow area of the atmosphere).Warming of the climate system (from whatever cause) is indisputable so the ‘no warming’ conclusion makes no sense but I’m sure Spencer is quite happy to let his readers form this incorrect conclusion.I believe the main purpose of the plot is an attempt to refute models ability to replicate warming properly.  The problem here is that we lack precise observational data (per my earlier reply), which means the comparison presented in the plot is not meaningful.  The model trends may or may not be accurate.  We don’t know.  If the TMT Hot Spot is an intermittent phenomenon, then it only makes sense that the different observations would vary so much, and the plot comparison is a completely useless exercise over only 33 years.That’s my understanding of the Spencer (or Christy) plot issue.  I’ve probably just restated much of what Walrus Jr. said more eloquently than me and in a more technically precise way than me.

Michael Mann fought tooth and nail to protect his data sets and algorithms from being analyzed by McIntyre & McKitrick who proved his Hockey Stick Theory wrong and was intentionally corrupted to always show results that supported the theory. Don't even get me started on Climategate ..... and I know you'll point to the rigged inquiries made up of same-minded scientists and peers who absolved them of any wrongdoing. Again, that's like Chretien who appointed a close personal friend as 'Ethics Commissioner' who absolved him of any wrongdoing when he strongarmed and used political influence during Shawinigate to sell his golf course on a bloody table napkin. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. The scientists at the top of the AGW pyramid are corrupt and will do anything to protect their theories that put them at the top despite their science falling apart. For 17 years other credible scientists have been trying to point to the flaws in their science and models to reopen discussion and focus on true science through cooperation. A true elite scientist would welcome the challenge and new findings rather than try and destroy the careers of others who challenge their flawed theories. UN/IPCC endorsed AGW put your 'elite' at the top and these last 17 years of flatline temperatures does not bode well as they have been clawing and conspiring to destroy the careers of any scientist who raised questions and pointed to our 17 year reality.

The Bible in Genesis 1:6 teaches that there was water above the sky. This condition doesn’t exist today because that water fell upon the earth during the great Noahic flood.The water above the sky would have had a greenhouse effect so that the temperature around the globe would have been uniform and tropical, even at the North and South poles.During the time of the Genesis flood, the Bible describes that the water above the sky fell and great amounts of water from under the earth broke through the surface. The violent combination of these forces produced the fossil layers and great canyons.Because there was no longer the thermal protection from waters that existed above the sky, the Polar Regions became instantly frozen. There are frozen mammoths discovered with undigested food still in their stomachs.

Methane is 100 times as potent a GHG gas as CO2.Both governments are well known to be deep in the pockets of Big Oil, both promoting gas as fast as Big Oil can dump it at half the cost of production in an effort to bypass nuclear and replace coal.For obvious reasons Big Oil pays Canada's Fascist government as well as Obama's big bucks to ensure neither the EPA nor Environment Canada measure methane emissions, nor include it as a measured GHG.At least in the US 5 new nuke plants are under construction so far at half cost the of the equivalent gas plant if built by public power. This dispute the best efforts of Big Oil's Obama to throw roadblocks in front of the states efforts.So far in Canada the combined forces of Big Oil's Fascist party and Big Oil's Greenpeace subsidiary have stopped Canadian nuclear in its tracks, giving away Canada's world class nuclear company to cronies at Gaddafi engineering in exchange for a promise to destroy the company, and promoting wind/solar with gas backup in Ontario.Big Oil's stupid fascists are so antinuclear that they are actively discouraging efforts to nuke the tar sands making them the cleanest oil operation in the world and eliminating all environmental opposition.There would be no opposition to the Tar Sands anywhere in the world if the stupid fascists running Alberta and boss Derharpenfuhrer, were to support Canada's University of Ottawa nuclear physicist David LeBlanc's proposal to nuke the tar sands with his Canadian invented best in the world DMSR nuclear reactor.

With the current crop of corrupt regulators these sharks just build the dirt cheap gas plant and pass the gas price costs on to the rate paying sucker while tacking on a 15% gratuity needed to satisfy the graft.Finally when a nuke plant shuts down all that decommissioning fund cash is instantly available to greedy utility managers, anxious over the source of their next quarterly bonus., These gentle souls are aware that almost nothing need be spent on the plant for the next 40 years in Safestor.

Even with a 20+ lead in the polls going into the last election, they found a way to lose and remain BC's Official Opposition. In the last 80+ years the BC NDP/Union Party has won only three elections.  Those three wins were because the right of centre parties split the vote.  This allowed the NDP/Union Party to come up the middle and form government.  The last BC election was confirmation the BC voters no longer find the BC NDP/Union Party relevant. The BC NDP/Union Party is a coalition of naive socialist and rank and file union members, mostly public service unions.  The party is run by big organized labour.  Around the world both socialism and unionism is on the decline. Now is time for the two factions of the BC NDP/Union Party to party company.  Both could form two separate political parties, both with their own agendas.  Such a move would remove the ability of the right of centre parties to unite the right because no common threat exists.  Without a common threat the right of centre parties would fragment into different political parties with they own unique perspectives. If this were to happen the BC voters would finally have a real choice because of the different agendas of each party and the polarization of BC politics would come to an end.

Exceptionally intelligent people who can analyse most situations; recognize where mistakes can be made and implement remedial actions to prevent mistakes.2. Average intelligent people make mistakes from time to time; learn from their mistakes and don't make the same mistake a second time.  Often, these same people can learn from mistakes that others make and ensure that they don't make the same mistakes.3. Then there is the third category of people ........It is obvious that many (most?) Western Politicians did not learn from the mistakes which were made prior to 2008/2009 which led to the major, world-wide recession from which we are struggling to recover from.  Prior to 2008/2009, Western Governments including the U.S., France and Britain, fueled unrealistic expectations amongst the average folks, wracked up huge government debts and allowed individuals to do the same and watched as their economies collapsed.  Of course, they ensured that the senior management of banks and major corporations such as GMC and Chrysler did not suffer and did not hold any of them to account for their unethical business practices.  These same Government officials watched as Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland declined politically and economically and milions of average persons (25%-50%) joined the ranks of the unemployed.  The main reason for these countries' demise was the unrealistic expectations of the people; that 'Governments' could and would continue to provide 'free' goods and services for the average person and the taxpayers would not have to pay.  Politicians were more than happy to 'buy votes with taxpayers' money'; promising ever increasing, 'free' goods and services provided by 'The Government' and the average, gullible folks, 'bought in' to the biggest scams in human history.  And many politicians in the U.S., France, Britain and Canada continue to ensure that the governments that they (mis)manage still spend more money than the governments collect in taxes, steadily increasing government (read citizens' / taxpayers') debt to astronomical levels;  still 'buying votes with taxpayers' dollars.  Very soon, the average citizen in all Western Countries will be paying a price never before imagined.

In his article, Barrie highlighted the fact that the Canadian Federal Government has insured approximately $900 Billion worth of mortgages.  For comparison, the total Federal Government Net Debt (read Canadian Taxpayers' Debt) is $676 Billion.  Three-quarters of all Canadian Mortgages are insured by the Federal Government (read by the Canadian Taxpayers).  In 1988, the Federal Government only insured 30 percent of Canadian Mortgages.  In 2007/2008, one of the causes of the massive economic decline in the U.S. (which reverberated around the world) was the failure of banks which loaned money and gave credit to anyone who walked through the door.  Many of these loans were backed by the U.S. Government (U.S. Taxpayer) and there was no accountability on the part of the Bank Managers who authorized loans to people who never should have qualified.  This is occurring now in Canada and the Canadian Taxpayer will be 'on the hook' when the system collapses (as it inevitably will).  So, at the Federal Government level, Canadian Taxpayers are liable for:1. $676 Billion in Federal Government Debt;2. $900 Billion in Federal Government mortgage guarantees;3. $XXX Billion in Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation Guarantees (up to $100,000 for each and every qualified bank account).Now, add the Provincial Government and Municipal Government Debts for whichever province and municipality in which readers reside and the picture is not pretty.
