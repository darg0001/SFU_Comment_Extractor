I too was there, overseas, and on one of the last direct cooperant contracts, and I saw the corruption that took over when it was decided that aid should be administered through private sector contracts. Those currently slagging the organisation are the ones who promoted that model. Their clients, the corporations, have turned to ever greater corruption to buy their contracts, worded for their own benefits, and then to buy the outcomes that meet the letter of those same contracts. The spirit went down the tubes with ideologically driven privatisation. Lavalin was one of those. So were several companies who worked on projects parallel to mine. My work was crippled by the fact that Canadian companies provided under-the-table budgets for their employees to bribe officials. Also while on direct contract to CIDA, I always found them welcoming, or at least respectful of criticism. When hired through a corporation, I was forbidden to mention our failures. That is the corruption that will now formally take the place of CIDA, which it infiltrated so long ago. A few NGOs have continued through the years, providing aid in a respectful, empowering, capacitating, and culturally and ethically sensitive basis. Remember KAIROS, and Bev Oda's doctored memo? That was one of them. Two words, then, that do not appear in Saunders article, because they have associations that hurt the government in power: Lavalin, and KAIROS. One had cronies in government, one did not. One was granted massive contracts, one had its very minor support cut, not by CIDA, but by the cabinet minister in charge.
